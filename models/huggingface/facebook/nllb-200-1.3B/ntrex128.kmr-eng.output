Members of the Welsh Assembly should consider appearing if they are eligible
Some Members of the House of Commons have argued that it is proposed that their name should be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This is part of the programme to rename the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the MJC from various political backgrounds are skeptical that this can lead to a resolution.
A member of the Workers' Party said his group was concerned that the name would be confused with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means d and pwp means g.
One Plaid member said his group was not satisfied with the overall performance and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group is open about changing the name but MWP and Muppet (the band) are two very similar sounds.
The Welsh alphabet should be pronounced as close as possible to the English alphabet and the Yorkshire dialect.
The Mejlis committee, which is currently preparing to introduce the amendment to the laws, said: "Of course, the final decision on any appeal of the Mejlis members will be in the hands of the members themselves".
The 2017 State of Wales Act gave the power to change the name to the Welsh Assembly.
In June it published the results of a public consultation on proposals that many supported calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the title of MPs, the Assembly wanted them to be Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the choice of the MWP in a public consultation won the most popular support.
Members of the Legislature are proposing alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching a compromise could be a major headache for the Chief Minister, Elin Jones, as she is expected to pass the bill within weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the parliament, such as provisions on the discharge of parliamentary members and the design of the parliamentary system.
The members of the Mejlis will vote on the final appeal during the legislative debate.
Macedonians are taking to the streets in a bid to change the name of their country.
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is being held to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the name of its supreme court represents a case on its own merits and has consistently opposed Macedonia's bid for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia's President Gjorje Ivanov, who is opposed to the name change, said he would not take the ban seriously.
However, supporters of the referendum, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change will be a matter of EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Bells are Cut, While Dogs Are Out in Harlem
Adams Beg said:  One night, the old people I talk to say that in every village there was a nursery and a mother.
"Today, none of them are missing.
He said that the destruction of the factories is understood.
He said that these days, people are meeting in different ways.
"The neighborhood is no longer a place to be regularly serviced".
As for the parents, it is a debate that the money from the sale of goods and services will not be available until the time when the pioneers hope,  and sooner or later they will return to the place where they started.
The mother's place, he added, will be filled by apartment buildings with floors, which will include people of all kinds who will not help the remaining neighbourhood residents.
"The majority of people who live in these buildings will be white", he said, "and they will probably have to speed up the day when these buildings are completely closed because it is very unlikely that most of those people who live in these properties will be white".
Both were built by the local parishes before Harlem became a blacksmith metropolis - the Metropolitan Society in 1870 or St. Martin's a decade later.
The Methodist congregation was disbanded in 1930.
A mob of black people who were near the temple blockaded the building.
St. Martin's was seized by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson who had boycotted the 125th Street, a major street for blacks in Harlem, against vendors who refused to drug or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, but when the parishioners of Father Johnson set out to rebuild, they also damaged the bell tower.
Bishop David Johnson, the curate of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, chanted the "Zingla of the Hungry People".
Experts who visited Zengil in July named it "a cultural treasure and an unforgettable instrument".
Tiffany NG, a University of Michigan expert, also noted that this was the first ever dance song to be produced by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had spent a year in Riverside, Michigan, seventeen years earlier.
Merriweather Beg said St. Martin's Church has not replaced him.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex story of architecture and investment, some brought by the city's pioneering leaders and others brought by the metropolitan area.
The board, which is responsible for the administration of the village and is composed of elected leaders, in July filed a complaint with the mayor's office to try to pay the costs to the administration, although the administration did not complicate the closure of the buildings and the investors sent by the mayor.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency from the metropolitan area.
A 13-year-old boy is raped by a mob in California during a deep-sea dive
A senior official said Sehmasiyek was attacked and injured by a 13-year-old boy who had left the water to arrest the assailants on Saturday, the first day of the assault season.
The attack took place before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he and his friends spent about an hour in the water on Saturday, where the children were screaming for help, and then came to him with several friends to help him out.
Hammel said he first thought it was only because of the possibility of a stag being caught, but then he felt the child had to be moved.
I was visited!'
When he reached the child, he had all the keys on his shoulder, Hammel said.
"I told everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a fish in the water!' " Hammel added.
The child was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The type of attackers are not known.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a seashell was found in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was determined that it was not an endangered species of seashells.
Giles added that the rated car was located in the upper part of the injured body.
Authorities from Casablad's Ponto Beach have detained the beach's head of Swami Ecinitas for reasons of investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sawdust in the region, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's map for entry into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's caters to the needs of the most demanding retailers, including Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of a major push to enter the UK's 2.8 billion pound beauty market which continues to grow at a time when sales of fashion and home furnishings are falling, the more expensive beauty shows will be launched at 11 stores across the country's w3i circuit and if successful will be shipped to more stores next year.
Every supermarket is looking for a way to use the upper parts of the fence, which used to be used for televisions, airplanes and household appliances, to save on beauty.
Sainsbury's said it will double the size of its beauty products to 3,000, and will first market brands such as Revlom, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
More space will be allocated to existing varieties of LOreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees, with marked areas like those found in Bootse stores.
The ec supermarket also introduces a new type of makeup to make most products more skin-friendly  something that is increasingly sought after by the retailers.
Similarly, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will conduct trials at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened a week ago in Craydon, south London, and the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
The online trend and a shift towards people getting a small daily ration from small shops means that supermarkets should do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will become more like supermarkets as supermarket chains try to compete with the affordable Aldi and Lidl stores, which offer more services than just food.
Sainsbury's has sold hundreds of Argos products in its stores since it split the two chains two years ago, and has introduced a number of Habitats products that it says have helped it sell more shells and increase profits.
The final stage of the supermarket's cosmetic and medical cleaning was completed in a timely manner.
Sainsbury's had tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but this came to an end after a dispute over the source of revenue distribution from pharmacies in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds chain, for £125m three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would be adding a role to the map by adding a wide range of luxury brands of skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the name, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have developed our own unique sense of beauty to create an environment for our customers.
We also agreed to have our specially trained colleagues available for the proposal.
Our brands are designed according to each need and the attractive environment and the convenient locations mean that we are now a beautiful beauty center that balances the old ways of doing things".
Peter Jones is shocked after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11m deal
'Dragons Den' actor Peter Jones is in shock after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an £11million deal with his eponymous brand to focus on his relationships with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for her own brand of accessories and clothing.
The business is owned by Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has confirmed that "Dragons Den" actor Peter Jones is leaving the entertainment business at the last minute to focus on his lucrative new business deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was reportedly "shocked" when the TV presenter's daughter confirmed on Tuesday at a briefing in his business empire office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new business - which has a £1.5 million revenue - means she has no time to spare for home accessories and clothing.
He was the businessman behind Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and intended to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was planning to leave early, Jones left the UK for one of her holiday homes.
"Holly's highest-rated episode was really good", a source said.
It would be its long-term future to be delivered in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw is clearly confusing.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday, it was just the beginning.
There was nothing for sale in Marlow's office.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning host, who is one of the richest artists in the UK, could have cost the company millions as it invested in a range of products from shampoo and cosmetics to clothes and underwear and household items, and was likely to start late in the future.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for a decade.
Willoughby joined Cappa in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
The brothers reunited and Jones has a 50% share of the Baldwin TV production in 40 episodes.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that last night, "We were not allowed to comment on the business".
The discussion was intense  and then we were hurt
He was criticized by some news media for his assessment that some "deserve the presidency" and that he is similar to the development in the North Korean coast.
Why did President Trump delay so much?
Trump said with a sigh, "Listen to an anchor".
I don't know anything about things.
Trump said Kim would like to meet again after the initial meeting in Singapore in April, which Trump said was a major push for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament is over.
Three months after the Singapore meeting, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Hodi told the General Assembly of world leaders at the UN on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "dual response" from the US to North Korea in the first stages.
He also said that the US continues to threaten to stay on the sidelines.
Trump gave a more elegant view in his speech.
"We are doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We drink with the people of North Korea.
Millions of people were being killed.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts with Kim have improved and achieved positive results - completing missile tests, helping to free prisoners and returning American troops home.
He maintained his negative relations with the KIM in his speech on his involvement in the KIM
"It's easy to become president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get to this place of tension, only 200 people are here", Trump said, referring to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and tsunami killed hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok protests, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Despite the displacement of 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national plague was declared, a hurdle to facilitate international aid.
"Sometimes, unfortunately, they are very clear that they do not want international support, because it is somewhat hostile", Sumbung said.
Although a team is needed to move the child to Palu, it is not clear that foreign workers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the regional news agency, said Indonesian authorities are looking into the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be able to provide assistance.
As Indonesia's land continues to erode, the country remains under siege from the threat of a tsunami.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they were not installed on the other side of the coast.
The lack of a clear warning for the tsunami in Palu, where a single warning can be a lot of work, could lead to many lives being lost.
In the best of times, it is difficult to travel between the islands of Indonesia.
The complexity of the logistics filet further complicates the process.
A ship hospital set up in Lombok to treat earthquake victims will be moved to Palu, but it will take three days to move to the new site.
President Joko Widodo has made building Indonesia's scattered infrastructure his election focus, and he has saved money on building roads and railways
However, the budget cuts have devastated Joko's government, as he is up for re-election next year.
Joko is also under pressure and sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members are mostly Muslim in a form of muhaafikar faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Muslim groups and militias fought in the streets with stones, axes, wood and other weapons.
Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge was the reason Liverpool were saved in the Premier League in the 89th minute against Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was sent off by Shakir's side as he was about 30 goals from Chelsea's goal, and his team was still 1-0 down.
He then guides his side of the ship before heading to the remote post.
The attempt caused the gok to pass through the upper right corner of the grid at the height of the square.
The goal was to get the ball into the net on the top of the Arrizabalaga.
"We just wanted to get to that point where they get to the goal and players like Shaq are always playing as long as they can, so I'm trying to get ready when I have time", Sturridge told Liverpool FC. com.
"I saw Kante coming and standing in front of me and I was thinking a lot about it and I was shocked.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the second half, after beating Belgian striker Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
Chelsea's goalkeeper Mateo Kovacic was sent off in the second half of the match, before being sent off to Liverpool's centre-back side.
Kovacic quickly advanced in the middle of the field.
He then burned a good opportunity, and set the square on fire.
The threat fell on the defence and he was able to pass the goal by the post and by Alisson Becker to Liverpool.
Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 pm at Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face the UEFA Europa League on Videotron at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia reaches 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami telepaths in Indonesia reached 832, the Indonesian filaket agency said Sunday morning.
The report said that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that were destroyed by the earthquake.The 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday caused waterfalls with a height of 20 meters, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.

A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a house.
In the afternoon, friends who claimed to know the woman came on stage to ask where the woman's name would be found in the morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police said they are in the process of informing the victims and the families.
A taxi driver who was staying at Grayson Mews apartment tried to return to his home but police said no one could enter or leave the building.

Cromwell's parliamentary impeachment becomes the latest in a series of "re-writes of history"
Her legacy is as a poetic adviser to his Taliban legacy in the face of the dismantling of England's cultural and sectarian power by his puritan disciples.
But Cromwell Council said Mr Crick's suggestions were "reckless" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell Council, said: "He was the one who said and said that the cremation of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Abbey would be a target.
The conflicts and civil wars in England were neither authorized nor instigated by Oliver Cromwell.
It is unlikely that Cromwell was mistakenly and accidentally to have been a follower of the activities of his father Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's greatest presentation at Cromwell's Bar is a vivid record of 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of a figure that many have not learned to trust has the value of being celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is, by many, more colourful in the 19th century than he is today, as the parliamentary defender against external pressure, according to his predecessor.
Whether it is a very accurate representation is itself a matter of constant historical debate and debate.
What is certain is that the split of the mid-17th century gave a boost to our nation's development, and Cromwell is a well-known figure who was one of the participants in that split.
His achievements as a paragon are worthy of respect and memory.
Killer Berza beats Chinese farmer to death
A gunman in southwest China attacked and killed a farmer, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only as Yuan, was found unconscious and with deep injuries, in a pool of blood near a market in Guizhou province, China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
a bear farmer prepares to wake a bear in a beech on May 30, 2005 in Qinghai Province, China.
It was reported that they had come from Yunnan province with their wife on Wednesday to buy 15 bonds at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead, and the door to the neighbor's house was open.
He said he saw a large, blood-filled look on the page.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the family of the deceased, who was reportedly killed by a 550-pound farmer.
"My grandfather's pencils were bloody and muddy", his grandfather, who was named Wu, said in a statement reported by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the pag on Friday at 4.40 a.m. to feed the villagers
His body was found about an hour later.
He concluded that the yuan that killed him was not his or his grandmother's.
The market manager told Evening News that he was restrained from assaulting anyone, while police were gathering evidence and files at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are discussing the cost of his death.
However, cases of alleged human rights violations have been documented.
In 2016, a man and a woman were attacked by a bear on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound Welsh horse had stuck his ax to the tractor and fled after his wife had frightened the horse.
After a Oregon farmer was kidnapped by a raccoon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC that the farmers were not aggressive with a wetsuit, and that blood transfusions could be "damaging".
They're just playing.
They are very gentle, they are very gentle ... they don't want to hurt you.
"You should only take the necessary steps for them", he said.
The aftermath of the Rosa storm brings heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, the Rosa storm is moving gently due to the icy waters in northern Mexico.
However, Rosa will see heavy rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosario was hit by winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 storm, from 5 a.m. on Sunday Eastern Time, and 385 miles southwest of Mexico's Punta Eugenia.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
At the same time, a storm is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward along the west coast of the United States. In the same situation that Rosa is near the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will explore a moderate tidal wave from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will see up to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical cyclones with transitions associated with rainfall will bring heavy rains to the Southwest in the coming days.
The region will see 1 to 4 inches of rainfall, which will cause flooding, mudslides, and landslides in the desert.
Tropical rainfall in some areas will cause rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per week, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly in most of Arizona.
The storm is expected to be a severe drought with severe weather conditions and a tropical storm.
Patients are strongly advised to walk out into the wilderness when the threat of tropical rains begins.
Heavy rains can cause rivers to overflow and storm surges and dust.
The approaching storm is expected to bring heavy rains to some points along the southern California coast.
Rainfall is expected to be about half an inch, which can lead to minor flooding and road traffic congestion.
This will be the first rainfall in the district during the warm season.
Some heavy rains will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before intensifying late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains are expected to intensify on Tuesday and continue until late Wednesday.
October across the Americas may see some very warm weather patterns, but the tropics will be very warm.
This often leads to dramatic changes in the short term.
There is a good example of temperature variations on Sunday across the United States.
There is a 20-degree time difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the continuing air temperature will try to rise again.
Most of South and Central America is expected to see a warm start to October with temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Hemisphere to some points in the Northeast.
New York City could see temperatures reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows high heat potential for the eastern United States in mid-October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's rally
More than 20 million people watched the testimony on Thursday on six television channels of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who convicted him of sexual assault that occurred at Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s.
At the same time, a political row continues, with releases tied to the Friday's interim schedule: a deal brokered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI calls for a one-week investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had shot herself while she was drunk and trying to take her clothes off at a party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, said that it was 100 percent that it hadn't happened.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people watched the show on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company counts the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The complaints were not addressed by other networks that aired the show, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Show.
And Nielsen usually has some problems knowing how many people on the board have watched that show.
To illustrate, it is about the size of a football game or an Academy Award winner.
Nielsen said Fox News, which confirmed the views of hosts with Kavanaugh's support, led to a total of 5.69 million viewers on all channels during the entire day's session.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million and CNN was 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The floor was still on after the meeting.
Flake appeared as the main character in the drama Friday.
After the Republican caucus office announced that he would be running for moderate office to vote for Kavanaugh, footage of him being recorded by CNN and CBS showed protesters scolding him as he tried to appear before a meeting of the House Committee on Elections.
He was shown with eyes that were about a few inches below the table, and his images were shown in a live stream on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he will tell the truth to the country?"
She was told, "You are stronger than many women are weak".
Flake said his office announced that before the elevator door was opened, he would have a lot to say at the committee meeting.
Several hours later, several media networks and cable networks broadcast the broadcast live, as the Judiciary Committee sought to vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only if he understood that the FBI would look into allegations against the candidate next week, which the Democrats are trying to do.
Flake was reassured in a conversation with his Democratic colleague, Senator Chris Coons.
After speaking in front of Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's nomination was strong, as it was clear that Republicans could not nominate Kavanaugh without a review.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.

Wayde Sims murdered: Police suspect in murder of LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police are investigating the murder of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on suspicion of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police said.
Authorities released a video showing a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his foreheads during the fight.
Police collected a bottle of his scraps at the scene and obtained Simpson's DNA on it, WAFB reports CBS affiliated.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had admitted to giving up to die in Wayde.
Advocate announced that it was valued at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office Eastern reported in a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The state calls on the Louisiana State Police Crime Victims' Watch Force, the state's Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local citizens to assist in the investigation and apprehension of the perpetrator.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked them for their efforts to bring justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 offensive lineman grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply saddened" and "shocked" by the news of Wayde's death.
"It makes you feel good all the time", Wade said.
Volcanoes roar over Mexico City
The volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Philatelic Protection on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity at the crater increased and 183 explosions of gas and ash were reported in 24 hours.
The center monitored smuggling and threatened.
Images on social media show the faces of people in neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have been warning of increased volcanic activity 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude quake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
Volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police fight with Catalan protesters ahead of the independence referendum.
Six people clashed with police in Barcelona on Saturday after their independence demonstration, with thousands of rival protesters joining in to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's politicisation of apartheid.
A group of anti-Semitic protesters, who were shown with colored eggs by the riot police, had created a haze of dust and mud in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The clashes with police began in the late afternoon in Baton.
Within hours, pro-independence groups chanting "No forget, no dismiss" were confronted by a wave of unilateral protesters chanting "Let's go to Spain".
Fourteen people were medically assisted for minor injuries, local media reported.
The issue in the autonomous region remained at a high level until a year after the referendum of 1 January, which was banned by Madrid, but was celebrated by Catalonia.
Voters chose independently, despite the participation of those who opposed segregation and generally boycotted voting.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people have been injured in the past year after police attempted to stop voting at ballot boxes across the region, which has been plagued by violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out last night to prevent pro-national police protests from taking place.
The protest continued, but forcibly moved in a different direction.
Narcis Termi, 68, an electrician who participates with his wife in the protest, says he is not interested in Catalonia becoming independent.
Last year we had a very nice life.
He said, "I used to watch my parents looking for joy to be able to vote but now we are afraid.
Despite the important leadership and the victory of several parties in the regional elections of January last year, the pro-independence parties of Catalonia struggled to celebrate the march alongside the best leaders, both those who were dismissed and those who were dismissed, and with the possibility of being prosecuted for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming the protest in support of police, said the fighting was complicated by politicians from both sides.
He said "the disease is getting worse and worse",
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
He said that "candidate for European elections is the best leader to communicate the values of democracy and violence that we have seen from the Spanish government".

The incident was reported at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19.30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage had reached the door and the building.
There is a possibility that a driver also dropped the car at the same point.
Menga's struggle becomes reason for Livingston's 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first lake to sanctify Livingston
Livingston was the Rangers' leading scorer, taking Steven Gerrard's second-most goals in his 18 seasons as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's struggle shows that there must be a difference in time for Gary Holt's side to level up with Hibernian.
Ali Gerrard remains winless in the Premier League this season and will face the Hearts leaders on Sunday, who are eight points behind.
The Ranger are therefore hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, in that division, has clinched his sixth game, with Holt's lead still under threat of breaking during Kenny Miler's replacement next month.
Livingston misses chances against disgruntled guests
The Holt team must move forward with their own straightforwardness before they can capture the points that have caused the Rangers so many problems.
Scott Robinson scored but continued his struggle against his target, then only Alan Lithgow managed to continue the way with a wide-body shot to allow Craig Halkett to score with a headshot.
The hosts were happy to have Rangers play against them, knowing they could make the tournament uncomfortable for the spectators.
And that's how the most important goal was achieved.
Rangers gave a free-kick and Livingston scored, while Declan Galagher and Robinson tried to catch Menga, who scored from the centre of the quarter.
At this stage, Rangers were in control of the goal but their home defence was useless and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was in a wide comfort.
He continued to play in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos barely escaped Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's request to cancel Scott Pittman's kick and Lithgow's dismissal by another shot from Livingston.
The game was abandoned after two penalty shootouts - one after Halkett's Glenn Middleton substitution and one for a handball.

Performance and winning score for Livingston.
For a man, they were very good, constantly passing on the hopes of this triumph.
Their playing style and staff have not changed since their return to the top flight, but there is a great credit to Holt as he has developed the team considerably since his association with the team.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was also very effective, delivering a smooth and accurate shot, although Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were not sharp and ready.
However, the Rangers were unimpressed.
They were so well equipped under Gerrard that they were powerless by the absence of these standards.
Their last goal was useless - they could only enter their stadium once - and it served as a warning to the Rangers who were already in the middle of the table.
Erdogan hosted in Cologne with a joint reception
The meeting between the Turkish and German leaders in Berlin on Saturday (29 September) was a joint effort.
The last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany was a busy one, with the aim of improving the situation of NATO allies who have been disadvantaged.
They focused on issues of equal rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's obligations to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Koln to inaugurate the new grand mosque.
It is the largest city with a Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police disrupted the security force for security reasons before the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters were close to seeing their leader.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurds - took to the streets, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to spend Erdogan on Germany.
The dual protests show the split of a guest into two parts, one as a hero for some German Turks and the other by others who are identified as autocrats or authors.
Deptford road crash: Cyclist dies in crash with car
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car was stopped and rescue workers were present, but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened a few months after the death of another cyclist on Childers Street, just 1 mile from the scene, and the driver collided with the car.
The Metropolitan Police said that the police would be dispatched to determine the identity of the deceased and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses were diverted to find out what happened and vehicle owners were told to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in the disarmament
The prison office says six police officers were injured in a break-in in the high-security men's prison.
The clashes at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire took place at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are ongoing.
The Specialist Tornado officers were deployed to resolve the conflict, which has resulted in the displacement of eight prisoners and one ward.
The officers who had minor injuries at the scene were treated.
The spokesperson of the Prison services said: "The prison staff are specially trained to deal with the ongoing activities at HMP Long Lart Lartin.
Six staff members were not taken to the hospital for treatment.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be transferred to the police and there is a possibility of a long incarceration.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous.
In June, it was reported that the prison's warden was shot by a prisoner after an attack on the prison.
In October, the prison sent anti-riot police to solve a serious incident involving a prison worker who was injured with billiards.
Rosa Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake threatened with severe flooding
A storm is unlikely to make landfall in Arizona, but it is likely to make landfall in the southwest Arizona desert early next week as a remnant of Hurricane Rosa and overwhelm the state with strong winds.
The National Weather Service is forecasting heavy rainfall Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa, which is expected to make landfall in Phoenix late Monday with rain, is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
Phoenix's National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical storms since 1950 have caused tropical storms or extreme weather in Phoenix's 200 miles!
Katrina (1967) was a flood 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center forecast forecasts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with a peak of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest Sahara including the Middle Rockies and the Great Basin may be 1 to 2 inches, with a total prominence of up to 4-inches.
For those who are far from the danger of the leafy bush, Rosa is a mercy offering because the area has become dry.
Although the drought is a very serious one, some of this rain will be with a side effect as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the US Weather.com report, "Dry observation, only 40% of Arizona experiences extreme drought, the second highest category".
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa is heading toward the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, with winds of 85 mph on Sunday morning, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is subject to tidal waves in the Aram Sea, which means its power is reduced.
Therefore, it is estimated that in Mexico, a typhoon will hit Mexico in the evening or night of Monday.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is expected to cause severe flooding.
Weather.com reported that "rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is forecast in Baja California due northwest of Sonora, with a potential rainfall of up to 10 inches.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before moving to the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a weak tropical storm, which will then rise over Arizona and move south over Utah by late Tuesday night.
The main threat from Rosa or its remnants is severe rainfall, in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. National Typhoon Center said, "Southwest B".
The rain is expected to cause devastating floods in the fields and mountains.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for the crime of murder
A 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Somerset, following which three journalists and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.
The body was found at 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer, Norton.
He was taken to hospital and is currently in a critical condition.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old girls and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset districts on Saturday night.
Police have requested cooperation from all those who filmed the incident on their mobile phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh has fallen for the "crazy and angry" Democratic Party
Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia, that "Judge Kavanaugh's voice is one of unwavering defiance of the Democratic Party's cruel and vindictive methods".
Trump said Kavanaugh was "confused" with the "democratic" and "democratic" party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the U.S. Congress on Thursday and falsely accused Christine Blasey Ford of sexually abusing Kavanaugh for decades in a series of news stories.
Christine Blasey Ford withdrew her claim in court.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's courage, quality and manliness".
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia: "The confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the confirmation vote for one of the most successful litigators of our time and one of the most praised workers in public service.
The president indirectly criticized Kavanaugh's candidacy during his speech on the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
He said: "We have five weeks until the start of one of the most important elections of our era.
I am not a candidate, but I am a candidate in fact.
That's why I'm running for the top candidates everywhere.
Trump claimed that Democrats are "setting themselves up and removing barriers".
One of the GOP executive's top advisers told CNN that the first vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh will be held no later than Thursday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number of victims is rising.
At least 384 people have died and many more are stranded due to the eruption of massive waves in the tropics.Indonesian authorities announced on Saturday that a earthquake and tsunami had hit the island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Monday to attend a festival in the port city of Palu, where a wave of six metres (18 feet) of water reached the port, killing several people and destroying buildings near the port.
The tsunami was caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesian National Park Management Board (BNPB) said at a news conference in Jakarta: "During the tsunami, people were busy with their medical work and were killed because they did not respond quickly.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "We were not only affected by the Tsunami, the Tsunami movement destroyed cars, trees, houses and everything on the ground by itself".He added that the Tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 Km/h (497 miles/h) before reaching the treatment.
He said that some people climbed trees and threw themselves to death to escape the tsunami.
About 16700 people have been relocated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the Natural Disasters Administration show several buildings and shops being destroyed, a mosque surrounded by water, and a bridge being demolished.
The day of the Sabbath after the Passover was celebrated in this city.
The post-election was held in a district with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Evaluation and Application Administration (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the lunar eclipse on Monday was about 200 times the nuclear power of Hiroshima during World War II.
According to the report, the city's location at the end of a high and thin valley has increased the impact of the tsunami.
Nugroho said the damage was "extensive" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were damaged.
According to him, the bodies of some gorillas were found under the collapsed buildings and the number of injured is 540 people, 29 of whom are missing.
Nugroho said the level of damage and the number of landslides were higher in the 300-kilometer (190-mile) northern Palu administrative line, named after the Donggala district near the epicenter.
"The peace lines in Donggala have been completely cut", Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live in the area.The Red Cross said in a statement that its peacekeepers and volunteers had already moved into the affected areas.
According to the report of the Red Cross: "A disaster has occurred, but the situation is more serious".
The administration was criticized on Saturday for its timing of the tsunami in Palu, but officials said the tsunami had been raised during the temporary alert.
In the video of the incident, which was posted on social media, a man's voice is heard from the roof of a building, alerting people in the streets of the imminent tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water falls on the toilet and engulfs the house and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages and the disruption of the communications lines around Palu, making it difficult for the relief workers to coordinate their efforts.
According to the officials, the army has sent charter planes from Jakarta and other cities to the district, but the Zayandite population is in need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport is open for humanitarian operations only and will be closed until October.
According to the program, President Joko Widodo visited the rehabilitation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
This is a very sad situation.
Mr. Dosebba said: "Although World Vision's Donggalai workers have reached Palu City safely and the workers are deployed in the outer corners of the office grounds, the ruins have been seen on the way.
They told me they saw several houses collapsed.
This is a very sad situation.
Although aid groups have started to provide assistance for the preparation of the event, some criticism has been leveled at the prevention of preparing foreign memos with evidence in Palu.
According to Indonesian law, the transfer of foreign aid, loans and grants is only possible in the case of a zone being declared as a "National Wildlife Refuge".
This has not been done yet.
Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: "This buyer is still at the provincial level.
After the state declared it as a National Disaster, we can get international aid, but so far no such situation has been reported.
With two nights since the earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the victims are still hoping that their remains will be a miracle that will change the story of the natural world.
On Saturday, a rabbit was removed from the road.
On Sunday, the firing squad fired a woman who had been trapped under the covers for two days at her mother's bedside.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian National Para Glayder Team, trained two of the original Para Glaydors for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were blocked at the Roa Roa Hotel were Mr. Mangagi, one of his students.
He said: "I am under a lot of pressure as a Paraglaider.
Mr. Gandon said that in the early hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel was published, he sent several messages through WhatsApp to the paddle skaters who were engaged in the training festival.
However, alongside his messages, a row of two blue checks, only the letter Gewr appeared (i.e. the message was not read and understood).
He said: "In my opinion, this message was not delivered".
The $26,750 fee was paid by filling an ATM at Newport Levee.
According to a report by the Newport Police Department, about $26,750 was stolen Monday morning from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport Lev.
The driver was busy installing an ATM device at a central bank and preparing to deposit money, according to a report by Dennis McCarthy.
While he is busy, another man runs to Brink and takes a wallet full of money from the ATM.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not make any estimates on the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with suspicions about the identity of these individuals should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper who goes by the name Yegu.
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
She announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "My official name is Kanye West".
West, 41, has used the pseudonym Ye for her eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was announced ahead of his preparation for the Saturday night live show, where he is set to release his new album Yandhi.
The show's producer announced that Kanye West will replace Ariana Grande, who has dropped out of the show for emotional reasons.
Ye is a shortened version of his former and current stage name.Kanye West has previously stated that the word is also important to him from a religious perspective.
West announced during an interview on the album's title track on the radio program called Big Boy: "For me Ye is one of the most common words in the Bible and means tu in practice.
But ... I am you, I am we, he is us.
This word is taken from kanī meaning only one, only Ye just a return to the good, the bad, the bad and all of our things.
This album is more than a return to our identity.
He is one of the famous rappers who change his name.
Sean Combs (born September 7, 1979) was known as Puff Daddy, P Diddy or Diddy, but he is better known by the nicknames Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z has since changed its name or dropped the line from its former West affiliates.
AMLO probe in Mexico for non-use of force against civilians
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against civilians at the beginning of the 50th anniversary of the student genocide.
Lopiz Obirador vowed on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Square to never use martial force against the people of Mexico.
On October 2, 1968, the forces of the popular uprising, which had quietly marched on the square, opened fire and killed 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements in Latin America were in the process of being organized.
Lopez Obrador promised to give monthly grants to students and increase the number of free universities to fund the scholarships.
He said that youth unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are caused by criminal groups.
The United States should repeat the Artificial Intelligence incident.
With China's expanding AI work, the United States should be repeating its case in this area, said Fu Lee, an AI investor and executive who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The views of various parts of the United States government center on the importance of Artificial Intelligence. Although the United States is not an official administration in this regard, it is a government agency that is responsible for the protection of the public interest.
Meanwhile, China announced its program last year, transitioning to the first player in the field of Artificial Intelligence innovation by 2030.
Lee said: "Return to the case of mind-controlled research would be a proper move, as other countries are far behind the U.S. in this area and we are following further developments in this area.
Repeating the incident would make it more likely that further developments in the U.S. would be detected, Lee said this week.
Lee, who published his book "Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the Global Innovation System" this month for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, and has invested in one of China's most prestigious Artificial Intelligence companies.
He worked on the Architectural Mind in the 1980s at Kareng Milon University, which would eventually become one of the most successful American Othello players. He later became one of Microsoft's research directors and the Chairman of Google's China division.
Lee confirms U.S. state competitions such as the robotic question on the basis of advanced research programs in nursing and asks when competitions will be held to identify other memory people.
Lee said U.S. researchers will have to work harder to get state funding.
"The Chinese do not employ teachers, but the company does", Lee said.
F.B, Google and some tech companies have in recent years started to employ top-ranked university professors in the field of Artificial Intelligence.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could strengthen U.S. efforts in the area of Armed Intelligence.
He said: "In my opinion, it is necessary for the holders of the doctorate in the field of the painted mind to be granted green cards in a spontaneous manner.
The State Council of China released its next-generation Artificial Mind program in 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China is funded by members of scientific institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state institutions are funded by American researchers ... but in Lee's view the quality of scientific work in China is at a lower level.
The U.S. Department of Defense has announced the creation of a joint center for the study of artificial intelligence, which will be open to colleagues from the private sector and universities, and the White House has announced the creation of a joint center for the study of artificial intelligence.
Last month, Darpa published news of a $2 billion investment in a platform called Al Next.
However, the NSF currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, there has been no news for months since the passage of the US law establishing the National Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonia's investigation into the name change.
Macedonians took part in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, in a move to end a decade-long dispute with Greece over the country's membership in the EU and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, is concerned that the name of its Northern embassy could violate the sovereignty of its territory, thus hindering its membership in the EU and NATO.
The two states adopted a resolution on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents have argued that the change is a weakening of the national identity of the more Slavic people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not participate in the referendum and the implementation of the boycott campaign is causing doubts about achieving a 50 percent turnout for the referendum.
The question in the poll document is: Do you support the EU membership, along with the resolution with Greece?
Proponents of the internal transition, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, are concerned about the possibility of Macedonia joining the EU and NATO, which is one of the countries that emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje, says she came here today to vote for the future of Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely under the EU, because this membership increases the security of our lives forever.
A significant number of parliamentarians have reported that they are aware of the results of the investigation and will be able to make their final decision, but this is not legally complete.
The name change is subject to the agreement of two-thirds of the parliamentary representatives.
The state election commission said it had not received any reports of unrest as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of those who registered to vote had taken part.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, from the capital (Skopje) said: "I vote for my children and my class in Europe.
Prime Minister Zorvan Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son-in-law Doshko took part in the referendum on the name change of the country to Estoromakia Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was busy preparing a small staircase and placing a flagpole in front of the parliament building in Skopje by the hands of those who boycotted the inquiry.
"We are supporters of the EU and NATO, but we want to enter them with dignity, not as servants.
We are a poor country but we are a kingdom
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can reach out to China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zayed said that our membership in NATO will be the reason for the capital inflow, which has reached a zero-discrimination rate of 20 percent.
Zayed said: "In my opinion, more people will vote yes, because 80 percent of our people are in favour of Europe and NATO.
He said that it will be approved in the sense of future misogyny.
A recent poll by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters are more likely to vote in the poll than the other participants.
Telma TV's survey in Macedonia shows that 57% of respondents said they would participate in the poll on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent voted yes
The investigation is confident that the rate will be more than 50 percent.
The defeat of this coup would be a serious coup in the politics of the pro-Western state that came to power in May last year.

Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president, in his speech, emphasized the importance of the presence of conservatives in the midterm elections, with the case of Brett Kavanaugh, the person who nominated him to the high court.
He said: "In November, all their achievements were put at risk.
The election is expected to be held in five weeks.
This is one of the biggest, biggest -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm a candidate, and so I'm running for more candidates everywhere.
Trump continued: "You see this group of brutal democratic architecture, you see the current disasters.
They are on this belief that they will gain power in any way and you will see impurity and evil.
They don't care where the coup is, they don't care if they are undermined to gain power, they care about power and capability, and we won't give it to them.
He claims to be a democrat and to do evil.
He tells the Democrats: "You see, in the last four days, they've been stupid and bad and lying".
He had openly disagreed with the elected senator of the judiciary committee of the sina, Diyan Feynestayn, and was interviewed for this.
How long did you remember his answer?
Did you publish this document?!
What?
No, no, I'm waiting for someone with a really great body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer the church's liberal faction.
This faction does not tolerate those who express their views.
I am not surprised that this family did not vote in my local party.
I am the last person in the list of representatives of the Workers' Party who are being rejected for declaring equality.
Jan Riyan, my colleague in parliament, was exposed to this movement because he was clearly against those who reject Judaism
As for me, I was criticized by the censorship movement for being violent with Kerem Korbin.
He spoke about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, and about issues like those that the Carmelites fought against in the past.
In a statement issued by the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Monday, it was stated that "we want this meeting to be complete and productive".
During the eight years I worked as a local representative of the Workers' Party, the Sunday night GC meetings were exactly the same.
The fact that there is no such movement in many of the churches today, and the promise of a more "compassionate", "loose" policy, would have been forgotten, but if there had been such a thing before.
It is becoming increasingly clear that opposing views are not being incorporated into the Labour Party and that belief in their legitimacy is being lost to party leaders.
This process started somewhat after the beginning of the Charitable Leadership Round, as colleagues with whom I had previously shared a political view gradually asked me to recant my beliefs.
Every time I give a speech to the public - and it's really not important what I say - they are insulting me on social media with the aim of withdrawing me, crediting the central politics and leaving the Labour party.
And this experience is not unique to me.
I know I'm more proud of myself than my colleagues because the criticism I get is mostly political.
The ridicule and backlash from my colleagues who face daily sexual and racial discrimination and still don't back down; I find it very strange.
One of the most difficult aspects of this political series is to fight against injustice.
The Labour Party's leader, Karim Korbin, said last week that he was in favour of increasing the level of activity of the party.
The truth is that we no longer have this church-liberation speech and with every demand for "religious change" or change in the electoral laws, it becomes more difficult to get involved with the party.
I was asked not to work two years ago, and not to participate in public events so that I could be accepted.
However, I did not join politics with this goal in mind.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, and the reason for that was because the state of Thatcher did not want to take my school vacation, and I was working in the district counsel's office or the state ministry to provide public services to people in need.
I have never expressed my political views, even in the recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East has disagreed with my political views and the opposition to the current leader.
To those who have been pushing this movement on Monday, I must say that as the country faces the Brexit crisis that will cause the loss of homes, infrastructure and public services, I am causing a waste of time and energy to speak about my pledge to the Labour leadership.
But my main message to Nottingham Momentum, perhaps to my clients, whether Labour Party members or others, is: Serving you is a place of pride for me, and I promise not to risk losing membership or political interest before carrying out the work that I know is on the backs of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Irish Rebellion is over.
Two late attempts to a certain extent altered the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this very exciting competition in Tennent's Premiership.
They are currently the top seed in the tournament and are the No. 1 seed in the Big Ten.
In the end it was their unparalleled defense and better use of opportunities by them that the hosts won and made the situation to the delight of the team's coach, "Peter Murchie".
He said: "We have been tested in our competitions and we have not learned and we should be happy".
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "I salute Ayr, they used their chances better than us".
A 14th-minute try by Grant Anderson, who was matched by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to the lead, but a yellow card awarded to Rory Hughes, the captain of the Scotland team, ruled him out of the next match with the Warriors, and Jason Baggot scored the try.
Kilimo defended Ayr with a key penalty and scored a try (hewileke) before the first half to send Ayr into the break with a 17-5 score.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's (three) points, matched by Bagot's, led to five.
A long break in the race was caused by the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who was out with Brankard, and Ayr added more points after the race restart with a Stafford McDowall effort that led to Kilmo's penalty.
Ayr's second-in-command Blair Macpherson was awarded the yellow card and Melrose faced a pointless tray from Bruce Colvine at the end of a tight period.
However, the hosts regained their strength after Struan Hutchinson was knocked out by a goalless draw at Kilmo behind the penalty line-out, and MacPherson was knocked out behind the attack line during Ayr's first-ever appearance.
Kilmo scored, almost as if he had done it all over again from the start, after Kyle Rowe had set up David Armstrong's box and sent a punch, Gregor Henry sent the team to win their first-ever Trophy.

The couple announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the show and it seems that Kieran has the heart to prepare for life after Craiglang.
According to the official recording list, he is the director of the company Adriftmorn.
The actress did not say anything about the story, but the Ish SunScott source estimated that Kirenan is following the launch of the Zengine Restaurant Management Company in Glasgow.
Our door is: A landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific.
The two are in a state of emergency at the bipergal naval office in La Paz.
The state flag is raised in dark blue.
The Navy's barracks from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the slogan: "The door is ours".
It is our duty to restore it.
In the besieged country of Bolivia, the memory of the supply line to Chile during the 19th century proxy war is still alive, as the people hope to see the Aramean Ocean again.
This hope has reached its zenith in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits the ruling of the International Court of Justice, which is due to be delivered on October 1 after five years of dictatorship.
The Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said: "Bolivia is the goddess of morality, wine, harmony and the reward of good results".
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling as a gross error at the national level and hope that the Laha Tribunal will confirm Chile's claim that - after decades of irregular negotiations - Chile should be forced to start negotiations to grant Bolivia's disputed right of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's beloved and indigenous president, who is engaged in a tough race for re-election next year, has high hopes for Saturday's ruling.
He claimed in late August: "We are very close to the Pacific Ocean".
But many commentators are on the belief that the color of the court's vote will not fall on Bolivia's face and the situation will change.
The UN body, which is based in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction over the Chilean dispute and has announced that it will have no influence on the talks.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean international rights activist, said that the ICJ's decision, issued only six months after the last round of hearings, shows that the Lihevalya case was not.
And without considering the promotion of Bolivia's goal, the challenges of the last four years have left it in the background.
The issue of access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian state in a disproportionate manner.
The violent morality of the Morales has undermined Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talks, but the continuation of talks after this meeting will be rather difficult.
The two countries have not sent an ambassador to each other's capitals since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, denied the allegation that the court's decision process had been expedited.
He said: "Monday is a unique opportunity for Bolivia to begin a new phase of relations with Chile and end the 139-year conflict over dual interests.
Calzadilla also denied and dismissed the allegation that Morales, who is almost certainly one of Latin America's most beloved presidents, used the maritime issue as a political ploy.
He also said: "Bolivia will not give up its right of access to the Aramean Ocean (Pacific).
The decision is an opportunity to overcome the problems of the past.
North Korea has said it cannot withdraw its nuclear weapons without a reliability guarantee from the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has announced that his country will not give up its nuclear weapons without consulting Washington.
Ri Yong Ho spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the US to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit in preparation for the summit.
These remarks come in a context where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be keen to activate nuclear barrier diplomacy after more than three months since meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
He said that the belief that the boycott and US sanctions on the Korean War would lead to the surrender of North Korea, "is the reason why the Korean War is ending".
Washington has approved the statement in connection with North Korea's notable nuclear disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump have called for a second summit.
But the fact that Pyongyang has abandoned its nuclear arsenal, which it considers a guarantee of its security, has been widely suspected.
Pompeo is hopeful that he will travel to Pyongyang next month to brief Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Show presents its latest collection on the nearby main street.
If you want to expand your collection of kumis or hide from Tave entirely, don't go far.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne have been focusing on some of the biggest and most unusual items associated with the SS19 collection, which has been a source of excitement for Paris Fashion Week.
The photo of the abnormal dolls was posted on Instagram and these designers showed their amazing hands on the doll.
Valentino's white version was a large, goat-colored necklace decorated with a pear-shaped light that covered the model's head.
Other personal items we can make include a Warm-Up, a Magic-Cum, and even a Pineapple, but these are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also showed off his bizarre Halloween masks.
Many of the colored masks were with distant eyelets and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than female figures.
One of the products was a submerged sleeping bag filled with air and a cone of a white crystal.
And you'd be lucky to win the long list of fashion if you could.
Fashion watchers predict that a few coloured kumbang will be seen crossing the streets near you.
The huge sums were revealed after the design of 'La Bomba'. 'La Bomba' was a simple two-foot-long panati which was not seen on anyone's head, not even Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult-like label behind this useless, social media-inspired meme was another product that took the spotlight, a simple, almost-in-the-moment model with floodgates.
The burnt-out Raffia bag, whose flavor was embellished with Raffia and consisted of a thin leather handle, was one of the winning products of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The designer, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big bags and medical bags in the streets next summer, and considering the fact that designers have made such a remarkable impact, it's difficult to meet the demand for large devices".
John Edward: Acquiring language skills is a must for global citizens.
Independent schools in Skåle (Scotland) have a strong and successful track record in achieving academic achievement, and this process was continued in 2018 with the publication of outstanding exam results, which were reinforced by individual and group achievements in Arts, Music and other social initiatives.
With over 30000 pupils in Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strives to provide the best possible services to pupils, parents and parents.
Independent schools are committed to preparing their students for higher and technical education, entering the labour market and achieving a valuable position in the global community.
We as a part of education that has the ability to plan and implement a comprehensive curriculum, understand that modern languages are almost as much a topic of interest and a very popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to people in a language they understand, your words will enter their minds".
If you speak to them in their language, your words will reach their hearts
This reminder reminds us that to achieve peace and trust with people in other countries, it is not enough to use only English.
The results of recent examinations show that the languages with the highest level of acceptance in independent schools are at the top of the rankings.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages scored A-levels in the Gellek Baş.
Data for 74 SCIS independent schools show that 72% of students achieved a "Greatly Good" A in Mandarin, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
These results show that independent schools in Scotland know foreign language as a basic skill that children and teachers will definitely need in the future.
Currently, language as a subject has a place as STEM (science, technology, engineering and memory) subjects in the curriculum of independent schools and other centers.
The results of a 2014 UK Labour and Employment Commission survey showed that in 17 per cent of cases, lack of language proficiency was the reason for the labour force's efforts to gain access to the labour market.
Language skills have thus become significantly important in preparing young people for entry into the job market.
By strengthening the link between new career opportunities and linguistic expertise, this expertise is gaining importance in the globalized world.
Without the recognition of the human professional path, the learning of a second language will be known in the future as a precise mastery and expertise up to the age of maturity.
Multilingual people with the ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will be the pioneers of this process.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of the respondents were not sufficiently proficient in a foreign language to be able to converse with foreigners and only 15% could speak French.
Therefore, the specialization in language education is very important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially the languages of developed economies, allows children to acquire a more accurate education in the future.
In Scotland, a variety of languages are taught in each school.
A number of schools have focused on modern Classical languages and some are learning languages that will be more important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your background, independent schools teach a variety of languages and have a staff of experts in this field.
Independent schools in Skåle are committed to providing a suitable educational environment for the preparation of pupils and equipping them with the necessary skills to succeed, in line with the needs of the future.
We cannot ignore the fact that in the current world of work and on a global scale, language skills are and will be important for the future of this country and this issue should be considered in the educational process.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "International Competition Passports".
Independent schools will continue to deliver these services and take into account the diversity and development of English language youth.
It's the right time.
John Edward is the director of the Independent Schools Council in Scotland.
LeBron makes his first appearance for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The anticipation of fans waiting for LeBron James' first draft pick in the Los Angeles Lakers draft has almost doubled.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take the field in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his first preparation on the field is not yet clear.
Walton told the official website that the delay will be more than one and less than 48 minutes.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James had a limited run and only minutes to go on the field.
After the first few days of this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"For preparation, I don't need pre-season competitions at this stage of my life", he said.
YouTube channel, during Trump's election campaign in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins part of his campaign campaign from Thursday evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five election campaigns Trump has identified during the coming week, which will be held at a number of pro-choice locations in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump is keen to back his party's position in the upcoming midterm elections, as the party risks gaining control of Congress in November, according to the November Republican caucus.
What time is Trump's election campaign in West Virginia and how can we watch it online and offline?
The Trump election campaign in West Virginia is scheduled to air at 7 PM ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018 Eastern Time.
You can watch Trump's election campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
According to reports, Trump is considering nominating Bert Kavanah to the Supreme Court of the country, despite the fact that he was charged with sex offender registry violations and the Senate has delayed the investigation by the FBI.
But the primary purpose of the election campaign is to help Republicans win votes in the November primary, which was met with some controversy.
According to Reuters, Trump's campaign has therefore announced that five re-election attempts are planned for next week to "give more power to the volunteers and supporters of this party, as the Republicans are willing to maintain their majority vote in the Senate and House".
A Trump campaign spokeswoman who declined to be named told Reuters: "Controlling Congress is so important to Trump's agenda that the president can go to any province he wants to speak and we have a busy election season ahead of us".
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the election, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Stadium in Winnipeg, "may draw some supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be reported by the Pittsburgh media".
Saturday marks Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, the same state where Trump received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morris, who has fallen behind in the race.
According to Reuters, Simon Hader, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said: "The president's self-imposed move to help Mauritius get votes is not a good sign for him".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the necessary courage and lives up to expectations by qualifying for Sunday's individual competition
After three individual games, Saturday's four-man roster is the same as it needs this Ryder Cup season.
The Pendulum and Swing movement is a fully developed sporting concept, but it is something that the athlete has to fully believe in and will not forget any time in such competitions.
What is their current situation with these complaints?
Corden Spit, who finished with a backspin today, said: "They were ahead with six laps and now this average is four laps, so in my opinion we can consider this as a bit of a delivery handicap".
Europe, however, is the owner of some of the tops and is four tops ahead, with a total of twelve points.
Spit says that although the Americans are quick to get into the idea of the cubran and have the opportunity to cubran, it is not like Spit and Castin Tomas did it and played together all day and won three of the four titles.
For example, Spit is a good sleeper in the Tee to green movement and is lip-deep.
The cheering fans' applause was more intense than ever during his run and reached its peak when he performed a basic Putt move and when he and Tomas won two more titles and continued to compete for the All Square status.
Putt's run of 15 wins was met with a similar level of excitement, as the team failed to reach the confidence that the US team had.
Spit said: "It is enough to be a competitor and not to lose".
This is something that all these players have at the moment.
The reason for the dispute is the acquisition of 18 assets.
The only players to win more titles than Spit and Tomas in the two days of the event were Francesco Molinari and Tammy Flint Wood, and this event is the most recent Ryder Cup event.
The wonderful and beloved coast of Europe is in a four-four position and never fails.
The Malivians were unable to get the Baghi coup on Saturday afternoon, but they did not get the Baghi coup on Saturday morning and on Monday morning, which occurred at 9 a.m.
The competition and the type of energy both of them have seen in the game, as well as the increased crowd, will likely be the players who will play on Sunday and at the end of this round of competition at the Le Golf National ground, there will be no more favourite players than Billy Fleetwood and Molinari to be the reason for the European victory.
They choose to work simultaneously on a variety of different tasks.
Although the size of the Europeans will soon be a big deal.
Watson's father and Webby Simercio Garcia hosted the morning show, where Garcia played alongside Alex Noren.
A Baguio and two Ducati derbies have sent nine Spanish and Swedish first-class batsmen into a pitch they can no longer get out of.
Even though it's Sunday, there's no one left to save you from that fate.
Quad and quad games are notable for the interaction between team members, the types of tips they give, the types of tips they don't give, and the type of player styrategy that varies cyclically.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made a significant progress in the final day, but these four-man competitions also show that the Azmeristan team has the version to beat, something that even some of the spectators had doubts about.
Europe leads 10-6 on Ryder Cup final day
The results of the quadruple and quadruple events, which are 10-6 on the European stage, will see Europe with a good result ahead of the United States on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Cota Tamí Flintwod and the two-time defending champions Francesco Molinari lead the Le Golf Nationbal with four points, with two wins against Tiger Woods.
Toman Bjorn of Team Europe is trying to reclaim a cap that she lost two years ago at the Hazeltine U.S. Women's Open, where she is now ahead of her American counterpart in the women's quadruple sculls, with a 3-1 overall lead.
The Americans did better in the quadruple sculls, winning two races, but they failed to advance past the podium.
The women's team needs eight points from 12 individual events on Sunday to stay in the competition.
Fleetwood is the first European to score four consecutive points, in a situation where he and Molisnaris, whose team is known as the Mollywood Group, have the chance to win four points from their four primary tournaments in the history of the Ryder Cup.
They beat Wods and Patrick in the quarterfinals, and then went on to beat Wods and the American teaser Brayson Dohkambo with a better score and 4&5.
Wods, who had performed well in two races on Saturday, showed his ability, but still managed to finish 19 of his 29 races in the quadruple and fours and seven consecutive races.
Casin Rose, who was suffering from a back injury for the four-day race, finished fourth in the race to Henry Stenson and with the result of 1&2 beat Dustin Canson and Brooks Cup as the first and third place finishers.
Europe did not have its best day at the Southwest Paris Games, however.
Corden Spit and Castin Tomas, who won three major championships, earned the most points for the Americans, with two points on Saturday.
They were looking to beat Jon Ram and Yan Polter from Spain by a close 1&2 in a quarterfinal and then to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy in the quarterfinal by 3&4, in a situation where they had lost their opening two points.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup has a team managed to attempt a four-point lead in the individual competition and make a Campak, although the opposing team, Forik, wants a win to stay in the competition.
After being placed in the second tier for the second day in a row, the enemy's attack on Sunday was in a way that shows they will be overwhelmed.
North Korea says it will not dissolve in any way without trust and in any way alone
North Korea's foreign minister told Ny on Saturday that the boycott has created mistrust in the United States and that there is no way in the current situation that the country would give up its atomic weapons in a single state of emergency.
Ri Yong Ho announced at the UN General Assembly this year that North Korea had made "good deeds to demonstrate its goodwill" over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, clearing nuclear test sites, and pledging to not expand nuclear weapons and technology.
"We do not see any appropriate response from the US side", he said.
"Without the existence of trust with Azmeristan, there will be no misguidance in ensuring our national security and in such a situation, there is no possibility that we will first unilaterally lay down our arms".
In a context where Mr. Ri repeats North Korea's well-known gains in Washington's resistance to the phase-by-phase approach to denuclearization, a strategy whereby it was decided that North Korea would gain some rewards by removing appropriate sanctions, his statement clearly shows that his country does not support the idea of a single-step process of disarmament, which has been going on since then.
Ri concludes with a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 January, in which Kim pledged to "marry the nuclear leaders of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump pledged to provide security for North Korea.
North Korea has officially ended the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang will give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has almost given up on demands to lift the boycott of North Korea.
Rhee said: "The United States insists that North Korea first "goes to the point of denuclearization" and raises the level of pressure by imposing boycotts to enable it to achieve its goals through denuclearization and even to oppose the "Demonstration of the End of Evil".
This concept of boycotts as a reason to put our feet on the ground is the raw imagination of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the boycott trend is causing our sense of distrust to grow.
Mr. Ri did not comment on his country's agenda for the Kim-Trump summit, which the US president announced at the UN meeting that would be held early next week.
Speaking on the three meetings between Kim and Min Jae-in in the past five months, the minister said: "If the issue of resolving the nuclear dispute were in the hands of the United States, South Korea, the issue of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this level".
However, Ri's speech was markedly different from last year's, when he was named to the UN General Assembly, where "Mr. President Trump" described Kim as a "fighter-taker" with his tough speeches, and said that an attack on the US with North Korean missiles is not far off.
Last year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in denuclearization, but said more efforts would have to be made and the embargo would remain in place until North Korea was completely eliminated.
Trump said Wednesday that there is a time frame for this and went on: "It doesn't matter if it's two years, three years, five months".
China and Russia think that the Security Council will give Pyongyang some credit for its efforts.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the Security Council's embargoes must be maintained with all its might until the unchecked measures are fully implemented.
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously imposed a number of embargoes on South Korea to block its financial supply of its Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the U.N. building and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times so far, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said good progress had been made in the talks, but just hours later, North Korea condemned him, saying he had "cancer-like desires".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that if the U.S. fulfills its "requirements", it would become a nuclear weapons manufacturing facility as well as a nuclear weapons manufacturing facility.
He said Kim told him: "The demands" they are seeking, the fulfillment of Trump's security promises in Singapore and efforts to normalize relations between the two countries.
Harvard students teach a class on sleep.
A new class for all students is being offered this year at Harvard University that will focus on sleep deprivation to combat the unhealthy tendency of students to drink coffee at night to stay awake and study.
According to the university's new research, students studying at the best universities in the world have no idea about self-defense.
Charles Zaysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a consultant at Brigham and Women's Hospital, co-sponsored the course and says it is the first to be used in the United States.
He came up with the idea of this course after a discussion on the impact of poverty.
"At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said: 'Why are you saying these things now that I am graduating from university?'"
Zaysler told DW in an interview with Telegraf: "The girl told me that nobody has ever told her anything about the importance of sleep that is so strange.
This class, which is being offered for the first time this year, provides children with information on the effects of sleep on physical activity, as well as the improvement of physical activity.
Paul Barira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior clinical psychologist at the university's health services division, said the university wants to introduce the course after providing students with a sleep-related week-long sleep gap.
This one-hour course includes a number of team activities.
In one section, the photograph features a student room where students are looking at cups, curtains, sports soles and books and in the other section, the effect of caffeine and light on the wab is discussed and how this sports fitness falls under the influence of sleep deprivation as well as the importance of having a good balance for relaxation.
In another section, some information is shared with participants about how lack of sleep in the long term can lead to an increase in heart attacks, brain tumors and cancer.
A map of the university with tramway icons in the background gives participants a chance to reflect on their day's programs
Prof. Zaysler added: "We know that this course will not have a lasting effect on students.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the terrible effects of the virus on the human body".
He said that there is still a culture of curtsy in attracting people who stay awake all night, adding that modern technologies and the pressure on students, which means their sleep level is reduced, is increasing like a cough every day.
He said that affirmation about the satisfaction of excessive sleep and its healing should be a secret weapon for students in the fight against stress, boredom and hunger - this work even leads to the prevention of fatigue, the absence of fat in the brain and the feeling of hunger all the time.
A 19-year-old California student named Raymond So, who studies physical and chemical engineering, helped Prof. Zaysler create this course and spent the past year at Harvard on the subject.
He said that this course opened his eyes and he has given a separate course for the university.
It is hoped that in the next step, all high school students will be asked to take a similar research program before participating in the competition center.
Prof. Zaysler recommends that students should set an alarm mode for going to rest and also for alertness and be aware of the effects of "blue light" from electronic distractions as well as LED lights.
Liverpool 0-1 Rencerz: Lake Menga led by Cerardenttek
The Rangers once again missed a home game, as goal scorer Dali Menga caused the team to split with Steven Cerard, who was again defeated 1-0 at Livingston.
The team was on course to celebrate its first promotion since its most recent promotion in February with a 4-1 win over St. Huhanston, but the Grey Halt side lost to rivals Leeds Harts by eight points for the second time in 18 games.
Menga scored for his team just seven points before the end of the first half and the Ranger team failed to match.
While the Rencers are now in sixth place with this result, Livingston have moved to third place and only after Haybernians due to the low number of goals.
Now, new strikes are waiting for Rencerz, who was injured by an object hit by spectators and treated by doctors at the end of the game.
Cerard made eight substitutions in the Betferd Cup semi-final against Ayre.
Halt, on the other hand, went into the field with a 11 man batting line-up that had scored a point against Harts last week, and he should be very happy that his team can challenge their opponents with the practice.
The Ranger players occupied most of the field, but Livingston was mostly in possession of the ball.
They were able to score in the second half of the game, where Menga was quickly relieved of injury, Skat Pitmen sent by the goalkeeper Alen Mekgergor, but this midfielder missed the good opportunity and threw the ball out.
The free-kick, sent by Kigan Vakobz to Kurg Halket, was thrown by another defender, Alain Kîtgo, to another goal.
The Rangers took control of the game at home, but it was apparent that in the last 30 minutes of the game they had more than enough confidence in their game.
Alferdo Morloz maintained his belief that he was penalised in the last 15 overs for his draw with Steven Lals, but match referee Steven Tamson confirmed that he was not penalised.
Rangerz only sent two shots into the first half, but former Ibraki midfielder Liyas Kelli was just out of the game with Lazala Kolibaly's goal and Ovey Ocarea's goal.
The 34-point goal was scored against the game table, but no one denies that they deserved the win.
Rencerz again lost with a pass to Jacobz and a shot.
Skat Arfield failed to react quickly and Declan Galager passed the ball from Skat Rabinson and easily passed the ball to Menga, who scored easily.
Cerard switched between the two halves and Collibaly traded for Ryan Kent, and the effect of this change on the game was good. Morillos had a good start, but Colli, with his good pace, got off the ball and sent the ball out.
However, Liverpool sent their fans into a frenzy with their game with the ball removed, and Lithgow and Halket were in for a hard-fought battle.
The Halt players could have increased their lead against the other team at the end of the game, but Mekgugur fought well and threw the corner ball before it reached Jacobz.
Renchers' replacement, Guln Middleton, claimed he was penalised again at the end of the game, but the referee rejected Tamson's claim.
Salnema: The creator of the Gayger number
And now a page from the anniversary of the birth of the first: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, on a day like this, ...the day that the future German physician Johannes Wilhelm Hans Gayger was born.
Gayger developed a method for identifying and measuring the level of radioactivity, a method that eventually became an instrument called the Gayger Number.
The Gayger number has since become one of the most popular and beloved scientific instruments in its field, as seen in the 1950 film The Bells of Koronado, which compared Gavin's knowledge of the game to that of Racerz and Owens:
Man: For God's sake, what is it?
Racerz: This is the Gayger number, used to identify radioactive substances like uranium.
When you wear this headset, you can hear the sound of an atomic impact caused by the radioactive properties of minerals.
Evanz: Say, the current situation is revolutionary.
Hans Kayger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device he had made still lives on.
New cancer vaccine could show the way to identify problematic cells in the body's immune system
The new vaccine has the potential to teach your immune system to recognize and differentiate cells.
A new vaccine has been developed that can identify problem cells as a treatment option
This method involves removing immune system cells from the body of a patient who is being alerted in a laboratory.
In the gut these cells can detect proteins that are found in many cancers and can be absorbed into the gut into the urine.
A vaccine has shown good results in patients with lung cancer.
This vaccine, which teaches the identification of problematic cells in the immune system, was used in a female patient and, at 18 months, her cancer of the pancreas was cured.
This method extracts proteins from the patient and alerts the laboratory to identify proteins associated with various cancers called 2HERs and in the laboratory these proteins are incorporated into the target.
Professor Gi Berzofsky, from the U.S. Pension Center in Besda, Maryland, said: "Our research shows that a good vaccine variant is in the pipeline.
Professor Gi Berzofsky also said: 2HER causes an increase in the number of types of cancer, especially of the brain, spleen, lung and colon.
A similar method has been used to capture immune cells from the patient's body and to train the method of identifying cancer cells in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared in the crowd after participating in the Saturday night live show on SNL with a trumpet-themed crowd.
This one didn't have a good result
Kanye West was teased on Saturday night's SNL live after he praised President Trump for his 2020 re-election bid.
After presenting her third song on the show, Ghost Town, and in which she specifically addressed Trump supporters with the line Make America Great, she was criticized and repeatedly endorsed Trump.
He said: "Sometimes when I talk to a photographer, they say: 'How do you like Trump, is he racist?'
If I were a racist critic, I would leave the United States immediately.
SNL's show began with a comedy show with Met Demon, in which Hollywood star Bert Kawana was confronted by a Senate Judiciary Committee for alleged sexual harassment by Christian Belsi Ford.
Though this video was not released, the images of Kanye West by comedian Kiris Rak were shared on social media.
It is unclear whether Rak intended to intimidate Kanye West with this video.
West also shared his complaint with interviews and said he was abused behind the scenes at his kumbar.
I made them cry behind the camera.
They said they would not go out in the sand.
I forced them!
According to the Washington Examiner, he said: "They also told me that I would be disrespectful".
West continued: "He said again, 'You want to know what disrespect is?' he said, 'I'm going to throw the Superman ball over my head again, because you can't tell me what to do.'
You should try this.
According to reports, his comments led to more intimidating interviews and embarrassing members of SNL's backstage crew, one of whom said: "A deep silence fell on those in the studio".
West was on the Aryana Grande show when his ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
Kanye West has been interviewed many times for his song I Love It, which featured the Perrier Bottle.
West was appointed by Candice Terner, president of the conservative organization TPUSA, who tweeted: "Presentation from someone who is very self-centered: Thank you for standing up to ignorant people.
But host Karen Hunter tweeted a talk show where WrestleMania showed exactly what it is, which is amazing.
He said: "But I love not to let anyone, who follows a big ideology that is harmful to my society, get a hand out by buying music or music or supporting the art of someone.
He is free.
Just like us.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that she would be changing her name and that she would now be officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and is in the process of being identified with a scene also known as Yaf Dedi or P Diddi.
Snop Dag, former rapper also known as Snoop Lion and also as the former motto of Prince's music, changed his name as a symbol and has since been known as Prince.
Shooting at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with manslaughter after a man was stabbed in a Belfast restaurant on Monday.
Police said the incident took place in Balki Hakamor.
The accused is scheduled to appear in the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the public prosecutor's office.
Keith Harington plays the Tac and Text game in the "Memorandum of Understanding"
We know Keith Harington as Can Snow in the fantasy, violent and medieval television series "Crown and Text".
But the 31-year-old actress has come out against the "Male Hero" stereotype, saying that such roles in cinema and television make younger Laiks feel that they must act aggressively to respect them.
Keith said in an interview with the Sunday Times that his views "have a problem in the workplace" and questioned the way he tackled the issue of Manti Yehri during the #MeToo era.
She, who recently married 31-year-old Lazle Roza, another actress from the series Tac and Text, says she has a strong sense of urgency to resolve the issue.
He said: "I feel strongly now that we have been happy with the issue of Marathi in our workplace".
What has he taught us from men in the growing situation about the problem we are seeing now?"
Keith is based on the belief that television is to some extent responsible for the rise of the Jehri Menorah, with its portrayal of overly masculine personalities.
He added: "What are the things of fear and behavior and what are the things of teaching?
What is being observed on television and in the streets that makes young men feel that they should definitely learn this part of masculinity?
In my opinion, this is one of the biggest questions of our time  How do we change that?
Because the job of a young man is a difficult and problematic job.
He also stated in the interview that after the end of the series Game of Thrones and Text in the summer of this year, he will not play in any of the future series in the future and after the episodes of this series, and said in this regard: "My work with horses and mares is over".
Keith will star in the new version of Sam Shepard's "The Wild West" from November, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a DJ.
The actor recently revealed that his wife, Lezli, is the best thing that the series Game of Thrones and Text has ever done for him.
"I saw my wife in this series; Bes gave me this series my family and my future life", he said.
Rose played the role of Ingrid in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, which was inspired by the character of Kit, or Snow.
They married in June 2018 at Lizlie's home in Skåland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
According to the Chinese government, the number of Chinese living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
Health and medical officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are infected with HIV.
Around 40,000 new chapters were announced in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new chapters are made through the transmission of the respective communications, a change that is due next year.
Normally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the transmission of blood vessels and veins.
But Chinese health and medicine officials said at a conference in Yan'an province that the number of people infected with HIV has reached zero.
Despite this, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by more than 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse in communities with gender-based views has become a serious problem in China.
Homosexuality has not been criminalized in China since 1997, in a situation where it is said that discrimination against people with racist views of gender is a known issue.
According to the researchers, due to the conservative values of this country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men (women) end up marrying women.
Many of the cases of transmission are due to unwanted sexual contact in these communities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make HIV treatments available to the public as part of efforts to combat the epidemic.
Maxine Waters denied the disclosure of the Republican senators' data by one of her staff, describing it as a "dangerous circumstance" and a "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Rep. Maxim Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of his employees had made personal information about three Republican U.S. senators available on Wikipedia or the lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat noted that such allegations are being made by "extreme rightists" and websites.
Watres tweeted: "Lies, lies and still be treated with hate".
According to reports, the information released consisted of the home address and phone number of the two U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Yota.
The petition was made available online on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill and at a hearing on a miscarriage of justice case involving the sexual abuse allegations of Burt Guwana, the Supreme Court's top appeal judge.
The revelation came almost immediately after Kavanaugh asked the three senators questions.
According to the report by the proxy sites Gateway Pundit and Redstate, the IP address that reveals the source of the post was linked to Waters's website, and Hill reports that one of Waters' employees published the information.
Waters added: "These baseless allegations are completely false and untrue.
The person who contacted my personnel  whose identity, personal information and safety were endangered by these fraudulent and dishonest allegations  is in no way responsible for the release of these information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false and a lie.
Waters's prosecution quickly came under fire on the Internet; one of them was by former White House spokesman Arie Fleischer.
Filisher wrote: "This denial is out of anger.
It shows that he (Waters) has no moral character as a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, there is no reason to be angry.
It can't be easy.
The demands of the claimants cannot be questioned.
He should be calm and self-controlled.
Filisher's reaction to Waters's ruling appears to be in line with Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who appeared to be a bit of a "slippery slope" according to critics at Thursday's meeting.
Omar Navarro, another Kymarkandida candidate who is keen to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his views.
He said: "If it is true, it is a big issue.
Waters said in a statement that his office had "informed relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies" about these allegations of fraud and deceit.
He added: "We will ensure that the perpetrators will be brought to justice, and will be held accountable for their disruptive and dangerous actions against my personnel".
A scene from the film Johnny English Vedigere, The Wicked Witch of the West, Rowan Atkinson
The move to follow Brexit-related scenes in new UK-related films has been widely criticized, and the action-comedy film "Johnny English Vedigere" is one of them.
Can such a powerful product and a perfect example of our childhood be an opportunity to travel abroad?
However, Johnny English would not be satisfied with his sharp eyes and plastic grandeur, readying to perform for the second time in a production  in a way that shows above all that he is a great comic creation project for non-English and animation communities.
Yet it is the same mysterious secret memory that, despite its bizarre claims about the modern world, is a component of Clouseau, Mr Bean and the man who sat behind the piano at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics and played a single note in the song "The Wicked Witch of the West".
This character is also based on the premise of an international and guest stuntman who played a fellow Atkinson in a Barclaycard TV commercial.
One Kelli  has two good Kellies in this latest JE movie.
I was fascinated by the neck that Johnny English had on when he was riding a helicopter in a medieval-style suit and the sound of his sand letters.
Atkinson's character is prominent in physical comedy, but the film's comic writing is not strong and it looks very bad, especially since comedy is now one of the elements of "classic" cinematic titles like 007 and Memories of Nemumkin.
The characters used in the film are more for children, not adults, and I think Johnny English's headless heads are not as cute or powerful as Atkinson's silent films as Bean.
The constant anaesthetic is that the UK is facing a major problem.
A spy who once attacked a top-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all the British agents working on it, which caused the terror of the agents on the job.
This is the latest for a prime minister who has been a handsome and under-pressured person and is afraid of a major disaster because she is not liked politically: Emma Thompson does a good job in a semi-regular role from Teresa-May, but has little dialogue to show for it.
His intelligence advisers tell him that he should return to work his former spies, because of the confusion of the identity of active spies.
And it means returning to Johnny English himself, who is now the school superintendent in a handsome gym, but in a non-conventional way, teaches how to perform a non-conventional operation.
Johnny English flees to Whitehall to attend a press conference and reunites with "Baw".
Baw now has a wife and children who work with a submarine commander, a powerful role that seems to defeat Vicki Pepperdine's abilities to some extent.
Batman and Robin, who have always been delighted with the secret maid service, return to the stage and face Olga Kurylenko in the role of the beautiful and charming Ophelia Bulletova.
In this case, the Prime Minister is dangerously duped by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their remarkable adventure. The kings drink up waiters and set fire to a French restaurant. They pull off a massive event to sneak into Volta's luxury apartment. And English tries to reach the back of Volta's house with his device and causes a huge riot.
Of course, all efforts have been made for the final scene, but despite the beauty and violence, the whole film is influenced by childish elements.
A medium product.
And like all the other Johnny English movies, I never got the idea. Couldn't the British episode give Rowan Atkinson a role where his talent is just unseen?
Labour refused to create a programme to provide 4 working days to Englishmen and pay them 5 days' wages
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party wants to introduce a radical programme whereby Englishmen will work four days a week and receive a five-day salary.
According to reports, the party is demanding that company executives pay their employees the money collected by artificial intelligence (AI) by extending a day off for employees.
The employees will be able to work three days a week, but their salaries will remain the same.
According to the sources, the decision will be based on the constitution of the economic assembly and the non-party programs based on the interests of workers by the country.
The 4-day work week was also approved by the Consultative Union Congress as a method to achieve the benefits of workers from a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "It is expected that a meeting will be held before the end of the year to review this policy.
This work does not come to fruition overnight, but the idea of a 4-day workweek is a proposal aimed at economic easing for workers and also in line with the party's pre-emptive general strategy.
The Green Party has proposed a four-day workweek since its 2017 election campaign.
However, this idea is not currently supported by all the members of the Workers' Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: "Four days a week is not a party policy and is not guaranteed by the party.
John McDonnell, speaking at the Labour Party conference last week, gave his views on the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. John McDonnell has said he wants to take power away from "the bad directors" and "the users" in the securities companies.
His plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to get their full stake, as the Labour government could seize their shares for fraud.
He also outlined the programs that would include the transfer of workers to corporate bodies and public property capital, so that 10% of the salary of NGOs would be given to employees, who would receive annual income of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes that the FBI's involvement in the Kavanaugh case could change their approach
The FBI investigation into alleged crimes against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the court's decision on his nomination by at least a week, and it raises questions about whether the findings of the FBI investigation could lead to the resignation of several senators.
In an interview with 60 July. aired Sunday, host Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could send anything that would cause the two to change their minds.
Kennedy's hand was more open than his friend from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "Yes, of course".
When I went to the meeting, I said I was going to talk to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the allegations against him were made, I called him and asked him if he had done it or not.
He was confident, tough and quiet.
So, it's like saying that Graham's opinion is not going to change.
"I have given my verdict on Brett Kavanaugh, the accusation is against him.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Graham met Christine Blasey Ford and said: 'Brett is vehemently denying it.'
And they can't verify anything Ford says.
That's 36 years.
I don't see this new version.
What is the World Solidarity Day and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York is hosting the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event where a group of the music world's biggest stars perform.
The World Citizens' Festival, which is in its seventh year, is hosted by tens of thousands of people in the huge Central Park lobby, where participants will watch the performances of singers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes and at the same time inform the public about the main goal of the festival, which is to eliminate violence by the 2030s.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began its work in 2012, is part of the Global Citizenship Project, an international group with the goal of combating hunger through the number of people actively working against hunger.
To get a free ticket to the festival (if they don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), concertgoers must use a number of tools, including sending e-mails to world leaders, creating contacts, or any other authoritative means to increase information about their goal of reducing poverty.
But what has been the progress of global citizens in the 12 years to the target?
Is the idea of giving free concert tickets to attendees a good idea to convince leaders to end hunger or is it another gift of "Killitism"?
Since 2011, the World Citizenship Movement says more than 19 million "Hawks" have been recorded by its supporters for various purposes.
The festival says these efforts have led world leaders to donate more than $37 billion by 2030 to help more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group reported that 390 contracts and documents were signed as a result of their work, and at least $10 billion had already been invested.
According to the group, 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by their work.
Some major deals include "food power", a partnership between investors and managers committed to "helping children reach their full potential" that pledges to provide $35 million in Rwanda to fight hunger in that country, after receiving 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
Tracey Ullman, the head of "food power", said at a live concert in London in mid-2018: "We can overcome this social hunger relief with the support of the UK government, supporters, national governments and global citizens like you.
The group also reported that after 5,000 attempts to appeal to the UK for maternal and child health, the government announced that it would provide capital for the start of the Power of Food project, which will affect 5 million women and children.
In response to a frequently asked question "what makes you think you can eliminate the violent numbers?"
The global citizen said: "We have a long road ahead of us, we will sometimes fall short.
But we will win, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are strong.
Some of the stars who will perform at the festival this year include: Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and hosts Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
UN can use its naval power to block Russian energy exports
Ryan Zinke, the U.N. secretary of interior, said that Washington could use its naval power to prevent Russia's access to energy markets, particularly in the Middle East, if necessary.
Zinke accused Russia of interfering in the Syrian government, particularly as it is engaged in calling for a legal state  a pretext for searching for new energy markets.
According to the sources, he said: "I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they are acting as an intermediary in the energy trade negotiations there, just like Eastern Europe.
And, according to the authorities, there are ways to get it.
"America is the god of that capability, with our naval forces, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to take it, to make sure their energy doesn't go to the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to attendees at the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-partisan group that describes itself as ``, the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He continued by discussing Washington's approach to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively one.
"The economic burden on Iran and Russia, more or less, is rising and replacing fossil fuels, he said, while pointing to Russia as a `` country whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration is reportedly on a mission to boost its natural gas and liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, making Russia's successor a cheaper option for Europe.
To achieve this, Trump State officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to get Germany to exit the ``neguncaw`` pipeline project that has enslaved Berlin to Moscow".
Moscow has long been stuck on the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is a purely economic project, with plans to expand the existing pipeline to 110 billion square meters.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to the project is solely for financial hackers and is an example of unwarranted competition.
"I believe we are on a path to the consensus that energy cannot be a tool of the revolution and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has been met with a backlash from Germany, which has repeated its commitment to the project.
The German Investment Federation (BDI), the governing body of investment in Germany, has called on the US to stay out of Europe's energy policy and bilateral ties between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, president of the German Energy Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "When a third country enters our energy supply, I face a big problem".
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take a hard line on the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will take a hard look at the presidential election after the midterm elections.
Warren agreed to participate at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and rebuild our broken state with a woman at the top".
"After November 6, I will take a hard line on the presidential election".
Warren stood up to President Donald Trump in the city hall and said the country is heading in the right direction.
"I am very unhappy with what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren tweeted on Monday that "we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a report released on Thursday showed that most of Waarren`'s supporters do not think he will participate in the 2020 auction.
According to a Boston Globe/Suffolk University Political Research Center survey, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not participate.
Two-thirds of voters supported such an election.
The poll showed support for Devak Patrick, the former governor, with 38 percent in favour of a possible election and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats contesting the 2020 election included former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, he will make his official decision in January.
Sarah Palin is playing PTSD ̋ya Track at the Donald Trump show
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Saturday night.
"As for my son's head, what happened to him, I miss other families who suffer the effects of PTSD, and some of the injuries our soldiers have to go home", he told the audience at the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsaya, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the ``phil in the room and said about his son and the soldiers of the war ``they are going back a little different, they are going back, they are going back without knowing if there is a rank of respect for their comrades in the army and the air force and every other member of the military to give the country".
According to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla ` Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla `, Alaska, on Monday, and charged with aggravated assault on a woman, reporting domestic violence and the presence of tiving, and simultaneous assault.
18 states, D.C. support the new asylum policy
Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have supported the legal obstacle to the new U.S. policy of not granting asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or civil unrest.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia prepared a brief friendly letter to the court on Monday in Washington that supports the policy of barring homosexuality.
The names of the plaintiffs in Grace v. The Civil Liberties Union of America's August ruling against federal policy were not disclosed.
She says her boyfriend `` and sons of gang members abused her but U.S. authorities denied her asylum request July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The Dadsitan who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to the majority of asylum seekers in the US, as people subjected to exclusion and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Columbia District Attorney, said in a statement on Monday that the new policy "does not apply to international, state and federal law for decades".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be prepared in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates that principle.
The judges in the ruling said the policy of denying immigrants entry was damaging to the U.S. economy, saying they should "make them entrepreneurs and ``power employers".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June allowed immigration judges to no longer admit victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
Sessions said in his June 11 statement on the policy that ``Penableness is for those who may leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
Asylum has never been able to alleviate all the problems that people face every day in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu'un as victims in the struggle for survival rise
For the Bermayi, the situation was becoming more and more dangerous.
"Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who brought her son to the gathering center in the devastated city of Palu`, says ``the situation is very complicated.
"Every minute, ambulances are arriving.

Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a spinal cord injury, are being treated at the Palu` Army Hospital, where they are still recovering from the ongoing earthquake.
He was also reportedly in the fifth floor of the hotel where he lives with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
Harris told The Associated Press that ``ez was trapped in the ruins of the tower, adding that his family was in town for a while.
"I heard my wife's voice asking for help, then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of violence with ``ads
A week after a four-page Chinese newspaper ad in this daily U.S.-China trade situation, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using media outlets to create a riot.
US President Donald Trump last week pointed to the monetary value of the Des Moines Register - the largest Chinese newspaper in the state of Lowa ̋ - accusing China of trying to win the US congressional elections on Nov. 6, but China denies it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election is a sign that US officials told Reuters it is a new process to turn Washington on China.
While it is common for foreign states to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are now in a failed trade war that raises the level of each other's exports.
Chinese and US experts say China's price-stimulus at the start of the trade war was aimed at foreigners in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime advocate in Iwa`, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing` has hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Branstad wrote in a commentary on the Des Moines Register `a on Sunday that China `` now undervalues the violence it used to feed our press with propaganda ads".
Branstad wrote that China is breaking with the American tradition of free speech and free press through its publicist propaganda, and he has been featured in the Des Moines Register for financial advertising.
He wrote ``Reportedly, in press releases within Beijing's streets, one cannot see the freedom of opposing voices and there is no real voice from the hopeless views that the Chinese people can speak about the direction of China's economy, because the media is under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that `` one of China's most important newspapers had rejected his offer to publish his article, but did not say which newspaper.
Republicans warn, women voters are being pushed away by Kavanaugh's fall ahead of midterm elections
As many senior Republicans stand up and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against multiple allegations of sexual harassment, investigators warn they will see her story, especially of women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sensitivities around this have increased significantly, and the Republicans have already indicated they are willing to go ahead with a vote.
Grant TcheReeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill ` for an article on Saturday that they can't go back on `` anymore.
Reeher said it is likely the last time Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will be subjected to an FBI investigation to calm the rest of the electorate.
According to the Washington, D.C. newspaper, Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior activist and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Saturday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday  they will forget tomorrow and November ``".
On Monday morning, protesters called ``November and simultaneously marched through the Senate chamber because Republicans were not in control of the Judiciary Committee to come forward despite the testimony of DR. Kavanaug, Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Stu Rothenberg, a pro-democracy political researcher, told the news site, "Democratic collapse and disorder will not be on the map".
"People say it's more than ever; it's true.
But it can't be more, especially women voters in the cities and young people, 18 to 29 years old, who don't like the president, and the poor people don't vote".
A day before Ford's public testimony about her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, prosecutors said there would be a response if the Republicans went ahead with the approval.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at a rally last week, "This has become the GOP's dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb".
Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats elect, told the news channel that `` is not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether or not Kavanaugh should take office, but also about the path that Republicans have taken and how they registered along the way.
However, it seems that Americans to a degree do not feel comfortable with Kavanaugh and Ford's testimony, preferring the latter.
A new report from YouGov shows 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony is either true or false, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh is true or false.
In contrast, 38% of respondents said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
The Guardian reported that, following Flake's move, the FBI is now investigating the identities of Ford and at least one suspect, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford swore on the Senate Judiciary Committee floor last week that she would resign from Kavanaugh when she became ill at 17.
Ramirez claims to have been a Supreme Court nominee at a party he attended as a Yale student in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet that will go through Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, embarks on a career that has the potential to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the tech legend, a company that develops Berners-Lee's open source Soild platform.
Solid provides people with the choice of where to go and where to find information.
Berners-Lee said in an exclusive interview with Fast Company that the idea behind Inrupt`` is "global domination``".
"We have to do it now", he said.
"This is a historic moment".
An app that uses Solid` technology allows people to create their own individual online data pools or PODs.
It can contain lists, job lists, calendars, music books, and other individual and specialized tools.
They are like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all on one search and sync.
What is unique about online individual data storage is that it is generally the user who decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, Inrupt's vision is to bring the company's resources, vision and capabilities to the world and make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform, some online employees who are willing to work on the project, and a team of volunteer coders.
This week, tech developers working around the world can create their own unique apps with the tools available on the website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to ``Facebook and Google to make a general change in the event that their business model breaks down overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission".
In a post on Medium` published on Saturday, Berners-Lee said that Inrupt`'s ``work is to create a business energy and ecosystem that helps unite and maintain the new web view of Solid`".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential figure in the net neutrality debate.
Until the launch of Inrupt`, Berners-Lee will remain as the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, and the Free Foundations and Data Institute.
"I'm very excited about this other web series", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross was celebrated
The only Anglican clergyman to have been awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War was commemorated in his hometown on his 100th birthday.
Sergeant Bernard Vann was awarded the medal for his actions on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a typist killed him four days later and he was never given the highest decoration in the British Army without knowing it.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two nephews at Rushden Square, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, the grandson of his grandson, said the stone clearly represents ``` and was unveiled 100 years after his grandfather's award ceremony.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 General Vann passed his troops from the canal de Saint-Quentin "with heavy fire and under the fire of the guns of the field and mechanized tiving".
He then attacked the line and with a large ```-shaped gun he pulled his line forward and grabbed three people with hand tiving and a pair of scissors.
Serheng Vann was killed by a German keyboardist on 4 October 1918, exactly one month before the battle.
Michael Vann, 72, says his father's job was something I couldn't live with but something that is unimportant".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also ran a shooting range for the Brentwood Imperial Youth Group.
Michael Vann said he "sometimes celebrates the ceremony by attending a `` and asking ``nirx and the status of a hero is confirmed by the fact that many people hold this status
MMA fans stayed up all night at Bellator 206 to watch Peppa Pig
Do this, you stay up all night watching Bellator 206 but they don't let you watch.
The documentary from San Jose featured 13 fights, six of them on the main map and one night live in England on Channel 5.
On Saturday morning Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face off, stunning the audience in England when the show was switched to Peppa Pig.
Some people were wary of the shelling even after the early hours of the morning.
A Twitter user called the switch to a children's card "a little sick".
Dave Schwart, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, said that the state law at 6 a.m. does not allow for this content, so they put in a children's program.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Scott Coker, the CEO of Bellator, said he was keen to work on timing of programmes that would be available to UK audiences in the future.
Coker said "I think that the discs should be, I think they can work on the discs.
``L It's Sunday morning there and we won't be able to use our time until Sunday, Monday is their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it was changed, there was a lot of writing going on and on, and it wasn't all pretty.
We are trying to make it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But they were not, it was the state's problem.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to five fighters instead of six as we normally do and we're going to try to get the supporters and we're going to get the fans.
It was a bad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'feels small' about being born
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he was big and felt inferior to everyone because of his gender  but this motivated him to become a champion.
This 24-year-old says he goes to high school without knowing that not everyone is like him".
He has been featured on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, in a gay rights talk show where he discusses the issue of gay rights, which is "given to others".
He also said that when he became a father, he no longer heard about the Olympic cut.
Kirsty Young, the long-time regular presenter of the show, has been out of work for several months due to illness.
Daley, who hosted Laverne's first program, said she felt "less important than others" because "the social stigma of boys and girls was not acceptable".
"Until today, those feelings of being less, and feeling different, have been the real things that have empowered me to be able to stand on my own", he said.
He said he wanted to believe that he was ``tiştek`` so that everyone would not be disappointed when serencam they entered his genus.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a top LGBT campaigner and her image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year is not seen as a threat to citizenship by more countries.
He said he spoke because he felt he could live without noise and with clarity and wanted to give ``space `` to others".
The three-time World Champion is a man named Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker, whom he met in 2013 - ``ez surprised to receive ``".
Daley married another Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him last year, but he said they were older and never had a problem.
"When you get so deep at this age, you're like, '`` - he went back to his first Olympics at 14 and when his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was hard to find someone in the same situation and experience so much harmony and responsibility.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said `` everything about him has changed.
"If you ask me last year, I only wanted to win a gold medal.
"You know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist".
His son was named after his father, who died of cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was if tickets for the 2012 London Olympics were still available  because he liked to be on the front lines.
He said, "I can't tell him you can't participate in the first row.
He said, ``I held his hand because he was not breathing anymore and by then he was not breathing anymore and he was dead and I knew he was not breakable.
Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics the following year and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was my life's dream", he said, "I was in the crowd at an Olympic Games.
He became the first ever singer to sing "Shanaz" from Heather Small, who had voiced it in the lead-up to the Olympics and still gives it a thumbs up.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson sits on the Ryder Cup racket from the couch on Saturday
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record on Sunday when competing in his 47th Ryder Cup, but he must get back in shape to avoid a scratch.
Mickelson, on the duet session for his 12th album, was interrupted by Jim Furyk for a four-song and four-song set.
Instead of being in the center of the work, which is what he's always done in America, this five-time major leaguer has halved his time as an executive and hopes to work with the touch of a button that keeps him busy.
Never in a direct driver's test in his career, the 48-year-old has no Armenian advantage at the fierce Le Golf National, where long-distance competition punishes stunts daily.
And if the competition isn't as tough as it should be, Mickelson will be the one to beat British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who has agreed with Tommy Fleetwodd to be the all-star this week.
If the Americans are four points below their 12th straight game start, a warm start, Mickelson's defense could be very effective.
Furyk said he has faith in his person, he can't say much.
Furyk said `` I generally understand my role today, give me a pat on the back and put your hand inside me and it will be ready tomorrow.
"He is very self-confident.
He is very famous and he has done a lot for these teams, last and this week.
My goal was not to play those two games.
I was hoping too much, but it came along and that's the way we thought it would go.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
She will not be able to determine the end of a Ryder Cup career that will never be matched by the highest individual points total.
Mickelson has 18 walks, 20 strikeouts and seven half-centuries, although Furyk said his presence brought important things to the team.
He explained, ``ew is good, people like him are few, he is a good boy, he is very good for the team room.
"I think young players loved to go with him, also this week, which was nice to see.
He brought more than just playing".
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, could be out of the top ten soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant amount of one-day titles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into tough ones.
The Dane made their debut in the 1997 competition at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros won a five-point lead against the USA but only finished in the final with their unbeaten lead with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
Bjorn, pictured, said after seeing Class`a win 5-3 in 2018 yesterday and yesterday to reach 10-6 at Le Golf National ``Don't forget we played a great game at Valderrama`, at Brookline` it was a great game, we won, and at Valderrama` we lost, but only.
So history will show me and everyone in that team will know I wasn't perfect.
You usually go to the game in the morning.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This bridge is not there until you reach the top.
We have a goal, and that is to try and win this award, and we're focused on that.
I always say, I'm focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are so well informed about what's on the other side  the best players in the world".
Bjorn, who watched his players compete in a golf tournament, said: "I'll never be the first in this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is the individual's work that comes before, and it's a different thing to do.
It's nice to be there with a partner when things are good, but you're there alone, and then you go for your golfing skills.
It's the same message that you need to get to the players, get the best tomorrow.
Now, a person leaves his partner behind and he has to go and get the best result".
In the lead up to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to outplay his opponents Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three of the four points.
Furyk has made great comebacks at both of those goals, being part of the frontline team in Brooklyn before the strike as Europe withdrew from the Medina Miracle.
He said in response to the remark of Ben Krenshaw, the 1999 captain who had cut his players before the day, "I remember every word of her cursing.
``We have 12 important mornings, but people love to fool themselves for it's a quick start like you saw in Brookline `, like in Medina `.
When it is solitary, it deposits a lot of moisture on the middle ear.
We define ourselves according to that line and we make these boys feel, you know, we try to make a miracle tomorrow".
Thomas gave up his stake in the next game and faced Rory Mcllroy on the high scores, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half of the series.
Bjorn said of his only options, "I went with this group of boys in this line because I think it gives all the paths in front of it.
Germany's new warship launched from behind
Local media reported that the newest ship of the German Navy was due to replace the World War II-era battleships in 2014, but will not be until next year due to faulty systems and cost overruns.
According to Die Zeit, the military spokesman's son, the preparation of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new brand Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until mid-2019.
The ship was due to be delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the cost of the ship's construction was delayed due to the high cost of the ship.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be the successors to the Bremen-class vessels.
It is understood that they will have a heavy artillery piece, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some covert technology, such as radar, low-level signals and voice.
Other important features are long-term staying - being able to stay away from major ports for up to two years.
Die Zeit reports, however, that the delay in the launching of the warships - which it says will allow Germany to build naval forces - will be delayed when they are operational.
The F125 torpedo boat made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to build the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy will return a ship to its builder after it is built.
There was little information about the reason for her return, but German media pointed out serious weaknesses in flexibility and consistency, which would have been useless if the war had been fought.
Flexibility gaps were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships would fall to a group of 120 sailors  or half the population on the old Bremen `a.
In addition, it was found that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its usefulness and limits the ability of the Navy to carry out future missions.
The 7000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the German battleships of World War II.
In addition to the flexibility errors, the overall cost of the project  as well as the training of the staff  also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1bn ($3.6bn) - up from €2.2bn.
The problems with the newest ship are becoming increasingly important as the current warnings weaken Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German defence committee in the parliament, approved the Navy's withdrawal because of the warships' "serious" attacks.
He said the problem has been prolonged over time, as the old ships are no longer useful but the ships are not ready to be laid down.
He said uneasily that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships could reach the navy.
National Trust ears the life of balchymakers
New research is being conducted in the Scottish Highlands to determine whether balsamic oaks in the area are used to feed the soil.
It is hoped that this achievement will clarify the repair of aircraft and prepare for future defense activities.
This study by scholars at the National Trust for Scotland will include soprano duet as well as the ballad compositions of Daubenton at the Inverewe Basement in Wester Ross`.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the ground to showcase the activities of balchymics during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct follow-up tests with hand-examiners.
The expert voice of all the volumes will confirm the number of basaltic calls and what kind of calls are made.
A map of the population and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed and comprehensive picture of their well-being.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advocate for NTS, hopes the results will determine which of the surrounding valleys are important to balsamic species and what kind of fish use them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work of managing the environment such as making males and keeping males well-groomed for balsamic and other related species.
The population of baldy bears in Scotland and southern England has declined significantly over the last century.
He sees the damage from construction and development that is destroying the mine site.
Wind turbines and lighting can be hazardous, as well as paper planes and certain chemicals that can cause damage to buildings and house-to-house attacks.
The Balchemi are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal neural tube structure, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to neural tube occlusion.
They use a sophisticated technique of sound positioning to create obstacles in the flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the protection of 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the reservoir, takes the balsamics very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly conduct research, stay overnight and occasionally go to archaeology.
The institution has recently created the first private balsamarium in the Threave` lands in Dumfries and Galloway`, home to eight of the ten balsamic estates in Scotland.
David Thompson, the land manager, says it's the most beautiful place for them.
He said ``li here in Threave` is a very good area for balconyers ``.
"There are old buildings, lots of old trees and all good mining sites.
But there are many things about balcony workers that are still unknown, so the work we are doing here and in other areas will help them learn more about their needs".
He stressed the importance of checking the balsamics before carrying out the hajj in these properties, as the consumption of these buildings, which are their night shelters, could lead to the deaths of 400 balsamics, men and youth, eliminating the color of a population in general.
It is illegal to protect and kill, torture or maim the Balchemiq or to take their homes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Trust for the Protection of Birds, urges people to be seriously involved.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about balchemy and for many species we do not know how people look at them".
Ronaldo denies abuse while lawyers prepare to open case in German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied the accusations of sexual harassment, saying people want to take his name and put it above the line.
His lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit in the German magazine Der Spiegel alleging that he published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was convicted of sexually assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported that Idia later paid him $375,000 to remain silent until the trial.
Ronaldo, 33, described the report as "a sex-eating ```" in a live video on his 142 million-follower Instagram a few hours after the announcement.
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
The five times Berende said the Golden Ball, what they said today is news sexte``.
"They want to go up in my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
The actors jokingly said, `` I'm a lucky man and everything is fine ``.
According to Reuters, the allegations are being prosecuted in Der Spiegel, which has called them "unproven allegations of suspicion in the private sphere".
Christian Schert, the lawyer, says the actress will pursue a mental health `` with a currency equivalent to the severity of the disability in what is likely to be one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years".
The alleged encounter took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County Circuit Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the players' room after meeting in a nightclub, where he will remain from now on.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo dropped to her feet after the incident and told her he ``99% a good boy `` and he ``1% doesn't care".
The documents show Ronaldo admitted he was not there, but he was in a deal.
Mayorga also alleges that he went to the police station and took pictures of his wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court because he was afraid of ``tolhiling `` and was reluctant to be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to reinstate the settlement because the court hearing has given her a mental breakdown.
Ronaldo was already on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the summer transfer window, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: England will lose its `hetahetae poşman be`` language
Greg Clark, Brexit Trade Secretary, says England will be `` until it loses its status as the world's leading post-Brexit economist.
He added that this ``negation ` means that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if the UK joins the EU without agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
Mr. Clark said, ``We are dealing with a comparison.
The Japanese economist said the impact of border delays on a no-deal Brexit would lead to some job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were sold to the EU.
Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Burnaston executive, said, "My view is that if the UK leaves the EU quickly in March, we will see production in our factories stop.
Other British Arabs are also fearful of leaving the EU without a deal on border crossings, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, will close its small factory near Oxford about a month after Brexit.
The main uncertainty surrounding the commentary by the pundits is that it creates supply chain risks in the face of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is based on a `` timeline, with some parts ordered every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for those cars.
If England joins the EU without agreement on 29 March, there will be a border dispute, which could lead to delays and shortcomings.
Toyota said it could not keep the cars in its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers programme for future relations with the EU is "so far removed from those border checks".
"We have a deal with a deal", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "We want the best deal that allows us to not only win now but also when we have the opportunity.
"The testimonies from not only Toyota but also from other carmakers are that we need to be able to do what the supply chain group has been doing so well".
Toyota cannot say how long production will last, but warns that in the long run, rising prices will reduce factory competitiveness and reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for almost 24 years and is the head of the Unit Unit at the factory, said his unit members are very ungrateful: "My experience is that when this job is gone, don't come back.
"We have a very ambitious and well-defined program for our future relations with the EU", a state spokesman said.
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein is "dead in the water"
The White House said Sunday that Donald Trump's highly anticipated meeting with Rod Rosenstein, the attorney general's representative, could be postponed another week because of the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein sees a page in the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, Trump's Russia-Caliphate ties, and the president's possible violation of justice.
Whether or not Trump brings in a prosecutor, and thus threatens Mueller's independence, will generate months of Washington gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the installation of a recording device for recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president from office under Article 25.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, where reports suggested he was planning to resign.
Earlier, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Tuesday.
Trump said he would prefer not to expel Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which accused Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, of sexual misconduct.
On Tuesday, Trump gave the FBI a week to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press release, came to Fox News on Sunday.
On the question of Rosenstein's case, she said: "Because there was no day, it could be this week, and because of everything that is happening in the High Court, it will be postponed for another week.
But we will always love to stay brothers.
Some reporters will say this to questions: Sanders has been in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to the lack of attention from TV reporters, adding: "I agree that they are paying attention".
She then announced that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
She said: "The president asks and answers more questions than any previous president, without any documentation: "We are not looking at those numbers".
She said that there will be press conferences, but if the opportunity arises, it would be better for the press to ask the president directly.
We're trying to increase it, and you've seen it increase in recent weeks, and they're going to replace the press conference when they can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly gets into trouble when he leaves the White House, either at a public meeting or at press conferences with distinguished guests.
Private press conferences are very rare.
This week in New York, the president will show why, in front of a group of reporters, he is free and fair.
The Ministry of Health has written to EU staff working at NHS Scotland amid post-Brexit fears.
The Ministry of Health has written to EU staff working at NHS Scotland, recommending the country stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP wrote a letter in less than six months to wait until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to pay the costs of the emergency claims for EU nationals working in its shift services.
"In the summer, talks between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have been ongoing, this autumn will lead to decisions on the ban.
But the UK is also preparing for a possible unlikely scenario.
I know this must be a very uncomfortable time for you.
That's why I want to repeat now how much I respect the privacy of every staff member, of every nationality.
Partners from the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that make healthcare work strong and good, and benefit patients and our society.
Scotland is 100% your home and we would love for you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie was released after a head injury
According to Tennessee's Mike Organ, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Bears' backline was in a rush after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Sunday, following a head injury.
Tennessee State Superintendent Rod Reed told reporters that the injuries occurred shortly before the halftime of the crash.
Reed said, "He came to a line and almost there, he fell".
The medical staff and medical staff put Abercrombie on the stretcher and gave him oxygen to the neckline to prevent further damage.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is under surveillance at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details about the type/type of injury and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine whether King had been injured.
Abercrombie, a red sofomorph, is in his first season in Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He had five hits before leaving the game on Sunday, all of which came in the season at 18.
Foreigners will pay more tax on the land when they buy property in England
When foreign operations are bought with the extra money that was available under the Tory's new program for helping the poor, they will pay a higher tax on the bribe.
This move will ineffectively undermine Corbyn's work to win the votes of the youth
More tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in England
Ministry of Treasury hopes to reach 120 million pounds per year to help the poor
Theresa May today announced that foreigners have been forced to pay a higher tax on land when buying property in England with the money she had decided to use to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's rise to popularity with calls for a more inclusive and targeted mass vote.
More fines will be imposed on those individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, using the extra money to strengthen the State's work against cartons.
The surplus  which is above the current interest rate, plus higher levels announced two years ago on the second house and buy-to-let  could be as high as three percent.
The Ministry of Treasury expects to reach 120 million pounds annually.
An estimated 13 per cent of London's renovated properties were owned by people who do not live in England, adding value and risking a first-time move into the property market.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become spiritual hotspots due to the increasing number of foreigners who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes almost weeks after Boris Johnson called for the land tax to be cut so young people could have their first home.
He accused large construction companies of ... owning land that is too expensive to own but not use, and urged May to invest in rental properties to "make the UK's housing bubble go away".
Mr Corbyn has announced a briefing on the protest movement, including a crackdown on the police and attempts to remove innocent people.
He also wants to give more power to the barbarians to build new houses.
"I said I would dedicate my presidency to the dream of British journalism, that life should be better for every new generation", said May.
And that's what we're going to do with our own floating marketplace.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it is not true that for people who do not live in England, nor do they have businesses in England, renting a home is as easy as it is for the hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of having a home is far from reality, and the shame of having cartons is far from reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to travel to Scotland
Jack Ross, the Sunderland boss, says his ultimate goal is to manage Scotland at some point.
Scot (Skat), 42, is delighted with the challenge of upgrading the North-East club, which is currently in League One, three points above, in third place.
After losing to St Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last season, he moved to Lightning Stadium (Royal).
I wanted to play for my country.
Ross told BBC Scotland: "I got a B and it was.
When I was a kid, I spent a lot of time with my dad in Hampden, Scotland, and he's always been something I've been drawn to.
But that opportunity will only be there if I succeed in running the club.
Prior to Ross, he was the manager of Sunderland with Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he has never felt intimidated in tracking the pace at such a big club, having previously turned down starts from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Is it possible for me to win this now, to bring this club back to the Premier League?"
He said: "Because of the institution and the capabilities of this club, it is undoubtedly Premier League.
"It's not an easy task to get her there, but if I get to the club, I'll probably see myself as the only winner.
Ross has been in charge for just three years, following a spell as deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell at Hearts' reserve team.
He then helped Alloa to a third place finish, and St Mirren moved from the entry-level to the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than he did in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled Alloa's acceptance of responsibility: It is likely to be a real dispute.
I really thought directing was just for me, much more than acting.
It seems strange because I did well, I lived a good life outside of it, and I achieved good things.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things to take on a weekly basis.
I still feel the stress and the pressure of his work but it's very well managed.
I always wanted to be a director and I still do, so I feel good all my adult life.

Research shows the best time for a daycare is 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has hit hard pubs in the UK but has hit restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars were found to be 2.7 percent more expensive in July, while revenues at restaurants were down 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, CGA's marketing director, who set the record, said: "The continuing trend and participation from England's longer wait at the World Cup followed a June pattern, when pubs were 2.8 per cent, in addition to restaurants being more crowded.
The 1.8 percent restaurant occupancy in June was worse than in July.
Drinks pubs and bars were more heavily-populated than restaurants.
Food pubs also fell on hard times, although the same was true for restaurant managers.
Apparently people just liked to go out for drinks.
While the sale of drinks by pubs and bars fell to 6.6 percent for the month, the sale of food fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, researcher at RSM's beauty and hospitality department, said: "This result is a continuation of the path we have been following since the end of April.
Climate and the impact of major social or sporting events are the main factors when it comes to exporting.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are struggling, despite a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales over current spending.
The hot and long summer could not have come at a better time for the people who are hungry and will tell whether the better wind we saw in August will give us a much needed opportunity".
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, as well as new venues, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in outbound travel.
Coffer Peach Tracker's pre-sales tracking for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses data from 47 active groups with a turnover of over £9 billion, and is the UK's pre-sales tracker.

Research shows that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have hidden social media accounts that they don't reveal to parents or teachers.
Survey of 20,000 secondary school students shows increase in "Institute sex" pages
News has increased fears of sexual content being distributed
Twenty percent of students said they have an account of their "main" day care provider
One-fifth of children - some as young as 11 - create media accounts and do not show them to their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows a rapid increase in "sex-related" pages  responding to Instagram sharing.
The news has increased fears of sexual content being distributed.
Twenty percent of students said they use the cleaned sereke account to show to midwives, but they also have their own individual accounts.
A mother who found a news feed on her 13-year-old daughter's secret website encourages others to "touch me".
The study, by Digital Information England and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC), found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitting to having an individual account.
"It's alarming that so many news outlets are creating online places that parents and teachers can't access", HMC President Mike Buchanan said.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the heroes" at the Skåland Heroes' Square
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of the Skotlands Championship as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is the most famous skating hero in Skåle and chairman, Ian Beattie sees this as a great opportunity for those who know the sport to benefit from her extensive experience over the past decade at international level.
"Eilidh is well respected throughout Skatlend and England and the championship community and we are confident that the championship of Skatlend will benefit greatly by bringing her on the pitch", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I love working as the voice of the heroes and hope to be a real coach and do a good job of running the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won all four of her Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, is now a regular commentator for the BBC, after being unable to walk after the Islamic State attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I suffered a coup.
I can't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover.
It was a tough job but I was fine, I learned to walk and now I'm a professional walker!
Thanks for the messages!"
Single moms' ads compare to make-up and have sparked online debate
A company that makes single skins with a commercial that compares them to milk and cheese makers has sparked controversy.
To debut what has been called "the most famous single mother doll", consumer technology company Elvie released a video that takes advantage of the ad to show the freedom that the new single mother doll gives mothers.
The four real mothers are on a full set of tracks for a track that includes the following lyrics: "Yes, I'm sweating, but you don't see the baby" and "If you don't get it, then you don't get it".
She continues: "Give milk, give milk, I give milk to children, give milk, give milk, I give milk to my children".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
The video, which has been viewed more than 77,000 times and has received hundreds of views, has received mixed reactions from commentators, many of whom say it "explains the evolution" of the plot.
"It is a very difficult decision to bring a product to the market.
One wrote: "They need to be fat and be able to give milk, only their babies are stolen a few days after the holiday".

Another said: "It is painful for the mother and child in a humorous way.
But why don't they use it for ads about the specials for mothers who have their own children?"
Another person said: "A shot outside the range".
Others defended the ad, with one woman saying it was "happy".
"I think this is a good idea.
If I still run out of milk, I'll help.
They made me feel like a monster.
Advertising is a bit boring, but I understand what it's for.
One wrote, "This is a rare product.
Another said: "It's a nice ad for mothers who give milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like 'chickens'
This is not an advertisement that praises or comments on the pre-eminence of the spite".
At the end of the video, the group of women say they have been wearing the tags and dancing.
The idea behind this campaign is to make women feel like they are made.
But Elvie Pump is quiet, her wires and pipes don't fit well into the sink, allowing women to walk easily, have children, and even go out at the same time.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and ECD at Dayik Center said: "Elvie Pump is such a good program that it should be launched very well and worthwhile.
By drawing a connection between women and the arts, we want to define the unique sword and its obstacles, and at the same time relate the uncertain sense of freedom that this sword carries.
This isn't the first time Elvie Pump has been a headline performer.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's head with this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are now camping at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased despite monthly border crossings, partly due to the Trump administration's rhetoric and violent policies that have led to children being shunned by supporters.
Many of the supporters have already been displaced by illegal immigration, and have risked their potential in the country by leaving to seek a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to pay their dues, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Mattew Albence, a senior official in the Immigration and Refugee Resettlement Department, told Congress that the agency had detained dozens of people who had requested support for children who were homeless.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees were not serving their sentences.
"About 80 percent of the people who are supporters or family members of supporters are here illegally, and most of them have no criminal ties.
Mr. Albence said "we are continuing to track them".
According to the officials, the children were not allowed to work until the new laws were passed, which meant that some of them would be in court for up to a month, not 60 days, as was the norm.
Many will be present via videoconference, not drinking, to present their legal status claim to an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for the court will be immediately prosecuted.
According to the staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months, the more children are kept under surveillance, the more we are likely to be uncomfortable, which can lead to forced labor or flight.
Al-Giran said that the number of cases of malnutrition has increased in places like Tornillo, where children are not well fed due to the symptoms.
They stressed that the killing of children in the campsite without adequate time for emotional preparation or the encouragement of friends could give a blow to those who are already infected.
Syria says US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" must withdraw
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muelim also urged the UN General Assembly to return Syrian refugees to the country, which is now in its eighth year of civil war.
Muelim, who is also deputy foreign minister, said foreign forces illegally entered Syria under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "there will be a response".
He told the Assembly: "They should leave without delay and without any regrets.
Muelim insisted that the fight against terrorism is becoming a stalemate in Syria, where 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus would "continue the holy war until the seizure of all Syrian territory" from terrorist groups and all illegal activities.
The US has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and fighting Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country.
Muelim said the situation for returning refugees was good, and condemned Western countries for "inciting fear of persecution" that has caused refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian institutions to facilitate their return", he said.
"It is a matter that should be politicised in a purely humanitarian way".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not contribute to the Syrian crisis until there is a political settlement between Assad and his opponents.
UN diplomats say the recent negotiations between Russia and Turkey to create a stability pact in the strongest opposition position in Idlib have created an opportunity for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish conflict has been overshadowed by a major offensive by Syrian forces backed by Russia, which has captured the country's three million-strong population.
But Muelim recalled that the agreement has its dates and hoped that the military action would target the world's militants, including Nusra fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda, who "will be gone".
UN Staff envoy de Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of the new state and opposition committees soon to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muelim gave some conditions for the participation of the Syrian state in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "examination of the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against intervention.
Why Trump will win a second term
With that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election with a victory that, as many liberal views hope, will quickly derail the presidential scandal.
This will be the most unfortunate end for a president!"
As of now, there are no signs of miners being buried.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Lielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, down from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops all ratings with 3.5 million viewers on the evening news headlines.
Neal Baer, the host of the ABC drama "The United States", said, "It's a fire that people are putting on because we don't understand it", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, a great writer of the comedy "Only the Perfect Parts: And Some Contrary Truths About Dixie in the Sons of Modern Hollywood" has another theory.
He recalls driving a car in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she would vote for Trump.
She asked, why?.
"She said, 'Because they're hitting me.'"
There is a sense of aggression in the conflict.

Out of the money box in the bitter midterm elections contest
It is no wonder that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is on the verge of a surge, helped by congressional districts that have two people in need of a seat.
This is Conor Lamb of the Pittsburgh City Council District, a Democrat who won another district in a special election last year.
Lamb is running against fellow Republican candidate Keuth Rothfus, who is currently the former representative for Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which is very similar to the new 17th.
The map was taken after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January allowed the old areas to be illegally mapped with the Republicans' approval.
The 17th new election between the party's main funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC), has been plagued by a campaign funding shortfall.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a special election in March to the 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by a Republican for nearly a decade, and Donald Trump defeated him by 20 points.
Political experts say Democrats will win with a majority.
U.S. strongly blames El Salvador for support from China but backs back
Diplomats recalled that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already formally recognized Beijing, without some backing from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his associates fired the Trump administration.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the latter's decision to not formally recognize Taiwan.
However, sanctions were imposed only on El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 as well as drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cutting household allowances and targeted visa reductions, would result in increased unemployment and homicides in the Central American country.
As the internal negotiations progressed, the North American and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development and a wide-ranging meeting last year, which we saw as a step toward preventing immigration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior state officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, or no more sanctions for El Salvador.
The diplomats said that Vice President Mike Pence is suggesting that he speak at the conference, indicating the state's commitment to the conference.
And three US envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to elaborate on the details of the debate, saying three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, had agreed to discuss the internal inquiries on condition that their names not be disclosed.
Their accounts were confirmed by an unnamed foreign investigator close to the state.
Read the history
Another possible excuse is special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which now has prominent witnesses for the public.
Mueller is investigating whether Trump has colluded with his campaign and attacks on Russia, according to reports.
If Congress changes its mind, Mr. Trump will find himself accountable in that institution, as he prepares to receive votes, and will be represented by a panel of his allies.
There are many ifs, and my guess is not Mr. Trump's fall is 100% - nor his counterparts in Europe.
We can all have options on both sides of the Atlantic to influence how much work will be done.
In 1938, German officers were ready to overthrow Hickler if the West ended up facing him and the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We couldn't, and missed an opportunity to see the next few years of grief.
The course of history converges around the points of instability, and the violent movement of democracy is sooner or later.
Americans are currently experiencing several of these points of instability.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls the framework of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a state of emergency since he reported this document a year ago, he has steadfastly suggested recording the president's vote and this is not appropriate for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is not accurate.
"What if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct, or if, despite credible allegations of sexual assault and unwanted sexual intercourse, the Supreme Court decides to hear the case?"
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm for a Congress that Mr. Trump is accountable for?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But I think we will not break, because of the lesson I learned in Praque.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
He survived, emigrated to the U.S., and, 60 years later, I sent the Sabbath mummies to the winter table with the swastika on it.
With my inheritance, how can I not be concerned about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is ready for Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Tuesday, knowing the victory against Austria, after an effective withdrawal in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the season would give them a strong position to be from Group G of the Europa League.
Injury to midfielder Graham Dorrans prevented him from making his first start of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a distraction for bigger tasks.
"He was a good point for us because Villarreal could take something and get to a point", the 31-year-old said.
"We came into the game thinking we could get something and score a goal.
We could have been disappointed in the end, but overall, the withdrawal was probably a bad result.
He was better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
With Thursday coming, it is another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the previous game, and many people were behind us, I am confident we can go forward and get a positive result.
It was a tough year, with all the things I had to deal with with my injury and the changes at the club but now I feel good about the place.
The group is good and the boys are quick; the teaching is good.
Hopefully, we can move forward now, leave the past behind and be successful".
Women are sleeping because of fear of losing their household income
Although the survey participants had a clear view of immigration, few people in the study discussed it with their families.
Nearly half of those in the National Survey said they discussed the cost of long-term travel with their spouse.
Only 10 percent of them talk about it with their children.
Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationawide, says, "People want a family member to stay with them, but they don't take the steps to talk about it.
We'll start here.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot make a divorce from your family if you don't make your wishes clear in advance.
Work with your sponsor and family to discuss where and how to get immigration, as these options can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your own household broker: Your broker can also be a broker to provide a way to pay those coins.
Your long-term disability home insurance options can be a previous long-term disability insurance policy, a cash life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or be insured with your wealth  as long as you have the money.
Bring your legal documents: Be fair when crossing the border.
Have a healthcare emergency representative monitor your medical emergency and make sure that specialists are in touch with your requests if you are unable to make contact.
Also, for your household chores, seek out a legal representative.
You will trust a chosen person to make financial decisions and be sure if you cannot get your money back.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly mother needs urgent medical attention and is on her way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
They are required to provide a written schedule for the preparation of the meeting.

"What are the conditions?
Who will be your next resident?
The plan will be implemented".

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people are expected to die in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Sunday, officials said.
Welfare officials were unable to get information from the Donggala principality, a region north of Paklu near the center of the 7.5 degree meridian, when they were unable to get in touch.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
These are some of the facts from the Palu and Donggala beaches, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a shallow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was on its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a principality that extends over 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
This principality, an administrative subdivision of a province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi province, especially in Donggala district.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but more so in Morowali province, on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami in 1996 hit the western Donggala and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the Epirus Strait and is experiencing a series of earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia's North Sumatra on Dec. 26, triggering a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: Several powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami and striking the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of South Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands, Sumatra, and a 10-meter tsunami devastated dozens of villages and killed nearly 300.
2016: A shallow earthquake in the Aceh province of Pidie Jaya, devastated the population and left it devastated by the 2004 tsunami.
This time the tsunami struck, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes on the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily displaced thousands of people.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska attorney Sarah Palin and vice presidential candidate, was arrested for the attack.
According to the Alaska State Troops' report on Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and resisting arrest, a complaint on a domestic violence and resisting arrest report.
According to police, when a woman tried to call the police and report sexual offences, he took her phone call.
KTUU reported that Palin is being held in Mat-Su Pretrial Division and is carrying an uninsured $500 document.
According to a report by Tor, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "not guilty".
Palin faces three Drece A felonies, which could carry a sentence of up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He also faces a number of Class B penalties, which can include one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been convicted.
In December 2017, she was convicted of assaulting her father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the attack.
His case is currently pending in the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016, he was convicted of domestic violence, pleaded guilty to domestic violence, and was found to be in possession of a firearm in connection with the incident.
His daughter claimed to have had his wound on her face.
Sarah Palin came under criticism from major groups in 2016 after her son's aggressive recovery was linked to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia tsunami: hundreds killed in the earthquake
384 people died on Sunday after a month of flooding on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The streams and torrents are not in contact and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
They searched for videos on social media and showed the time of the search.
Hundreds of people were at a beach party in Palu, when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal judges are on the back of a very rare death sentence for suspected terrorists in NYC
Federal judges in New York are holding a second death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a death sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly hit a two-lane road using a Home Depot truck at the West Side Registry in Lower Manhattan, violating his license and driving license on Oct.
According to the death penalty motion, which is being prepared in the Southern District of New York, to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "killed eight people and inflicted serious injuries".
According to the court document, the two men are both on death row.
Several weeks after the attack, a grand jury issued a 22-count verdict against Saipov on eight counts of murder for aiding and abetting, which federal prosecutors use as examples in organized crime cases, and aggravated assault and destruction of vehicles.
Dadsitan said the attack was "necessary with precision and precision" and described Saipov's actions as "vicious, cruel and immoral".
The statement said "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was responsible for the injuries, damage and loss of family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years ago, the death penalty was filed in the Southern District of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but serencam was given a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple convicted of spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War and executed two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electronic chain on 19 December 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, was not seen for days and months after the attack.
Police say he told investigators he was happy with his job.
According to the verdict, Saipov told authorities he was motivated to attack his phone after watching ISIS videos.
He also requested that the Daesh flag be flown over his room in the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of rape.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, said he was "clearly not hopeless" about the judge's decision.
"We think the death penalty or the possibility of life imprisonment will only prolong the duration of these trials for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's lawyers had earlier asked the prosecutor not to impose the death sentence.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage has vowed to mobilize the People's Army in a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat from Eurosceptics  because one of Theresa May's representatives suggested she should be in charge of the EU.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, told protesters in Birmingham that England would leave if Mr Frage was Brexit minister.
But the obstacle May faces is to bring together members of her group whose deep-rooted disagreements have led conservative leftists in Europe to hold separate anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The Prime Minister is working on his plan to coordinate the actions of pro- and anti-mining groups in the EU.
He insists he will move forward and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the obstacles and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose one within its package and logic.
Mr Bone told the Quit or Quit protest in Solihull that he wants to distance Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be appointed as a partner and be responsible for the talks with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left now", he said.
The Wellingborough representative added: 'I will stand for Brexit but it is necessary that we keep Chequers away.'
He declared his opposition and said, 'We did not fight the world to be deceived.
We want them to make their own laws in their own country.'
Mr Bone rejected the view that the public had changed their minds since 2016: 'This view that the British people have changed their minds is publicly incorrect.'
Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter who was also at the protest, told reporters: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular for the public, Opposition will not vote, our party and our activists do not like to have their weight on the platform and become a reason for us to be united in the election.
Please break up the Chequers and start listening.'
In a message to May, she said: 'The Prime Minister has a job to do at that time to stand by his words.'
Mr. Farage told the protesters that politicians should be forced to "feel the heat" if they decide to betray the 2016 referendum.
"This is a question of trust between us - the people - and our political China".
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are telling them today 'we will not let you do it.'
In a message to the cheering crowd, he said: 'I want you to feel the truth, feel the truth, feel the truth of our political China that has the heart to betray Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we have an independent England, power, glory".
However, May's supporters in Birmingham stopped in the city before a two-hour march in the city centre.
Some of the Tories' anti-Brexit activists have been disbanded since the group's inception at the end of this week.
Labour's security ally Lord Adonis made a nod to the Muhafizekaran during a party programme at the opening of the conference.
He added, "These are the people who are telling us they can have their IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for border-free confusion, for border-free free trade in Ireland".
He is a perfect fit.
"Nothing is as good as Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to take a serious look at the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will make a serious assessment of the current presidency after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports the Massachusetts Democrat in the upcoming election spoke at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has always been critical of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl in the GOP state, who ran for president in Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He is at the center of this belief, and is poised to become Trump's 2020 rival.
The meeting was her 36th meeting with lawmakers since Trump's presidency at City Hall.
One participant asked him if he was running for president.
Warren said, "When women come to Washington and build our beautiful state, a woman can come from above".
Sims was caught up in LSU's reopening
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said Saturday that LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Monday in a robbery.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of the alleged rape, asking for help to identify the person seen below.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the South Campus campus on Monday.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday that "Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died".
Wayde came to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, had a gun, confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested with ease and is in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 freshman who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton after his team allowed Sebastian Vettel to become world champion
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas was seen as a potential opponent of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team "allowed" a large part of the competition.
From the top, Bottas started well and also threw out Hamilton's break as he defended his position in both first sets, calling on Vettel to attack his opponent.
Vettel started to go into the bushes and forced Hamilton to enter the traffic behind, which caused the steering wheel to crash.
The Mercedes then made a name for itself and came after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a command-by-order job and saw the Ferrari driver leave the pitch empty to risk being thrown out after a late run to protect the third lap.
Max Verstappen started from last place and finished seventh at the end of the first half on his 21st birthday.
He then went on to compete and was forced to retire early to replace Kimi Raikkonen.
Serencam he entered the race in 44th position but could not increase his speed between eighth as Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri was all so good at the weekend and they were a real piece of work.
Hamilton said the team did a good job of winning one by two.
It Was a Brethren's Body Language
President Donald Trump offered his condolences to Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday where she rejected a letter from Christine Blasey accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the committee directly, saying what he had shown in the Senate was "pissed, shipwrecked and distrustful".
He said "one thing that can be frustrating is what is happening in Sena these days, when you see anger, you see people are angry, angry, angry, and unbelieving".
"When people look at the statements and the words of the martyrs and they say oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do that".
Does she miss you?
Dianne Feinstein, have you been tortured?
Remember her answer... you gave her a paper - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I'm not going to.
He didn't let me out".
Well, it stopped for a minute.
He added, in the sense of a senator, "Gelo gave us out...No, we didn't give out".
Details of the charges against Kanaaugh were submitted to Feinstein by Ford in July, and were made public in early September, but Feinstein denied that the disclosure came from her office.
"I'm Dr. Vennhart. The Hill reported on Ford's claims, I didn't release her story.
"She asked me to give her a baby and I gave her a baby as she wanted".
But her denial was apparently not well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you what, it was a really awful body language.
It doesn't have a color, but it's the most amazing body language I've ever seen".
The president, continuing his defense of the Supreme Court representative, who is responsible for the disgraceful sexual abuse of three women, said that the Democrats use these arguments for their own purposes.
"They are determined to use all means to force their hand.
Mediaite reported on the president's son, "You see peace, unrest, they don't care who gets out, who gets to power and control".
League of Legends: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars were comfortable for the Champions League final loss to Belfast Giants with a 5-3 comeback loss at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants, led by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, quickly took the lead with two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought their game level before Dwyer was traded back to the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored two goals for Dundee to secure their promotion, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals.
It was Adam Keefe's third consecutive Women's League title of the season, coming on from behind in Belfast on Sunday night's 2-1 defeat to Dundee.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, as the Giants had worked all three games previously.
Dwyer came on in the fourth minute 3:35 from Kendall MaFaul, with David Rujtheford providing an assist, while Beauvillier scored two more points in the fourth minute.
In what was a difficult opening period, Sullivan led the home side to the game at 13.10 before Matt Marquardt tied the score for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants took the lead in the first half when he scored the second goal late in the first period.
The home side scored and Bouchard scored to put them on the podium with a powerful 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen Dundee win his first end of the season victory in the second season and he ensured his team's fifth-place finish in the final season.
The Giants, who have now won four of five games, are at home for the opening game against Milton Keynes.
Air Traffic Controller Mir, who was in a sedan, said he was safe from the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is seen as a hero after he died and confirmed the plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
After a full moon on the island of Sulawesi on Sunday, a tsunami killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
The area is still under heavy fighting and many people are trapped in the town of Palu.
Although the 21-year-old's companion escaped, he did not find his place in the traffic jam at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airstrip in Palu.
He was in place to ensure the safe landing of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the way at the time.
He then dropped the control button thinking he was drooling.
He later died in hospital.
The decision was blocked by Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority, who has blocked hundreds of flights, ABC Australia reported.
We have prepared helicopters from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be converted into a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached the hospital.
"Our hearts are touched to hear this", he added.
Officials fear the death toll could rise further than the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency has estimated, as the poor conditions in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong have been exacerbated.
"The death toll is still rising because many dead are still in the water and we have not yet evacuated many areas", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
The winds, which reached six meters, caused Palu to make a mass storm on Saturday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are calling every minute.
Clean water is very scarce.
Small shops are being sold everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to get help to the Canfilites quickly but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a disaster, but it could be more dangerous".
Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Saturday and told the country's militants: "I want you to do all the work related to the landing day and night.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by a tsunami in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crashes: Air Niugini now says one person missing in the province after plane crash
The airline, whose plane crashed into a remote island in the Arama Peninsula in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously said all 47 passengers and crew were safely rescued from the crashed plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday evening that it could not count a single male driver.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, the hospital and investigators are trying to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to details about the passenger, including his age and nationality.
Local boats evacuated other passengers and crew after a plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airfield.
The authorities said seven people were taken to hospital on Monday.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all were doing well.
The cause of the crash and the cause of the collision are still unknown.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane entered the area shortly after taking off.
Some witnesses said they thought the plane had crashed on the way to landing.
Bill Jaynes, the American pilot, said the plane was very low.
Jaynes said "it's very good".
Jaynes said he and others managed to reach the emergency doors of the plane he was flying through the water to their bunker.
He said the flight crew was being chased, and he also suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said its nearby crews should build an anchorage with boats that had been armed with bifilite and reach the shore before the plane landed in 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows 111 people have died in PNG's crashes in the past two decades, but none of the Nigerian airline's fatalities were reported.
The story of a woman who was raped in the night
Dadsitan said this Saturday is the tentative trial of a man convicted of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Investigator Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness on the intelligence investigation.
He told the prosecutors that he used hand-held phone records to find the way to Quinton Telis, 29, and Jessica Chambers, 19, the victims, in the night of the murder.
Clarion Ledger reported that Rowlett said he had received local data from several cell phones showing Tellis having sex with Chambers the night of his death, which contradicts his earlier claims.
When the data showed his phone before she said she was with her friend Michael Sanford but was with Chambers, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When asked if Tellis was right to say he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "It's a lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another time, Tellis said she had known him two weeks before her death.
The phone records showed they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text, phone and contact information from her phone.
Hale said "he has saved his life".
The decision is to start the last day of the documentary process on Sunday.
The judge said he was awaiting trial and would then be brought before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?
A hip hop trio is trying to counter the negative perception of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claimed hip hop had moved away from its roots as a political message and social issue.
They want to return to the music and popularize hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common in England see re-emergence artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
And another black person?!
UN searches man and woman for ni-racist post
A New York mother sues a man and a woman for a racist post from a mother who claims she "would have been black someone else".
Women and men deny they are racist, calling the case "money laundering".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was horrified in 2016 when she saw a new baby migrant, Giselle Maurice, turn black on her first day of work.
The first time she wrote to her husband, she wrote "NAAAAAAAAAAA REŞEKE DIN".
However, she sent it to Maurice twice instead of sending it to her husband.
According to the New York Post, Plasco Flaxman "disappeared" after realizing he had been raped, and told Murice that their departing mother, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Maurice received a day's pay and then sent it home as an Uber.
Maurice is now suing for the deaths of a man and a woman, and is seeking up to $350 a day for six months, the job he initially earned without a pension.
"I want to show them, hey, you're not that big".
Women and men who objected to the claim that they were racist, say the criticism of Maurice's work was unreasonable, and could no longer be trusted after the pithy remarks.
"Jina sent him something she didn't want to send.
He is not racist.
Joel Plasco, a man, told the Post, "We are not racist.
"Are you willing to give your child to someone who has wronged you, even if it was by mistake?
Your neighborhood?
What do you say?"
Plasco, who is suing for "abuse", said his wife was two months pregnant, and he is in a very difficult situation".
"Will you give up on such a person?
The banker raised the capital, and the money is not good enough to be made.
While the legal proceedings are ongoing, the public court has quickly condemned the couple on social media, and has confronted them for their reputation and logic.
New letter clarifies Paddington publishing house has no interest in corn
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book's release, commented on her letter: "It's hard to give yourself to someone who you read for the first time and before publication.
It is now very interesting to know what we know about the great Paddington victory".
She said she was excited about her father, who worked as a BBC television presenter before he had the courage to write a children's book by nylon yarn, adding that it was the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books tehl and sweet after his death last year.
She continued that her father calmly anticipated the possible victory and described Paddington as a "very important member of the family".
She said, "He was a very calm man, and he was not a wimp".
"Because Paddington was so real to him, he was almost as good as a child to have: one is famous even though it is not the real thing one does.
I think he looked at the Paddington win in a way.
Despite his passion and his dream, his habit was to focus on eating Paddington".
My daughter was dying and I had to ask for her memory on the phone
When his daughter arrived at the Luis Pasteur Hospital2, doctors tried to revive her but to no avail.
"Nad has repeatedly said he was not prepared to wait.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that he was going to die in two minutes and I was forced to ask for his memory.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her would slowly remove her heart and restore her system.
He had died a while ago and it was all over.
I was forced to just sit there and wait, I know that's obvious.
I couldn't cut, cut or take because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to have her brother".
Serencam, grandmother of Ednan-Laperouse, who was carrying her daughter at the time of her arrest, was among the passengers on board the plane who were unable to return to work.
"No one knew", she said.
"My head was down, almost soft and my hips were curled.
She said yes, but it was during the flight that I realized Nad is innocent.
Eva needed my understanding and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Postcards are being painted by women to prevent suicides on the streets
Two women who lost their lovers to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent a card to the Welsh Assembly with messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Tyler Davis's 13-year-old son was an atheist and committed suicide at the age of 18.
She said, "I don't want other mothers to feel like I'm the same every day".
Banu Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a hopeful cook with a disabled dog.
"Everyone knew who he was.
I always said who was lighting the room".
However, he resigned before his death, because he was "in a dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, committed suicide after his brother's death.
"I'm always looking for something unusual to happen", said Banu Davis.
The Davis Brothers created cards, where people knew there were certain people they could go to and talk to if they were friends.
Do not be silent  it is necessary to speak".
Banu Humphreys, who had been friends with Banu Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old partner shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling like he was falling or being divine, nothing", she said.
"We found out a few days before Christmas that his reputation had changed.
His head was down on Christmas Day when the children opened their presents, he never looked at them, nothing".
She said his death was a big blow to them, but they were forced to mourn: "It caused a rift in the family.
Our house burned down.
But we are all struggling and fighting the situation".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in the hands of an FBI investigation
Mr Flake said on Saturday, "I thought if I could get something like what he wanted to get - a limited amount of research in time, a limited amount of space - we could get a little bit of a gap, adding that he feared the committee would get stuck in a backroom of supporters.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance to do so is due to time.
With only five weeks to go until the midterm elections, November 6, if, as they expect, the Republicans don't work hard, then they will be reluctant to step in their efforts to get the heartthrob to the highest square in the world.
George W. Bush has called Senators, lobbied for the endorsement of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush at the White House, and through him found Ashley, his wife's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report?
The Senate, where Republicans currently have 51 and Democrats 49, will hold a vote.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and nominate him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of people who are divorced in North Korea is declining
A South Korean official said the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, a senior official at South Korea's Ministry of Construction, said 1,127 people were evacuated last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the border controls between North Korea and China and the increasing number of people smuggling are the main obstacles.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements on the matter.
Most of the people who come from the North receive the serenade of South citizenship.
Seoul says 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are travelling through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is more convenient than the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views people who run away more as illegal migrants than refugees and sometimes forcibly returns them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are not technically at war, have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders held talks in Pyongyang on nuclear disarmament.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed extensively on moving to a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho condemned the US embargo for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in these circumstances, there is no way we can undo ourselves", Ri said in an address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi tells Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical, still insists he can't serve on the Supreme Court"
Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, called Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and said he was morally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview with the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman gets into them, they're going to be hysterical", Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's remarks in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has strongly denied allegations of sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were news reporters.
During the opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost staring and his hands and hands were moving as he talked about his family and high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic caucus, calling it "a hate crime" and "a murder of a personality" that left liberal conservatives with a hard-on to defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's remarks prove she cannot serve on the Supreme Court, because it would show she is anti-Democrats.
"I think he's getting drunk on these words and his way of talking about Democrats and Clinton", she said.
Pelosi was harsh when asked if she would resign Kavanaugh if he did, and if the Democrats won a majority in the Mecls.
Pelos said, "I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but he should be tried in the same court.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi insisted that she is a Democrat in the midst of Kavanaugh's controversial case against the Immigration Act or Roe v. Wade, which sees the judge as conservative.
Kavanaugh in his opening remarks avoided questions about whether he would reverse the Supreme Court decisions.
"As long as there is no hysterical person, let him go to court and wait for us to say 'no, he's not doing very well.'"
It takes a woman to use it.
It's a harsh but true criticism, the anger has spread for months and years, and he can't get to it without his hair.
Banu Steinem told me 45 years later, "When we are wise, we cry".
"I don't think he is defenseless, is he?"
She continued, "A woman who was in charge at one place helped me a lot, she said she was crying when it was cold, but she developed a technique where when it was cold, she would say to the person she was walking with, "Range, think about it, I'm crying".
I was smart".
And it took decades.
And I thought, "That's very sweet".
They are to a certain extent round because they are misunderstood from below.
One of my most vivid memories of my early career, in a mostly male office, was getting kind of angry on my own, grabbing a bigger woman by the collar and cutting her wings, and I was a little scared.
"Never let them see your entry", she said.
"They don't know you're a witch.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they're giving themselves to you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a monkey business with a woman and left the competition, Mrs. Schroeder, very uncomfortable, stated that there was no evidence that he could not express his opinion on the presidential election.
She told me 30 years later that "it was not a well-thought-out decision".
"There were seven other candidates in the race, the last thing they needed was someone else.
One person called it "White Berfa and Seven Kinok".
She was collecting money because she was late in the campaign, and vowed not to collect until $2 million, so she didn't compete.
It was a war of conquest.
She realized that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
She asked curiously, "Do you think I'm getting the flu?
When she made her speech and announced she would not campaign, she was so emotional  grateful to those who had supported her, angry at the system that made it difficult to collect money and target voters who were not representatives, and angry at racism  it was her turmoil.
"I was angry", Banou Schroeder recalled, "You think I was angry.
"You were the one who thought to buy Kleenex, my company.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my headstone?
"Is he a witch?"
US-China trade war will be good for Beijing
Experts say the start of the US-China trade war was a fluke, and while the conflict is far from over, an intra-EU war would be long-term advantageous to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump first warned earlier this year about the possibility of imposing tariffs on China's main exports, including soap, steel and aluminum panels.
The most significant upheaval this week was the imposition of new tariffs on about $200 billion (£150 billion) of coal, or taxes on half of all coal imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has held its own every time, with the latest valuation of US bonds of $5 to $6 billion.
China is trying to beat the US, and the world's second-largest economy is far from being able to do so quickly.
Getting to Washington or joining the demands, but publicly denouncing the US, would be very problematic for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Experts say Beijing can play its cards well, and the US trade war scenario could positively back China in the long run by reducing the domestic dependence of the two economies.
Abigail Grace, a research associate at the New American Security Center working on Asia, which is the source of the thinking, says "The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could trigger a crisis in any country is now becoming increasingly dangerous and this is a given.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to return refugees
Syria says it is ready for the willing return of refugees and calls for humanitarian aid to the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid Muelim, speaking at the UN General Assembly, said the situation in his country is improving.
"Today the situation is much better and safer than on the ground because of the war against terrorism", he said.
The state is in the process of restoring the areas destroyed by terrorists to normalise the situation.
All conditions are now in place for the willing return of refugees to the country from which they fled because terrorism and economic exploitation have targeted their daily lives and work.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country and are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muelim said the Syrian regime welcomes assistance for the reconstruction of the destroyed al-Aqsa Mosque.
He said he would not accept conditional aid from the countries that are aiding the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe entered the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating Team USA in the final by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now played six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe were crowned champions when the Danish team Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the American star who worked most of the tournament, threw his shirt in par-3 water on the 16th hole, scoring a goal for Francesco Molinar.
Molinar, the Italian golfer, has been a fixture in all games, becoming one of four players to go 5-0-0 with this score since the tournament's inception in 1979.
Jordan Spieth, an American, lost to Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark in the lower 5th round of the European Championship.
Dustin Johnson, the best player in the world, beat England's Ian Poulter, who could have played in the Ryder Cup final, 2-1 in the final.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, eight-time Ryder Cup winner, was named Europe's leading scorer with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually go, but I can't today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you to Thomas for having me and his trust in me.
I am very happy, so happy to receive the cup again.
"He's in the team", Garcia said, "and I'm happy to be his assistant".
He is the torch bearer for John Ram of his country who defeated the American golf legend 2&1 Tiger Woods in the individual event on Sunday.
"The uncertainty I feel, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Ramzi.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup lead of 13-21-3.
The most impressive feat by one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 titles is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA worked hard on the weekend to find good ways to play with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-ball golf at all tournaments.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, said after a tough performance to his team, "I'm proud of them, they did a good job".
This morning, when we were in Europe, we had time.
We fought.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll put together a plan, I'll work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I am proud of these 12 boys and proud to be their captain.
You should blind your eyes.
We played a game".
Red Tide: Rainfall is declining in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows Red Tide reefs in parts of the Tampa Bay watershed are declining.
According to FWC, peer-to-peer cases in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties are reported as a sign of a decline in poverty.
It is a development that stretches approximately 130 miles from the coastline north of Pinellas to south of Lee.
Some bridges can be used on the 10 miles of Hillsborough Beach, but in some places less so in the past week.
Red Tide found in Pasco canton
Mid-level flooding was reported in the Pemellas County riding last week, further down in Hillsborough County riding, up in Manatee County, up in the mountains there, up in Sarasota County in the back-to-mid-level flooding in Lee County, and down in Collier County.
Breathing difficulties are still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
No respiratory problems have been reported in northwest Florida in recent weeks.
