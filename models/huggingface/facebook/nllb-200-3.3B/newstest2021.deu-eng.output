Biker is quick to react and prevent the worst
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
A motorist overlooks a cyclist
A 44-year-old female driver wanted to turn left on the Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
She overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist with the right of way coming from Nellingen.
In the event of a collision, the hand and foot brake levers will be removed
The biker tried to avoid the car, but he still hit it in the rear.
The swerve caused the Suzuki's hand and foot brake levers to be torn off, and the driver was unable to brake.
In his mind, he steered his motorcycle into the green tire next to the roadway and rolled it off without falling.
Biker suffered leg injury
The motorcyclist was injured in the car and had to be treated in a hospital.
The situation is worsening in the country, with the number of workers affected rising to 174.
After a mass infection of corona in a large vegetable farm in Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are not allowed to leave the farm.
A security team is monitoring the curfew.
A total of 174 harvest workers tested positive for the corona-causing agent Sars-CoV-2 during the routine inspection, the Dingolfing-Landau county administration said on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to prevent further spread, we have to take this step to protect the population", said Werner Bumeder, a CSU councillor.
Seven employees had already been infected at the plant, which led to the serial test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, growing strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot, but the cucumbers are only for drinking glasses.
Mamming is a rural community of some 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the rules on the free movement of goods are complied with.
At the farm, the infected were separated from the non-infected staff, and the site is now surrounded by a perimeter fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition groups accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to check the housing of seasonal workers.
"This can backfire bitterly if such local infections take hold and regional lockdowns have to be ordered", said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director of the Greens.
The SPD is similar: "We have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest workers after the coronavirus outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May", said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"We believe that it is the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions that must be strictly controlled.
Obviously, that didn't happen".
The outbreak was "announced".
Aidenbachstraße underground station: A 19-year-old man falls into the railway bed after a dangerous argument
During a fight between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstrasse metro station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the rail bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, at about 16.15 at the Aidenbachstrasse metro station, a quarrel broke out between two groups of young people.
A passer-by alerted the police, who came in with several squads.
Initial investigations revealed that a 17-year-old from Munich had pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the railing.
The 17-year-old's group helped the victim climb off the tracks.
There was no danger from an oncoming train.
According to the police, there were further clashes between the two men.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his identity was later revealed.
He accompanied his father to the police inspectorate 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer calls for more time to be spent on data retention
The data storage is currently suspended.
However, according to a media report, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the retention period.
He wants to use it to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
The German government has also agreed to extend the period of retention of data for the first time in the next six months.
As the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported, Seehofer asked the Justice Minister, Christine Lambrecht (SPD), in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He believes that it is "reasonable to make urgently needed changes in the law now", the newspaper quotes the letter as saying.
Currently, the data storage is suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected to be taken on this.
The report also calls for the introduction of a new system of taxation, which would be more effective and more effective.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be useful to examine whether legal adjustments were needed once the courts had made their decision.
In June, Seehofer and the interior ministers of the Länder had already advocated the retention of data in the fight against child abuse and child pornography.
NBA: Strip club anger for Clippers star Lou Williams is a major factor in the team's decision to fold.
The excitement of the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, a professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he was still visiting the Magic City strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who has admitted to the visit, according to ESPN, is back in isolation, being tested daily for COVID-19.
The reason for his visit is Chicken Wings.
Last February, Sweet Lou, as he's known in the NBA, expressed his love for these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame have the best wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has ordered Williams to a 10-day quarantine.
The Clippers star will miss the first two official games after the playoff phase.
The NBA is playing the Corona season finale at Disney World.
The top 22 teams are currently preparing for the season finale, which begins Friday night.
Söder speaks after mass infection to the Corona situation
The Commission has also been working with the European Parliament to ensure that the European Union's environmental policy is properly implemented.
The press conference will be live-streamed on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau County has alarmed the authorities and politicians.
The large vegetable farm currently employs nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries, over a third of whom have been infected with the coronavirus.
The yard is now under quarantine and is closed off with a construction fence.
No one is to leave the premises, food is being delivered.
The authorities are now offering free coronavirus tests to the community's 3,300 or so residents.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the county council office has assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Torture of conscience": Confessions of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative", lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense attorney added: "He deeply regrets the act, and the confession was a release for him".
He said his mandate was "plagued by remorse and deeply concerned by the scale of the destruction".
If convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor's office.
The Gothic cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Nantes was badly damaged by a fire on Saturday night.
The fire had broken out in three separate locations in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, now in custody, was arrested hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
With no evidence of a violent break-in, he quickly became the focus of investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended that the 50+1 rule be abolished.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates finished facts", Grindel told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
He stressed: 'For clubs that are most likely to become dangerous, Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
The Commission has also decided to extend the scope of the directive to cover the whole of the European Union, in particular the European Community.
He expressed doubts, however, as to whether the German Football League would be prepared to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to surround the Bundesliga as a business location in a European single market", said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "attempts to ensure a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only end up weakening the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund has a turnover of 500 million and RB Leipzig has a turnover of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million", said the 58-year-old.
Looking back, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this error and leaked it to the press instead of talking to me about it", Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've been very busy as a human being".
The gift, worth some 11,000 euros, had been given to him by a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation and it was right to take the consequences", Grindel said.
"I have been completely transparent and unbiased in my handling of the ominous gift of a watch.
Many in the DFB knew about it".
He never "made a fuss of the gift", assured the 58-year-old.
"That may be naïve, but at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
Black Lives Matter: Injured and one dead
Protests against police brutality in the United States have been fueled by Donald Trump's deployment of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes between protesters and police occurred in several cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was shot and killed as a protest train crossed a crossroads.
Earlier, Portland had seen another clash during protests against racism and police brutality.
Security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of partly armed protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky, Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old college student was shot and killed in a drug raid on her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who didn't live there, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, three people were injured when a member of a group calling itself the Black Americans' Armed Alliance fired a gun.
NBC News reports that they were taken to a hospital.
None of them were in danger of death.
Police set up barricades because counter-protesters had also formed a white militia.
The two groups did not meet in person.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
Police have taken a suspect into custody.
She has not yet provided any further details on the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said that he, like many in the city, was "devastated and bewildered" by what had happened.
In the American metropolis of Seattle, protesters also clashed with police on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction truck outside a juvenile detention center, and police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assaulting a police officer.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, fired fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly put out.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of people demonstrating on a highway.
Police said that one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was injured and taken to the hospital.
Also, windows were broken in a courthouse there and a fire was set, according to police.
Investigations have been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: historical costumes in the face of the Corona
Although the big sauna was absent from the resort, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party miles in the city center were missing, the crowds and program highlights such as burning hall, Rakoczy ball or parade, many came at the cost of the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading the Rakoczy Flair", says executive director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have been very happy.
In principle, one goes back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, when only the historical ones were the focus of the festival.
A pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years for the Rakoczy Festival.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple have been enjoying themselves at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historic ones stroll, and listening to live Cuban music at the Casino Restaurant.
"I find it very pleasant", says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds that are not usually part of Rakoczy.
However, it lacks the usual highlights of the programme, most notably the Saale fire on Friday evening and the historic parade and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been perfect this year", she says.
Rakoczy horse-racing tournament to be held again
For the actors of the historical Kurgäste, the alternative programme meant partly more work.
For instance, Christina Gold, who participates in the parade in a normal year and is seen in the carriage of the spa café.
This year, she was walking around town in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
"It's more tiring, otherwise we have it easier", she says.
The riders' club had less to do, even when individual riders were in the park.
"We very much hope that the Equestrian Squadron will be allowed to take place again next year", says chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break, a Rakoczy-horseback riding tournament will be held again in 2021.
28 Corona cases in Spanish second division Fuenlabrada
Spanish football's second division club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper into crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newcomer flew to the city of A Coruña from near Madrid on July 20 for a game despite first coronavirus cases, one setback has followed the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, with one hospitalized, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now they're even in danger of being relegated to the B-group of the Second Division.
Last Monday's match against Deportivo La Coruña was cancelled at the last minute, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, and the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced resignation of the club.
The players and other members of the team are being quarantined in a hotel.
"They have not received a fresh towel or gel until the sixth day of quarantine", wrote the sports newspaper AS.
Photos show players hanging up club and underwear in their hotel rooms to dry after apparently having to wash them themselves.
The bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem was food.
"Not good enough", wrote "AS".
The club management, however, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The allegation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The Spanish football association's coronavirus rules have not been violated, the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, stressed, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper Marca.
The Commission has also proposed that the Member States should be allowed to adopt measures to prevent the spread of the disease in the Community.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members had tested positive for coronavirus.
The game was called off 60 minutes before kick-off, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to catch horses at the steam locomotive
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, shortly before 6 a.m., a road user reported two free-running horses on the Zubringer between the entrance of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already between the Zubringer and the village of Dampfach.
After the officers had won the horses' confidence, they each had a rope taken in the patrol car.
Cycling pro Tony Martin: career-continuation is conceivable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is considering a career extension.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just discussing with the team the framework conditions, how and in what form it could continue", the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
He said that the negotiations with his team were also about the number of days of racing.
Or any other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He said that he used to get up after a fall and his first thought was, "Get back on the bike.
Now, as the father of a little girl, I think, "What if?"
The cycling pro admitted that there are aspects with which he is having increasing difficulty.
"But it was good to see how much I enjoyed cycling during the coronavirus.
The time trial specialist will return to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavarian roads this weekend
The fine weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
At least three people die on the motorcycle.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several people, mostly young people, have died in accidents on Bavarian roads over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was hit by a car on the opposite track near Schönthal, Cham County, on Saturday.
Why the car had gone off the track was unclear at first.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old man crashed his motorcycle into a horse-drawn carriage.
Police say he was on his way down the Beilngries.
He hit the carriage in a left turn.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the 12 people in the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old man died in the Upper Palatinate town of Kötzting.
He had been lying on a road on Sunday night and was run over by a 42-year-old motorist.
Police suspected the 18-year-old was trying to sleep.
The driver was unable to stop in time.
In the Schönberg area (Freyung-Grafenau district) a 57-year-old biker collided head-on with a car in a right-hand curve despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the other three people in the car were uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was the subject of a debate on Saturday by Bavaria's Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the August anti-ride ban biker protests, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to major investments such as under-ride protection on guideboards and the dismantling of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot in recent years in terms of the safety of motorcyclists", the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheeler deaths decreased by about 28 percent from 2011".
Kovac is testing with Monaco against Frankfurt
The new club AS Monaco will soon be reunited with Eintracht Frankfurt.
The eight-time French champion will be playing at the Hessen, the former club of the Croat, on 1 August (18:00).
For the Bundesliga club, it is the first and only hardship test before the second leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the match will be held without spectators.
"We are looking forward to this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends", said Kovac.
The 48-year-old said that this was an interesting test for the sport.
Before his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac coached Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB-Pokal.
"A high-quality opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in view of the game against Basel.
"I'm looking forward to meeting Niko Kovac again, as are all Frankfurters", said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat in the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurt team lost the first leg of the semi-final against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: County court barely passes lockdown
In the County Court, the number of known new coronavirus infections increased further over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person recovered and is no longer included in this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
And there's a case in the city court.
This means that the Hof area is approaching the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 Killed by Monsoon Rains in Southeast Asia
The severe flooding in Southeast Asia has affected more than 9 million people, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
The heavy monsoon rains killed 700 people.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is reaching isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers lost their crops.
Tanks in the National Park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 armoured rhinos died in landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year's floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the government has built housing for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's difficult to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also maintained in Grenezn.
Those who once had a house, even if it was small and resembled a hut, often do not want to spend their life in a large apartment block.
Many homes are empty, but the government wants them to be occupied soon by those who lost their homes to the floods.

105 people died related to the lung disease.
Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Economy Ministry said in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible but unjust", one commentary said.
"With 50 percent of children in Argentina living in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of South America's second largest economy is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around US$ 66 billion (around € 59 billion).
If no agreement is reached, the country is facing another bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
The last time the creditors demanded higher interest rates on the government bonds and changes in some contractual clauses.
The Argentine Government, however, is sticking to its latest offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent recently.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power of about ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had defaulted on interest payments of US$503 million and had entered into a limited default.
Worked - not yet in private life
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would be succeeding Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer with a doctorate began her work, and the normal day's business was already running at full speed.
"I have to get there in private", she says, laughing.
The short lead time was not enough to move the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden completely, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who is a judge at the district court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to take care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also had the opportunity to spend the night with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Having grown up in the neighbouring county, she has of course long been familiar with the town of Eggenfelden.
She said that when she visited the town with her family in recent months, she had noticed that "Eggenfelden is a really nice little town".
She was all the more pleased that she had run for the vacant post in the selection procedure.
Her home in Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: after studying law in Passau, she completed her period as a lecturer and took the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary assistant, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also studied "alongside" the doctorate in labour law - she took her first job as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, and eventually moved to Regensburg.
Since then she has been representing clients in various notarial offices.
The 39-year-old explained that when the post in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the imminent retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw that the right time had come for her to return to her full professional career.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacancy in the notary office, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has a compliment for the team of the law firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on pre-recorded procedures makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already contacted a local institution for kindergarten and nursery places.
And if all goes well, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to discover the most beautiful jogging tracks of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund's biggest stadium in Germany will be less than 20% full at the start of the season if fans return.
"Due to the distance regulations, which must be complied with, we are planning to have 12,000 to 15,000 spectators as it stands", Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district town holds a little more than 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games of the last season caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at the BVB, hopes that some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can be opened again in addition to the normal seats: "It is, of course, a blow to the office if these revenues are completely wiped out".
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should be given the opportunity to adopt a common position on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos.
"When many businesses are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, the need for entertainment is limited", Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing manager praised the BVB professionals for their partial pay cut, which is supposed to help overcome the crisis: "Of course the players know that their pay cut has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work".
Small Miracles: Early Start in Life with a Few Hundred Grams
Weighing little more than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood throughout his body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The baby is one of about 400 premature babies treated annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight, weighing less than a pound at birth.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they are not in tune - "and like", says Berndt Urlesberger.
"Although they don't scream as loud as big babies".
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona's theatre in the classroom, the 9th grade of the St. Jakob's Gymnasium in Abtsgünd experienced the Whiteboard as a stage just before the holidays began.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Aalen theatre presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the pupils - and this via video.
Afterwards, the pupils were able to exchange information about the play and the performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the lessons.
Although all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage would provide additional incentives, the theatre also offers the potential for contact in schools.
"If we improve the technical framework further, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation", said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
If TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of Sunday's draw.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal is certain.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the Sunday night ARD Sports Show draw.
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the field of participants is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
By voluntarily giving up semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto-Pokal (4 or 5 September).
There, the Lions will either meet the Würzburg Kickers or the Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If second division club Würzburg reaches the final, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be played between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the start of the third league.
Gone with the Wind movie legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104 of natural causes, her spokeswoman confirmed to the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic Gone with the Wind (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theater artist Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia from Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
The Warner Brothers studio signed her to a seven-year contract and brought her out in a big way alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight movies with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar for her leading role in To Each His Own.
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later, she won the award for best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier suggested her for the lead role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
She was in "Leg for a Corpse" with her longtime friend Bette Davis.
From her marriage to writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), she had a son, Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
That marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler misses the finals in the second half of the season
World runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler have missed the final of the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost in the semifinals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1: 2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
The last time Thole/Wickler played in Rome was in September last year at the World Tour Final.
In the final at the Rhine, their winner Ehlers/Flügen lost to the surprise team of Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand in early September: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger / Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms / Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner / Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz's expulsion from the AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD", said Benjamin Strasser, the FDP's interior policy chief, to the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The AfD's Federal Court of Arbitration confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided in May, after several hours of negotiation.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been expelled long ago", said Strasser.
"But there is no political will in the AfD to do so, because right-wing extremism has become part of the party".
The CSU Secretary-General, Markus Blume, also said the same thing: "Andreas Kalbitz's exclusion does not mean anything and does not change anything", he told Welt am Sonntag.
"It speaks volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD".
Blume predicts that the AfD will fall below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially disbanded "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the protection of the Constitution classifies the ströning as "a guaranteed right-wing extremist endeavour".
In May, the AfD's federal executive board expelled Kalbitz from the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated his previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Party in the Brandenburg State Parliament, Sebastian Walter, also emphasised that the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extremist party, with or without Kalbitz".
This decision will not weaken the Bundespartei or the right wing.
"The maneuver of the mutineering troops is clear.
"The government is not going to be able to monitor the situation, and it is not going to be able to monitor the situation.
"The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts they called.
A dismissal will not change anything", said Erik Stohn, secretary general of the Brandenburg SPD, commenting on the Kalbitz decision.
"Here the AfD and the group have held their right-wing leaders to this day".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership of the AfD will continue.
The German government has announced that it will now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration.
North Sea wind farms provide 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants in the German North Sea have delivered 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity to the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the Bayreuth network operator Tennet.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and for its transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network, have added another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
The total wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus amounts to 13.73 TWh, compared to just over 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Offshore wind power accounts for almost 19 percent of all wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms increase generation capacity
The increase in the contribution of offshore wind energy is due to the increase in generation capacity, as well as to the wind conditions, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full capacity at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this purpose, and according to Tennet it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing €20 billion in expanding offshore grid connections by then", said Tennet's managing director, Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, offshore wind farms cannot reach their full capacity, but only about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2nd, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than 6 gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce between 2.5 and 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, the equivalent of three to four nuclear power plants.
This would provide electricity for nearly seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small 130th anniversary party.
Birthday of the Gmunder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona pause.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was the band Defenders of the Universe on the southern Kornhaus square.
North of the gallery, the Sandtogether Society was involved.
Windfestberg cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival is not going to take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have not taken this decision lightly and - aware of the economic difficulties for those involved - have hoped until the last minute", said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partid).
"But ultimately, as the organisers here, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands of people had flocked to the mainland and into the tent, the minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current coronavirus protection regulations could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that there would not have been much left of a popular festival.
In addition, the organisational and supervisory effort would be disproportionately increased.
Rumberg's been moved to next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Worth is unbeatable in the pole vault
Achilles - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the top equestrian at the Austrian dressage tournament.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four races in four starts over the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix in Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeatable in the Grand Prix Special and the Kür on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the Sunday special.
In the Kür, the German was also clear of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Saturday at Quantaz.
Worth's winning horse, Quantaz, is owned by Max Theurer.
The world's most successful dressage rider is set to establish the 10-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first ever cure.
In the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had already won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled there for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms
The Worms University of Applied Sciences is continuing its work: the German Federal Aviation Administration is giving a professorship in air traffic management.
A contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship offers the possibility of starting studies not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This will enable us to train twice as many students as before.
At the same time, the capacity of both the DFS's College and the Air Traffic Control Academy is being used to the same extent.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and staffing of professorships.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students are in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training to become air traffic controllers at the Worms University of Applied Sciences.
This year, nine students have already started.
The experience of DFS so far has been very positive, and the performance of the students has been excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training is a major factor in further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, we find it difficult to promote economically.
We are confident that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
To continue to fulfil our statutory mandate, we need highly qualified staff", says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, DFS's Chief Executive Officer, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the Foundation Professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide pilots with a broad, multidisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university, while at the same time strengthening our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Dr Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University, also emphasises this point: "The Foundation Professorship is an important bridge between science and business.
We want to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor programme Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German Air Traffic Control Agency is both a motivation and an obligation for the University of Applied Sciences Worms to further develop its teaching and research competence in the fields of the future of aviation.
The first endowed professorship for a dual degree course would enable the university to set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students in preparation for the pilots of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasises: "Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique position in Rhineland Palatinate, with its focus on aviation.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Emergency shuttle landing on the A45
The A45 motorway was completely closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man was driving a Ford straight ahead at the Alzenau-Mitte exit of the curve at about 12:40 and landed on the dashboard.
The front airbags were detonated by the impact, and the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and was taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At this time, the police believe that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about EUR 2000, had to be towed.
Heil wants to explore other sectors after the meat industry
The Corona crisis has brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
The law is about to be tightened.
But are they right - and will they stay that way?
The Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors as well, following the strict regulations now planned against malpractice in the meat industry.
"We will look at each sector individually and then take appropriate measures for each sector if necessary", Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
German employers are already warning against restricting employment contracts in general.
After the massive outbreak of the coronavirus in the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to adopt a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses will no longer be allowed to employ outside staff for slaughter, cutting and processing of meat.
The Commission has proposed that the Commission should be given the opportunity to present a report on the implementation of the directive.
The employers' president, Ingo Kramer, told dpa: "Fingers crossed for a general restriction of work contracts and worker transfer, if you don't want to completely strangle the economy".
For example, in many sectors of the craft, construction and plant building industries, contracts are the basis for creating value for the customer.
"The failings of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My aim is not to prohibit employment contracts throughout the German economy".
Employment contracts are useful.
"When an industrial firm hires a craftsman to install a safety system, it is a normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on contracts and temporary work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
The draft law, which is being discussed in the Netherlands, is aimed at reducing the number of people who are unemployed, and at reducing the number of people who are unemployed.
The consumer price would therefore increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram of product if the ban were to be lifted.
Many Eastern European workers from contracting companies worked in the industry for 16 hours a day, according to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
Often they had no rest.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation regarding the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively harsh law had already been put in place for the meat industry in 2017.
But these had been bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now it's time to clean up the mess".
The politician announced: "The law on safety and health at work, which we are planning to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, includes measures that are not limited to the meat industry - for example, higher safety inspection rates or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft law before the dpa includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry and to the law on occupational safety.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the European Union's financial instruments.
"I would like to see more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport", Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
But more controls also require more staff.
Three killed in German ultralight plane crash
Three people died when an ultralight plane crashed into a multi-family house in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, according to police.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, a spokesman for the district headquarters in Wesel said.
Police say a parachute was found at the crash site.
The Rheinische Post reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a single- or two-family house.
No further details were given at the time.
The evacuation of the Frankfurt Opera Square has been peaceful
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opera House on Sunday night went peacefully.
Lastly, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left before the curfew began at 1 a.m.
The police had been on duty since early evening with numerous officers, and a large police presence was visible throughout the city area.
For the first time, a curfew was imposed this weekend at midnight on the Opera House, where a week ago riots broke out.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of celebrants.
At least five officers were injured, according to police reports, and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night before Saturday had also been quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 1:25 p.m.
She was taken to the hospital in Kassel.
The fire department used thermal imaging cameras to search for possible passengers.
The woman was on her way to Hümme on the federal road 83 when her car went off the road and overturned several times.
To save the injured woman, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the escalator with a thermal imaging camera.
The Warburg drone squadron, which also operates with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered to search for people.
However, the emergency services found no one among the tall corn crops.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to the Kassel clinic for further treatment.
Almost 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on the scene.
The federal road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team of the five-time World Player of the Year won the 36th Scudetto in club history with a perfect 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored with 1:0 remaining.
With 83 points, Turin, which entered without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, two days before the end of the season of Serie A, can no longer be displaced from first place.
Inter Milan are seven points behind in the second place.
Juventus were harmless in the first half, despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo hit the final action after a free-kick variation.
Miralem Pjanic was used as a late substitute, and the 35-year-old shot straight from the penalty area with a 45+7.
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0 after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This was a lackluster but decisive success.
The foul-five meter thrown at the plate in the 89th minute was probably the only one that Ronaldo himself scored correctly in terms of the goalkeeper rating.
"It's complicated to stay on your feet mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very easily", explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
The Juve coach said that the mental exhaustion of his players was particularly severe.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
The reassuring lead at the top of the table at the end of Juve was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five victories.
It's not clear if Ronaldo will be the goalkeeper king.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has 34 goals on his account after his three-pack in the 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is currently held by Juve's current professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football will have another shot at the title.
Juventus are in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, but will have to face Olympique Lyon on 7 August in a 0-1 away draw to reach the final in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal motor races have been recorded
Stuttgart - Despite the threat of fines and court judgments, motorists continue to give gas in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparable figures for the previous years, the races are increasingly giving the judicial authorities more work: In the public prosecutors' offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organised events, as can be seen from the Ministry of the Interior's response to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously collided with each other or fled from the police - also reported as illegal racing.
The drivers were mostly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and also asked to pay: according to the Ministry of Interior, a total of 113 fines and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
But there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than in the past and showed more frequently because of the number of tragic accidents and lawsuits in recent years, said a ministry spokesman.
Highway 8 is a particular favorite of racing fans, where drivers often stop to clear the way for a race.
In August last year, a dozen drivers were caught in the act near Kirchheim, and three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racing track"
In fact, the police register more races on the A81 than on any other federal highway.
The speed limit is used to try to slow the rails on the particularly affected section between the narrow and the winding roads.
The mostly expensive and fancy sports and luxury coaches often have Swiss license plates, because drivers avoid the high fines for speeding and car racing in the neighboring country to Germany for the grass.
The SPD cannot limit speed limits to a few distances: "If we had a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would be able to solve this problem on motorways", says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The threshold for speed would be much higher if you were not allowed to travel legally at 200 km/h or more".
Rivoir is less concerned with education or image campaigns: "Those who ignore all the rules in this way and put their own life and that of other road users at risk are hardly approachable by reason".
ADAC calls for more police action
But this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speed limits will not deter racers", says Holger Bach, head of the transport and environment department at ADAC Württemberg.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a directive on the protection of the environment.
Not infrequently, the high-tour power show becomes painful and serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a night crash in Stuttgart city center and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have competed in a car race in November.
One of the vehicles veered off the road, hit a garden wall, and was left on its side, killing the 18-year-old passenger.
21 more people have been injured in the races over the past two years.
However, Interior Minister Thomas Strobl does not see the need for harsher penalties: "The need for legislative action to punish illegal motor racing more harshly is not seen", the Home Office paper says.
July 23 blackout: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from diner
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a pub in Rohrdorf (Calw County) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the Valley Road at about 3:40 and ran towards the diner.
There he noticed a man taking drinks from the refrigerator and then leaving the snack bar through a previously locked front door.
The perp fled towards the meadows behind the diner.
The burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range, according to police.
The suspect is described as being between 5'6" and 6'7" tall and of a stout build.
In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie, black trousers and light shoes.
Any further witness statements will be taken by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory in the final stage of the Sibiu Tour
Cycling pro Pascal Ackermann has scored his second win of the day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfälzer from the Bora-hansgrohe team won the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt, after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was season three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall standings, his Austrian team mate Gregor Mühlberger won.
The 26-year-old had confidently decided to race the mountain time trial and thus took over the lead in the class.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time trials.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a win", Ackermann said after his victory on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic", said the 26-year-old.
He said he just put on his sprint 300 yards from the finish line, and it worked perfectly.
In accordance with the rules of the UCI World Federation, a corona test was carried out on all the participants and their companions six days before the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and attendants were isolated from the organizing team and media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
No spectators were allowed at the start and finish lines.
The headquarters gave instructions for lay resuscitation.
A tragic accident occurred on Sunday afternoon in the Düsseldorf-Garath area.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) was bathing when he suddenly fell into the water.
According to the fire department, the 911 call came in just before 1:00.
"A commanding officer immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation", a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The rescue workers who arrived soon began the resuscitation efforts.
The child, whose life was in danger, was taken to the hospital under intensive care.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police have routinely begun an investigation into the cause of the accident.
Fire department spokesman: "We believe there was a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and, at times, over 1,000 people attended a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police have implemented their announcement to control such events more closely.
A major Tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police in Mittelfranken, an increased number of vehicles were detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at around 22.30 in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then conducted a number of vehicle searches.
The police recently announced that they would be taking more action against so-called car posers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted at the top a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police estimates.
However, only a small proportion of the people present in the "autopose" and tuning scene can be attributed to this.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene was a response to the police's appeal.
The vehicles and persons present on the spot suggested that the victims were mainly spectators.
In addition, the majority of those present observed the current rules for infection control, in particular the minimum distance and the use of a mouth-nose guard.
The on-site inspection was completed at approximately 1:00 a.m.
In total, officials found 10 vehicles with such structural changes that their operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There was no illegal motor racing.
"The police headquarters in Mittelfranken will continue to monitor the situation and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the arrival of spectators", it said.
News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have nice rims, we can't scratch them", says Schrödinger.
They'd use special tape for that.
The company also had to be careful not to damage the cars because they are wider.
"The young people should get their cars back in one piece".
Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time working
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) claims that it is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term workers' pay.
"This is extremely low for the more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time working", said Daniel Terzenbach, the managing director responsible for operational business, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
The BA had to react quickly when a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-term work at the beginning of the corona crisis.
The examination normally takes up to three weeks.
"We had no time to spare in this hot phase.
We shall therefore be looking at the final accounts.
I'm sure there's a lot more to come.
We are not naive and we have a long breath".
The evidence of abuse often came from the employees or trade unions concerned.
It also uses BA's analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments vary, but we are preparing for the case and are already training our staff in the employment agencies for the handling of insolvency claims".
The Commission's proposal is to be adopted by the end of the year.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the Neues Garten.
The collection was dissolved at 20.48 by the station drivers of the Foundation of Prussian Castles and Gardens (SPSG), the Foundation informed on PNN request.
The youths would then have left the park.
On Saturday night, some youngsters would have played rugby at the Neues Garten.
The meadow had been cleared by rangers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are always illegal parties in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation, there are always gatherings where the distancing and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 social order are not observed.
At the end of June, about 300 people came to a party in the Babelsberg Park, and a week later, about 150 people celebrated in the Neue Garten.
Even without a Corona order, the parks will be closed at night.
The parking regulations prohibit the storage of food on the meadows, with only a few exceptions.
The foundation has long complained that visitors are leaving more and more garbage behind and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have taken on a new dimension.
In the district of Neukölln, in the town of Hasenheide, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass testing of tourist site after coronavirus outbreak
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, the provincial authorities said in Linz.
More than 100 results were pending that evening.
Many of the infected are young trainees in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest has also tested positive.
Residents, visitors and tourism officials have been asked to stay indoors on Saturday night.
Curfew was set at 11:00.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, to dpa.
The Commission has also been informed that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid with the common market.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are Germans.
By Friday, the first cases of infection had become public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns who had celebrated in several premises and may have become infected there.
"We all liked to do that when we were young", he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to sensitize young employees to the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 onwards were contacted.
The outbreak is reminiscent of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of the coronavirus spread across Europe during the initial phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main areas of new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record-holder Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the Premier League on the final day of the season with a 2-0 victory over direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, as Chelsea FC came through and also qualified for the top flight as fourth.
In the battle against relegation, Aston Villa were able to celebrate.
Manchester United took the lead on a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in extra time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) made the final stand.
Chelsea, in the Champions League quarter-finals against FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) with a score of 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"It means a lot to me", said coach Frank Lampard, who is in his first season as Chelsea manager, and facing Arsenal in the FA Cup final.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who with a meagre 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace still passed the Wolves and started as sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the away game against Watford and Bournemouth, but had to contend with West Ham United for a long time.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84) was quickly overtaken by Andrei Jarmolenko (85).
The 1-0 draw was enough, however, because Watford lost 2-3 to Arsenal.
The club, which has lost three managers this season, is relegated after five years in the top flight.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save themselves by going 3-1 down at Everton.
There was a missing point at the end.
Liverpool, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) win over Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
The points record in English football was just missed by coach Jürgen Klopp and his team.
The record is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle's lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
'It was an exceptional season for this wonderful club,' said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, 'and that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard".
The Premier League bosses will be happy with the result.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even talk of either abandoning the Games prematurely or of holding the remaining games on neutral ground.
Finally, the season was played out without any special incidents - however, as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrest and violence in anti-Netanyahu demonstrations
Protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are growing more violent.
Violent clashes have occurred at night.
The Israeli police have used violence against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative government leader Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people have been arrested for taking part in the riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, about 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday night.
They were protesting against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
Protesters banged drums, blew horns, and called for Netanyahu's resignation.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also detained, the news website "ynet" reported.
Protests also took place in many other places in Israel, including in front of the prime minister's private residence in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on protesters on the side of the road from a moving car, according to police.
Another man was arrested after he stabbed a protester in the south of the country.
The protester had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several recent demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations are part of the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
He is accused of premature relaxation and lack of preparation for a second wave of corona.
The Corona crisis has hit the country's economy hard.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent recently.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council of Ministers should be consulted on the matter.
Ahlen - A road accident on the B58 near Ahlen on Saturday afternoon left nine people with minor injuries.
A female driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
Police: "Probably she had brake suddenly because she wanted to turn".
The driver of a Mercedes van that was behind her must have seen it too late.
He was hitting the back of the car.
Three passengers in the car and six in the van suffered minor injuries.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea cordoned off border town after suspected coronavirus case
North Korea has seen "a bright success" in its own measures to combat the coronavirus.
Now the country reports a suspected case for the first time.
North Korea has shut down a major city for fear of a catastrophic outbreak, as the country's first official suspected case of coronavirus has been confirmed.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological controls in the past six months, "the virulent virus may have been smuggled into the country", state media reported.
The region around the border town of Kaesong has been declared a state of emergency.
The Communist leadership has declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the quarantined country.
North Korea had not reported a single case of infection and described its response as a "bright success".
The figures were disputed abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in a "runaway" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was no initial confirmation from South Korea that the border crossing occurred within the four-kilometer-wide and mostly mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, has admitted the possibility of illegal border crossings into North Korea is high.
The Commission has also carried out investigations on a number of individuals.
North Korea said it had called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo chaired by Kim Jong Un on Saturday over the alleged incident.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a precautionary measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and region from others", it said.
The person concerned and all persons in Kaesong who had been in contact with him had been placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is to investigate the "escape case" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection still to be discussed before long summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committee will vote on the development plan for the major project Innerstadtentwicklung-Ost", reads the middle part of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 in the large hall of the CongressCenter Pforzheim.
The upgrading of the Eastern City in particular is controversial to the end.
The majority in favour is narrow, and in recent times in some committees it has been even negative, depending on the number of members present.
The project was developed by the local authorities and the local council, and after almost ten years of preparation, the project opponent Reinhard Klein criticized it as "external opposition", "uncertain", "speculation", "smear" and "conscious misrepresentation".
"Everyone thinks they know better", says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim list of citizens.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in the position of saying: 'I know what I am talking about'.
The exit would make the city cheaper, the Technical Town Hall was contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced, to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently from what is predicted in the town hall and by the economic proponents.
The idea of building the City through its own efforts and not through an investor was his plan B. A day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also opposes the project, put forward an alternative concept.
It also provides for the rehabilitation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening up of the Schlossberg, the leasing of the ex-Thales for administrative purposes and a more modest reorganization of the town centre, ideally with local actors.
Environmental issues are central
The Commission will also be able to provide the necessary information to the Member States.
The municipal council will vote on the noise action plan, among other things.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheimer against the health effects of noise caused by road traffic, including many time-limits.
In a press release, the local transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30, but says that the city's political leaders are not to blame for this, because by neglecting bus traffic with thinned speeds and by little commitment to cycling, they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession of the state of Baden-Württemberg to the climate protection pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must take care of the coronavirus precautions.
With many delays Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the League of Super Sports Cars could begin regular operations, the first test drives were now due.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first official trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen took his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season", says Zimmermann.
"For example, with the ABS, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman, despite only 25 years of experience in GT racing, has already been able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
"I'm not a newcomer to motorsport, but each new series brings new challenges", says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I have a great rapport and we've made tremendous progress on the Lausitzring from session to session".
It is there, at the Lausitzring, that the GT Masters will be racing for the first time.
From July 31st, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lausitz.
But Zimmerman, one of 15 serial novices, knows the route.
He was a guest at the Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track a little bit", says Zimmermann, who is racing for the Friedrichshafen racing team Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitz ring has many fast passages, "which must be optimally hit to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is, that will be revealed in two weeks.
"The teams play a little poker in the tests", he says.
"But in the end, we are very satisfied and look forward to our first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
Seven races are scheduled to take place before the beginning of November.
Currently, no spectators are allowed, but there is a special guest.
In mid-August, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the wheel of a GT at the Nürburgring.
British transport minister caught off guard by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister off-guard, according to press reports.
According to the report, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues back home decided to take the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising coronavirus numbers in Spain, the London Cabinet removed Spain from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine.
The new rules will be in place from today, Sunday, and will also require Shapps to be quarantined upon his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme is only for those who are just on holiday, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
In Austria, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"A number of ministers may have known in advance that there was a possibility that a quarantine for holidaymakers would be imposed in Spain", commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Just over a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfews, infection rates in the country are rising again.
Virologists blame the new outbreak mainly on the nightlife.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British Government currently advises against non-essential travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that his country's warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons for Navy Day.
These weapons, unique in the world, will expand the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces, Putin said at the Central Naval Parade in St. Petersburg on Sunday.
The Ministry of Defence also informed Interfax of successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They're considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropopedeo is being built
The Poseidon nuclear-capable submarine torpedo is also under construction, it said.
The planned seed drone is designed to destroy coastal targets.
The President, who himself was on a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships will be commissioned into the individual naval units of the largest country on earth.
Russia has a coastline as vast as any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been Russia's reliable protector, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors across the country.
On many other Russian coasts, naval forces also held parades on Navy Day.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
That's where the shells were fired.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" hits Texas: Aid made more difficult by Corona
WASHINGTON - The first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rains threatened parts of the state, the National Hurricane Center of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said late on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of emergency in several counties.
The coronavirus pandemic raging in Texas has made it difficult for the workers to do their jobs, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is a tremendous challenge", Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the hurricane in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and will be exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by COVID-19 in the state".
According to Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus pandemic has killed about 5,000 people in Texas alone.
Abbott urged people to be careful when leaving their homes.
They should not disregard practices "that we've become accustomed to", such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested for corona.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With winds of up to 90 miles per hour, "Hanna" was said by authorities to have made landfall on Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to a category one hurricane.
A storm surge warning was issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, but was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening as Hanna moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
Douglas is moving to Hawaii.
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was moving toward Hawaii Sunday night with winds of about 90 miles an hour.
The Hurricane Center, however, expected it to continue to weaken.
The forecast calls for it to be near the main Hawaiian islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expects an above-average active hurricane season this year, following a prediction in May.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the agency had stated.
On average, there are six hurricanes a year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into major storms.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, and that of a below-average season is only 10 percent, it said at the time.
President Donald Trump tweeted that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with affected states.
Four goals denied: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic was denied two goals
The match was a nightmare for Sassuolo Calcio, who was furious with the referee's video assistant after the match ended 0-2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A.
"A festival of uncapped goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so hard on a team", commented the Corriere dello Sport.
The hosts Naples had taken the lead in the 8th minute through a goal from outfield defender Elseid Hisaj, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the equaliser.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the shot back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic threw the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goal scored by Francesco Caputo (50) and Domenico Berardi (61) was also returned by the referee team, as indicated by the VAR.
In the second half, Allan made the 2-0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road, punishing Sassuolo like no team has before.
The new technology is setting records", says the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard is injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for the double-winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick recovered "quite well" and after the first team training he has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot and is in danger of missing out on crucial first-class duels.
In the Munich muddy weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the court with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted regular player will have to pause in the fight for the title is open.
The 24-year-old will be hoping for a place in the quarter-final against Chelsea on 8 August, but the final tournament in Lisbon will start on 12 August.
The Bavarians will not let the incident at training on Sunday stop them.
Flick, in his personal triple formula, named the three attributes he wants to see in his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and focus will be shown to his title-seeking fans in the next 28 days, ideally until the championship final on August 23.
"We have done our homework with excellence, with championship and trophy.
Now we have to create the special thing", said Flick.
Until the Munich team can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve, the first thing is the eighth-final obligation against Chelsea.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become the nightmare of Bayern again in the home arena like in the lost "final dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game", demanded Flick.
A test of consensus is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, on a unique August.
31 players were welcomed to the Säbener Street, including the new players around the Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who for the first time after his transfer from Manchester City met all new colleagues on the pitch.
"Leroy has adapted well, like all newcomers", Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer only train with, Flick talked much more about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team strength training is now in place for the Londoners, who, unlike the flick ensemble, are in rhythm.
After that, the Munich team could face FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi in the quarter-finals, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin could be their opponents in the semi-finals.
The head coach, who will be able to rely on the services of his new assistant, Miroslav Klose, in training from Tuesday, stressed that a path to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy".
World record-setting Klose and Flick know about so many joint tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-to-100-set.
Flick said working with his current team was "a pleasure".
The 'focus on winning' is an impressive trait of his team.
The nine-team tournament was also ambitious on Sunday.
The team was composed of all the top players, including Thiago, who was willing to emigrate, and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts after the end of the season in the top flight are not certain.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to curate its world champion.
Since the required number of continents cannot be raced, the FIA has to improvise to award the World Championship titles.
All the America's Cup races have been cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more specific
The racing calendar of the current Formula One season continues to take shape.
To the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three more racing tracks were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and the Portimão in Portugal will be used.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will battle for World Championship points at the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
The 2020 race calendar thus comprises 13 races as of the current date.
"We are pleased to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season", said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motor sport are to be held during this extraordinary season.
Formula One is wrapping up its Asian season.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, which are already officially announced, media reports suggest that there could be events in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require racing on three continents
Formula One regulations require that the world championship be held on at least three continents.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are covered, there will be a world champion.
The FIA wants to use a special rule to award the titles, citing "extraordinary circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional March season start in Australia had to be cancelled at short notice due to the impending coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent later this year is not an issue.
And, moreover, Formula One will not be in America this year.
Brazil's rejection of the ban has been met with criticism
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We are looking forward to working with them again next season", said Carey.
The cancellation of the America race drew criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation was not a surprise for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it", said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo region is much lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not to want to race in Brazil would not justify a rejection.
Be prepared for the security measures required.
Greta Thunberg: The evil eye against Donald Trump has gone around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on the famous Late Night show by Stephen Colbert via video link and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night show via video link.
She told of her struggle against the world's powers, among other things.
The teenager also talked about her famous "evil eye" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been making a name for herself with her tireless work on Fridays For Future.
Now, on a popular late-night talk show, she talked about her plans for the future, as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latent Night host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on your show Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me", she said.
"How far people will go to divert attention from the climate crisis", shocked her.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children take to the streets", she said.
She finds "funny" the reactions of heads of state and leading politicians who mock them or even try to silence them on social media, "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she gave US President Trump a bitter look.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, where the actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive look was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip was turned into a GIF, an animated image, that eventually became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the president of the United States at that moment?
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future of the Community, and it is hoping that the Council will be able to take a decision on the matter.
The experienced satirist Colbert had not expected such a quick answer, and he disappeared from the picture with a laugh.
Her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection at the climate conference was remembered by many.
Ex-Dortmund Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now tied with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
Former Dortmund's Ciro Immobile has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB pro contributed three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalty minutes in the extra time of both halves.
With this, the 30-year-old from the fourth place in the table has 34 season goals on his account now before the end of two seasons - as many as Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich scored in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo is second with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening at Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride, where after a fast climb with Fleetwood Mac, he went downhill and then slowly climbed back up.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug addict, cult following, co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, with a further statement to be announced in the coming days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had formed the now legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still remembered today.
The life of the musician ("The End of the Game", "In the Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a meteoric rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There was a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the group's profits to charity.
He began to perform in loose robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems are also thought to have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, according to biographers.
Green was treated in the psychiatric ward for a long time.
For much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in Bethnal Green, London, to a working-class Jewish family in 1946.
From a young age, he was inspired by American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned his first guitar moves.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to perform as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly after, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green formed Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with fellow Bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", written by Green, gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But his rapid rise soon revealed his dark side: Green's media hype was unable to hold him back, and his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprise cult success with a religious-themed album in 1979.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, were swimming without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album Rumours sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various minor solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he got a fresh start with a group of musician friends in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returning to earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
