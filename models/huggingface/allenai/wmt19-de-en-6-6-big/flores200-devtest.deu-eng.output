This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely used, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was maroon on top and light or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well developed shaft called rachis, but have other features of feathers - barbs and barbules - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used to fly, but rather to regulate the temperature or to show off. However, the researchers suspected that the sample, although the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and no chick down.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in the police headquarters of Turkish Gaziantep, killing two policemen and wounding over twenty other people.

She finished her other race, the Giant Slalom, with 10th place in the women ’ s group with a combined running time of 4: 41.30. This meant that she was 2: 11.60 minutes slower than the first Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1: 09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four women skiers from crutch skiing did not finish the race, and 45 of the 117 female Giant Slalom skiers did not finish the race.
Police from Madhya Pradesh have found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and secured her mobile phone and laptop. ”
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car rushed in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries to his head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been indicted before the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for the murder of her son.
She is in pre-trial detention pending indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be falsified as her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts have found the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when publishing photographs of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the prosecution.
According to the Leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand that the borders be reset to the state prior to the 1967 Six Day War.
Other issues supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley of ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only wants to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters of the accompanying attempt to contain the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Qualified volunteers were recruited through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Managing Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training.
Yesterday Martelly sworn in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martellys fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country toward new elections.
The Commission was Martelly ’ s response to the widespread dissident protests that began in October.
The partly violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating in broken iPods have been reported, triggering a total of six fires and four people suffering mild burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents of overheating, which the company called" not serious "."
The ministry responded by calling Apple ’ s postponement of the report “really regrettable. ”
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07: 19 local time (21: 19 GMT on Friday).
The Office for Civil Protection of the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also declared that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six dead have been confirmed.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as a maternity doctor and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his time at the hospital, Liggins began examining premature labour in his spare time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetus ’ lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said," "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman." "
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed prior to the 2010 federal elections, the proportion opposing Australia ’ s becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Temporary Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II ’ s reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent are of the opinion that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner at the Olympic Games should swim in the Commonwealth Games in the disciplines 100 m and 200 m freestyle as well as in three relays, but because of his many complaints his fitness was doubted.
He was not able to take the medicines needed to overcome his pain, as they are banned from the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science institute professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets were possibly a source of water supply for the Earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and enable life.
As comets collided with the Earth long ago, scientists expect to gain insights into how planets, especially the Earth, form.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill to legalise same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and foolishness."
It is speculated that he could run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional means of transport and the above ground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no on-site parking or park and ride-and-ride facilities available.
With the concern about the lack of transportation possibilities, the probability grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed within only two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process lasted much longer due to mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled to leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called illuminated manuscripts, in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its colour depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which their electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo are said to have a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that visited men and women in mixed company.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was transported into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our gaze somewhat.
A gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet is needed to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bike has changed the world incredibly, and the biggest service it has done us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railroad, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has and which ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called packs.
The herds consist of one to three relative adult males as well as up to thirty females and boys.
Women usually have a close relationship when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act similarly like wolf or dog herds, animals, that surprisingly resemble the lion (but not other big-cats) in the behavior and are just as deadly opposite its loot.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not particularly well), swim, jump large distances and pull with the five-fold strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (type Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones, that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of growling roared words.
Ocelots eat small animals. If they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he himself.
Scientists think that ocelots track down animals for food (prey) with their sense of smell. They sniff where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by optically adapting to their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (e.g. when they cross a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adjustments to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food via the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. We mainly feed on plants. Animals could not survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal to cross its path.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs and might even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that got into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was not up to it.
While most of their food is known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs, whereas the rich men preferred to have banquets together, at which they were lying on their sides while eating their meals.
Dishes of ancient Rome could not contain food that in later centuries came to Europe from America or Asia.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes, nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was regarded as the house of the god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods and the priests tried to correspond to the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were erected as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not of such great importance.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard. Shops simply consisted of shop counters open to the street. Stone was used for building the house.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse legends say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But, regardless of its discovery, Eskimo ’ s tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "The Legacy of the Knights Templar", you may think that a treasure map has been drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776", the text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although nobody knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29 ¾ inches x 24 ½ inches) was rolled up for safekeeping at the beginning of his life.
It is therefore possible that the label was simply added as a label.
The D Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was dominated by the" Vichy "French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also somehow defines the greatness of a society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and adequate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as real civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggle, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the federal treaty, consisting only of Congress.
Congress was not empowered to levy taxes, and, because there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the state authorities, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
He also had no authority to repeal tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Cup winner in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motorsports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
"Because of the cluster / group of islands was Japan, Japan is geographically often referred to as" "archipelago" "."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a branch in southwest Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the native grain cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644 - 1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, the Qing Dynasty ’ s government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945, following its defeat in the First Chinese War (1894 - 1895).
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format in the world is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but even more important is that its image format has been adopted from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strictly speaking, the 35 mm format confusingly measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3: 2.
Many common formats (APS, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked third rule is a simple policy that creates dynamism while maintaining a level of order in an image.
It says that the intersection of the lines that divide an image vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
In this period of European history the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together, despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence ruled everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that assets should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the churches exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was complied with.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting the country off from vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated universally accepted international law, codified by several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters in order to prevent ships from penetrating entire sections of the sea, posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unfettered under-boat warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to join the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different ages, with each period in China and each family in power having its own dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the three kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to one ruler alone.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of class, the army now based rankings on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very much interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed ’ s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if you know that it exists. As soon as you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The pyramid of Khufu is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built in the third century BC by the Egyptians, the Khufu pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to worship deceased pharaohs.
The Giza or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were erected in honor of Khufu ’ s wives and family members.
The "Spread" symbol looks like a V and the "Smear" symbol like a bracket or square, where the bottom line is missing.
Up means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Down means that you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The application usually generates a softer sound, while the stripping is stronger and more expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed bow markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be respected.
King Louis XIV panicked, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two young children (11-year-old Marie, Therese, and 4-year-old Louis, Charles), and the King ’ s sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women at Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who uttered threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
Sometime a member of the enraged crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the eyes of the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the U.S. imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover the bulk of their expenses, and the interest on bonds flowed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits stemming from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history spanning the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000 + AD 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which unanimously ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad spectrum of ideas in practice, from technology, or the technological imperative, to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than social.
It can be said, for example, that cars inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new health care techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures related to this geography emerged and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today ’ s world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicentre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of the fashion capital of the world moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th century and the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, styles in the West lag behind 25 to 30 years due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that people began to use buttons to fix clothes as a result of the Crusades.
The economy of need is agriculture, which aims to produce just enough food to cover the needs of the farmer and his / her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic crop that uses saved seeds native to the ecoregion and combines them with alternating field farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished from others in terms of age, ethnicity, class, place, and / or gender.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical, or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their affiliation with a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse during childhood.
"Such children are called" savage "or" wild. "Some overgrown children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's neglect was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before being exposed or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by animals, the ferocious child exhibits behaviors (within its bodily possibilities) that are almost entirely in accordance with those of its specific foster animal, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process simpler and more interesting, "scaffolding" goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a novel learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are built into the software and are intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle on his own.
Children are placed in foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to.
For us, the foster care system is a piece of safety for these children.
Our foster family system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster home is intended to cover all the needs that they did not receive in the home from which they were previously taken out.
The Internet connects elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important findings for the interpretation of micro-expressions, face movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can see if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President ’ s Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand language due to brain damage can still judge people ’ s honesty.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as human to meet its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and pulses, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins, which contain all essential amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way as chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of purposeful waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep short time (10 to 60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without awakening you completely.
If you are someone who introduces the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before going to bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person possesses correlates in the opposite way with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the available life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini ’ Yoga, Kundalini ’ energy is awakened through yoga ’ s poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the centre of Tibetan meditation is the god ’ Yoga. Visualizing different deities purifies the energy channels, opens the chakras and creates the enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course and the culture led to countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and in reality, through proxies, would deploy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On 17 September 1939 the Polish defence had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and redeployment along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans became obsolete almost overnight, however, when more than 800,000 Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet Union ’ s Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The navy ’ s role has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to carry people and goods, while impeding the enemy ’ s ability to carry people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II, in which Americans tried to bring staff and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain, just like the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were domesticated in the Zāgro Mountains in Iran some 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals in order to easily get at their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures. Goats were looked after by herders, much like the more well-known herders, often children or adolescents. These pastures are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, tracks were built in England.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early on in order to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, it became clear that rails that carry a band of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known way of moving was walking. Two million years ago, man began to walk upright with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
Its predecessors, the Australopithecus, were not so regularly upright.
Bipedal species can be found in the fossil record of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
In many cases, this is merely symptomatic treatment. However, if you do not want only temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is indeed obvious that the world has changed a great deal because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of human beings.
Following its approval by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap ’ s printing office a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap "broadsides", which still exist, are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that have survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and run on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that they cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of poisoning by swallowing can be the presence of an open container containing medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both predatory bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are some 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple can decide that it is not in their own interest or that of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can take over the parenthood.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works with the help of the scientific method, which is indeed the basis of most scientific research.
However, it is not only about experimentation, where an experiment is a test that serves to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in the physiology and the behavior are often based to the substantial part on the presence of body-own cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Behaviors determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that execute oscillating cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey / Chase experiment was one of the major indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to incorporate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the phage ’ s DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have various effects, depending on the type of mutation involved, the meaning of the piece of genetic material in question and whether the cells in question are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is the visit, photography and study of Orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose job is in the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle service, everyone is, in a way, linked to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone takes part in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such abuses, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, because you can not predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be represented mathematically roughly.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and sex partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold back their wings along their bodies.
This gives them a wider choice of small shelters where they can hide from predators.
Today dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold back their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarch claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system ’ s movements.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), moved around the earth.
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans via the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon Main River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long and absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marvelled at the monuments of their ancestors, who were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman, Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to man since ancient times, since they can all be found in their original form in nature and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also put forward the theory that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe in its entirety consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the point at the end of this set.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, the pencil has receded into the background with the advent of new writing methods, so that it has been pushed back in its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a sharpener.
One can be curious, what will become of the keyboard, if something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to compose a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. If the core is split again, a part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate at little or no impulse.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the Mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the closer side there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content-related theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and / or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment cause them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow ’ s Theory of Needs and Hertzberg ’ s Two Factors.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, one end of the spectrum being the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, disciplining, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and engaging employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and make everything their own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by the local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The" invisible team "is the leadership team to which each member reports, and the invisible team sets the standard for each member.x"
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? Innovation is a goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of responding to customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum “concept ” as a method to help organizations become more powerful.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Thus, they narrow down the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as traumas, injuries and tumours, affect behaviour and lead to changes in some brain functions.
Newly emerging technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us to understand the processes in our heads.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves the manufacture of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, setting strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines focused on finding solutions to real life problems.
Today, the system is widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is out of the question.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution, allowing students to view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students of the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students ’ writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blog experience, that usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires students to write wisely and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far beyond traditional school days.
Appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and present their own perspectives on particular topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada ’ s enchanting bilingual capital and is home to a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada ’ s past and present.
Further to the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north the unspoilt beauty of nature spreads throughout Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more characterize Ontario as what outsiders regard as typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the USA than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belonging to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Also wearing a ring is helpful (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should recognise that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider an assault, and that it is not unusual to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences back and forth; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
Today ’ s Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinid as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to give it up after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a whole range of Tinnef are sold, but that is all just for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from Nyiragongo, a volcano that buried most of the city ’ s streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to see the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese francs for the short ride.x
This, in combination with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, it is now an impoverished city.
In 1990 it was added to the World Heritage List due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gates PBS ’ s special “Wonders of the African World ”.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country ’ s cities, because it has an Arab flair rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km ² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the figurehead of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entry fees.
It may also be worth buying a wild card that grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the centre of attention for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar chart visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island ’ s urban fabric is crowded into newly won land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists made their own. If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and extend over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km ², of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are 400 Bengali King Tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses run all day from the cross-district bus station (across the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar / Bumthang, leaving between 06: 30 and 07: 30.
As the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.x
Shared taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guyana.
Its two towers are 83 metres high, its length is 378 metres and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 metres.
The overhead clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not cleared for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017 and the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed by then.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited today's eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, who also practised subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived hunting, collecting and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly called the Greater Province of the West Indies, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Information about competitions and points of sale for polo tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island located in Stanley across the street from the FIC West Store.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and at Stanley. Even US Dollar are often accepted.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on the remote islands, but British and US currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance as to which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to change the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months temperatures above + 30 ° C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry periods: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the sight of humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to instructions from the park authorities, visitors should keep at least 100 yards / meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards / meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, moose, bears and practically all large animals can be, it can happen that they go over to the attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don ’ t keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them plenty of room.
Also, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking highly fragrant food and make sure you keep your storage clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of an inglorious stalemate of the navy in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau Movement ’ s struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland has two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade, which is donated by Pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the harbour of Waitemata, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The main local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing, and the other local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better tolerated.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are worried, you can find bottled water easily.
"For Australians, the idea of coffee" "Flat White" "is foreign. A small black is" "Espresso" ", cappuccino is topped up with cream (not with foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place all year round and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
However, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Dice jellyfish occur near the beach and near river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he or she will have a place to stay at the destination upon arrival.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.x
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also withhold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or requests should be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival visitors decide to camp locally, and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that on parts of the festival, music is played late into the night, even though the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the breaking of ice causes quite terrible noise for the most affected.
The cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually try hard to keep guests on the spot for as long as possible and to let them spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests happy and make sure they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players realize how important it is to remain sober.
If you want to ride at high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, adhesion is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility may also be impaired by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted for the most part throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in common usage refers to a journey by land to observe the overwhelming African fauna, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and the standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "shooting") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games after hosting them in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020, before the postponement has been announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the corona virus did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help with drying. Many hotels lend irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
If no iron is available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this may cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective in counteracting certain hazards.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Vermin can destroy food, cause irritation, or at worst even cause allergic reactions, administer poison, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people are not usually classified as vermin.
Duty free shopping is the possibility to buy goods that are exempt from duties and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country is heavily taxed can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo, Pittsburgh highway is probably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp curves predominate here.
The specified speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35 "40 mph (56" 64 km / h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite delicious. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as in the southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are widely used, with apples being cooked into pastries throughout the year and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich baked goods, then try what is called, depending on the region, Berliner, pancakes or donuts.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further attributes, it usually refers to the food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes. As a flavor carrier, Javanese prefer peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are aids for the feet of the riders hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught up in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets caught by the stirrup with his foot, he can be dragged along when the horse passes through. To keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with one heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup strap to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular, with skis or a snowboard attached to your feet and down a slope on a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "skiers", who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings with representations of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first leisure ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring with backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski touring.
It is similar to alpine ski touring or mountain climbing, but does not necessarily include it, as the latter is carried out on steep terrain and requires much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than during hiking - very rarely you will reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for several visas and pass through several passport checks if you wanted to travel through several countries.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen countries individually with a Schengen visa, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no general definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be called "antique", although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Even in the past, not all Sámi have raised reindeer on a large scale, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like. Reindeer kept them mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Although the term 'gypsy' is widely used primarily by non-Roma, it is often considered offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and imprecise perceptions of Roma."
If a travel notice is issued for the country you visit, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Storm is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disturbances or loss of life.
Thunderstorms can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of them depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water-pants and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal storms include blizzards, blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are urgently warned to watch out for any type of storm affecting their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
"An Internet search for" "course on hostile environments" "will probably display the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role play, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on wilderness survival, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning gender-matching surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid identification documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports of unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents is also very different.
The searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the aftermath of 11 September 2001.
Transgender persons prior to surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact when passing through the scanners.
Ripping, currents are the returning current of waves broken on the beach, often at reefs or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast current up to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are due to fatigue in trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you will not be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon period is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and discarded some of the behaviours of your home culture.
When you first travelled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country had to adapt.
It may not be expected that returning travelers will also require patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it is quiet before the show begins.
Usually you hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The history of sounds and light is just like a story book.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, illuminating the different pyramids.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. By 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen lake.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth, which is bisected by the Minnesota, glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, Mount Vinson, whose highest peak at 4892 m is Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in the clear line of sight of a satellite in order to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as by expeditions that require long-distance data and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on the connection to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is to study and take courses abroad.
This is particularly popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off from university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a abroad transitional year program can actually improve your chances of receiving a higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for registering for these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands - in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
For the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coasts and islands and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland. Every sixth or eighth person owns a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several whole days while returning in the evening and staying overnight on the ship.
If you only go ashore in the course of the Bordex excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of that: it is nothing other than the personal fears and antipathies that so many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes operate and what goes on during a flight can help some people overcome the fear associated with the unknown or the feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are well paid for the quick delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor for company documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies used their own aircraft, but on other routes and with smaller companies difficulties arose.
If they shipped things by air, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get through it faster was to send it as checked baggage, and the airlines' rules do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in First Class or Business Class is to leaf in a heap of money for the privilege (or, even better, make your own company pay for it).
However, this is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal Economy tariff for business and the Elffache for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in looking for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of pilots who, for the privilege of reaching their destination quickly and conveniently, are willing to pay a lot of money and charge appropriate prices.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good traffic hub.
Formerly an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, progressive and bustling business centre, located on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centres are characterised by classic red tiled roofs, the market from the 18th century and old mosques and churches, although the city exudes an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe rather than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On the cemetery there are some interesting marble sculptures of pigeons.
It is worth strolling through the fascinating village for half an hour.

The Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima - a place of world renown for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a mass gravesite and a place that is of almost immeasurable importance to a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked themselves to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect that you deserve. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only shown in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transport and other facilities.
Ordinary announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Even if this is often just an incorrect cliché, it is best to get along in Paris if you show yourself at your best and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well educated), which will make it much easier to get along.
The rude appearance of the Parisians quickly disappears if you display basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and capercaillies as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women have to wear skirts that reach over the knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are wrap skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that reach over their knees.
These can also be borrowed at the entrance from the stock, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. For all men there is a one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.

"All nouns begin next to the word you for" "you" "always with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.

The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.
"Pay attention also to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means" "dear" ", whereas carro means" "chariot" "."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to better understand formulations.
If you speak a Romance language, it is of course easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might hastily come to the conclusion that Portuguese is so similar that you don't have to learn it.
Pre-modern observatories are normally no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution at its peak was not the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university sites that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
Considering the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other aristocrats around the imperial court.

In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have been adopted throughout the world, including by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter night awake at some open spot to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evenings, during the Easter weekend, with the parish festivities often beginning at midnight, when the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or flooding.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to travel, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans entered the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the Polar Night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are common business clothing and colleagues address each other with their surnames or job titles.
Workplace harmony is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than praise for individual performance.
Often, employees must seek the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and are expected to follow their bosses ’ instructions unconditionally.
