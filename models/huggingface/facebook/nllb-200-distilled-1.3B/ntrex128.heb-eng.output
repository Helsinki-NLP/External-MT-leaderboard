Members of the Welsh parliament are afraid of looking like puppets.
Some MPs were alarmed by the proposal to change their title from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern was raised following plans to change the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are worried that this will invite ridicule.
A Labour MP said his people were worried it would go bad with the TWP and the PWP.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
Member of Parliament for the Labour Party Floyd Camry said all his members were "displeased" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his members were "open to suggestions" for a name change, but noted that the name MWP (Welsh MP) sounds very similar to the word Muppet (puppet).
In this context, the Welsh w is pronounced similarly to the way the English u is pronounced in the Yorkshire accent.
The House Committee on Names, which is currently drafting the name change legislation, said: "The final decision on any descriptive words for the names of the offices of the members of the House is of course the decision of the members of the House themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh House of Lords the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which gave broad support for changing the name of the House of Lords to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of Member of Parliament (AMs), the committee recommended the Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
Members of parliament are proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could cause considerable headache for committee chair Elaine Jones, who is due to table a draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the legislature works, including rules for removing MPs and the structure of the committee system.
It is the vote of the members of Parliament that will ultimately determine their title of office during legislative deliberations.
Macedonians are going to vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to: Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, in which there is a province called Macedonia.
Greece has long claimed that its northern neighbour is a claim to Greek territory and has opposed Macedonia's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Ze'ev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem.
According to Mr. Adams, "old-timers in the neighborhood say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner".
"Today there are no bars and no churches".
He says you can understand the disappearance of bars.
People's social lives are different now.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders expect, and that sooner or later they will find themselves back at the starting point".
He says churches will be replaced by apartment buildings with shared housing that house people who aren't the kind of people who help neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people", he says, "and that will signal the closing of these churches, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will join these churches".
Two churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black faith community that operated in the area became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's Church passed into the hands of a black community of believers under the pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the structure, but as part of the believers' plans under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they ordered the construction of the crayon of the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and heir to his position at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell the "Bells of the Poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another name: "Cultural treasure" and "historical instrument that has no substitute".
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to play the larger bell carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marivater said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's over the past few months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the local church leaders, others by the Episcopal bishops.
The assembly - the governing body of the local community of believers - wrote to the bishops in July expressing concern that the bishops would try to pass on the expenses to the assembly, even though the assembly was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some of the faithful complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy while diving to catch lobster.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he dived to catch lobster in California on the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the San Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends since about one o'clock on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then dived in with a group to help wash him up on the beach.
Hamel thought at first it was just a cry of enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then realized the boy was screaming "I'm bitten!"
I got bit!
Hamel said that when he got closer to the boy, he saw that his entire collarbone was torn out.
"I shouted to everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'", added Hamel.
The boy was transported to Radley Hospital in San Diego where he was listed as a human.
It's unknown what species of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue leader Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Cascading Creeks to Swami Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to break into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's starts out competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and develops dog shop-style aisles with professional saleswomen.
As part of a major push to penetrate the UK's £2.8 billion a year beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home products decline, the expanded range of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if successful, will be added to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as retailers are looking for ways to use shelf space previously captured by TVs, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's said the company is expected to double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain additional territory with dedicated brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The grocery chain also relaunched its makeup line - Boutique - so that most products will be environmentally friendly, a trait that is increasingly in demand among younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance chain Fragrance Shop will be testing franchises at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the second to open in Slea Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and beyond buying smaller amounts of food every day at local convenience stores require retailers to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores would become more like dog shops as the grocery chain tries to compete with the low-cost chains Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has added Argos outlets to hundreds of stores as well as several Habitat outlets since acquiring both chains two years ago, additions that it says have boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive its beauty and pharmacy departments have ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from the pharmacy within the grocery stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-branch pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain for £125 million three years ago.
She said Lloyds would play a role in the scheme, by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Sainsbury's sales manager Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We've revolutionized the look and feel of our beauty products to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we've invested in specially trained staff who will be available to provide on-site counseling.
Our range of brands is tailored to suit every need and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, challenging the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby cancelled a £11 million deal
The star of the TV show Dragons Den, Peter Jones, has expressed "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Actually, Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and accessories.
The two's joint venture is considered similar to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced her departure in an Instagram post.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a rage by cancelling her participation in the duo's luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute - to focus on her fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones reacted "with fury" when the TV star announced during a heated meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5m - left her with little time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The two's joint venture was considered similar to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's £11 million stake.
When 37-year-old Willaby posted on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from the UK to one of his resorts.
According to one source, "Truly was definitely at the top of Holly's priority list.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income for decades to come.
The decision to leave completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The company's warehouses in Marlow are full of products ready to sell".
Experts believe the departure of This Morning, one of Britain's highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in products ranging from mattresses and candles to homewear, and the potential for further delay in launch.
And it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tera Cappe, for ten years.
Willaby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
The couple spent vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willaby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Annette McFarlane as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business dealings".
It was a tough conversation.
He joked about the criticism he was getting from the news media for saying what some would call "unpresidential" and being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Said Trump in a "newscaster" tone.
"I made no concessions".
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
Instead, he says, the U.S. is continuing sanctions designed to keep the pressure on.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're in a good spot with North Korea", he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results - halting missile testing, assisting in the release of prisoners and returning the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual attitude in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed stadium, we had about 200 people standing there", Trump said as he waved his vote right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island and killed hundreds
After the Lombouk earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they didn't need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lomboc lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", Ms. Sombong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to fly to Palo, it is not yet clear if foreign envoys will be able to pass through the area.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian authorities are engaged in a situation assessment in Palo to see if more international services can contribute to the relief effort.
Given the constant earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country remains sadly underprepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami buoys were built in the Ocha region, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warning in Palo, although there was a warning, contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, travel between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was anchored in Lomboque to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
Indonesia's poor infrastructure is at the heart of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko is facing funding shortfalls ahead of his re-election bid next year.
Mr. Jokowi is also under pressure from ongoing class tensions in Indonesia as a result of the process of religious radicalization of the country's Muslim majority.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced in street battles between Christian and Muslim gangs - using knives, bows, arrows, and other household weapons.
Daniel Stridg of Liverpool equalising in the final minute against Chelsea
Daniel Stridg saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridg was handed a pass by Shaquille O'Neal when he was about 100 yards from Chelsea's goal and his team was 1-0 down.
He bounced the ball to his left and then turned the kick towards the far column.
The ball flew high over the net and landed in the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually landed on top of the goalkeeper who leaped towards him, and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time as possible", Suridj told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and I made one touch and I didn't think about it too much and I just kicked".
Chelsea led 0-1 in the second half after Belgian star Eden Zar scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue's striker passed back to Mateo Kovacic in the same game, before turning close to midfield and running quickly into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick-walk maneuver in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a nice cross kick, which led the ace into the expanse.
The forward-center ran the defense and finished with the ball in the top right corner of the net, with a left-handed kick that passed Liverpool player Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League home leg on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Viduthun in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency announced Sunday morning.
Many people are reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake that caused waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Soutofo Forou Naruhō told a news conference.
The city of Palo, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police have opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Beckenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am on Jun Street with stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling in people in the area who saw or heard anything to report it.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to urge anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something on a car camera, to contact us - because the footage may contain information that is vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
Friends who believe they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police say they are now in the process of delivering messages to relatives.
A cab driver from Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was told that police are prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
Residents are now being told it will be hours before they can return to their apartments.
A cop is heard telling one person that the entire area is now a crime scene.
A woman was seen at the scene in tears.
She comes back and says, "That's terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were spotted inside the scene and one outside.
A number of officers were stationed inside the scene as they targeted people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message on Twitter to @MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and dial 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament has become the next target for attacks on memorials in the struggle to write history.
Removing the statue would be poetic justice in light of the Taliban's puritan suppression of so many cultural and religious artworks in England.
But the Cromwell Society says Mr. Crick's proposal is "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current controversy over the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell standing outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The shattering of the statues of the English Civil Wars was not ordered by Cromwell and was not done by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is falling victim to the actions of one of his predecessors in the lineage, Thomas Cromwell, a century ago.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of the sculptor Sir William Hammock Thornycroft, is a testament to 19th century reflection and part of the historiography of a figure many still consider worthy of reverence.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was perceived by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate estimate is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is an indisputable fact that the struggle in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one identified figure representing one side of the establishment at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and glory".
A deadly pig that drove a Chinese farmer to his death.
Local media sources report a pig attacked a farmer to death in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery while covered in blood near a pigsty in the Lufenshuei market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Shenyang, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and found the door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation has confirmed that a 250-pound pig attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My uncle's legs were covered in blood and were moving", said his cousin, whose last name is Wu, as quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Evan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars and a fence to prevent it from attacking more people, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
It is reported that negotiations are underway between Yuan's family and the market authorities regarding compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband to suffer serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had strapped a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the farmer's wife ran off with the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Mitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but the taste of blood may be a trigger.
They're just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very inquisitive... They don't mean you any harm.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve, he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants will cause heavy rains over large areas of the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern Gulf Coast.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Winds in Storm Rosa reached 135 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday at 5 a.m. eastern coast time, the center of the storm is 620 km southeast of Ponta Eugena, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an avalanche is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the east coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to a quarter inch of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture that will merge with the approaching tropical storm will produce heavy rainfall over large areas of the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimeters of rain will cause flash floods and the risk of desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall amounts to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
Flash flooding is possible with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain could turn valleys into roaring rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong gusty winds and dust storms.
The approaching hurricane will bring local rains to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There could be a total rainfall of over 13mm, which could cause garbage and slippery roads.
It'll be the first rain in the area this rainy season.
Scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona Sunday evening and Monday morning, with rain expected to intensify and spread further on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may see sharp temperature changes across the U.S., with the Arctic cooling but the tropics remaining fairly warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a prime example of extreme temperature changes across the central United States.
There's a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, a prolonged bout of Keisi fever will try to develop and expand again.
By early October, temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern United States, moving between 27 and 31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures could reach 90 degrees on Tuesday, which is about five degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Bert Kavanaugh hearing
Over 20 million people watched Thursday, on six television networks, the compelling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, with news flashes in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% certain that Kwanno touched her body while drunk and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kawano, in cross-examination, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
The viewership was probably even higher than the reported 20.4 million Nielsen ratings.
Nielsen Company examined the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time measuring people watching in offices.
For comparison, this is a crowd on a scale similar to a football playoff game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which commented enthusiastically on Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest levels remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the central figure in the drama that began on Friday.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameramen as a group of protesters shouted at him as he tried to get into the elevator to get to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there looking humiliated for a few minutes as the protesters beat him, all of which was recorded live on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you", said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power whereas so many women are weak".
Flake said his office put out a statement saying that before the elevator door closed, he would say more at the committee hearing.
The broadcast and cable networks all went live hours later, as the Judiciary Committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only vote for the nomination if there was an understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee within the next week, which the Democratic minority has demanded.
Flake is partially convinced by conversations he's had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had force, because it was clear that Republicans would not have a majority to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused her critics of playing politics with Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national internet, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that appeared alongside her idea on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson went on to attack her Brexit "silent treatment" plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU back each other's tariffs was "completely exaggerated".
Police have arrested Deaton Simpson on suspicion of the murder of the LSU football player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
A 20-year-old man named Dayton Simpson has been arrested and jailed for first-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was on them, according to a report from WAFB, which is part of CBS.
After Simpson was questioned, police say he admitted to shooting Wade to death.
Bail was set at $350,000, as reported in the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Division of Pathology released an initial report Friday, stating that cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and inside the neck.
Police gave credit to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens who helped with the investigation that led to the suspect's capture.
LSU athletics director Joe Alva thanked local law enforcement for their "firmness and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-2 basketball forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, his average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked and shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what they're afraid of all the time", Wade said.
A volcano spewing ash over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican residents on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity on the mountain's crest increased and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded in 24 hours.
Downtown, we've got a lot of noise and tremors.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the sunsets of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Suchimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity at the volcano located 72 km (45 mi) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Gyu, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police forces to disperse the demonstrations, and thousands more joined the demonstrations against the first anniversary of the party's vote on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists who were brushed by the police to disperse the demonstrations, threw eggs at the police and sprayed paint powder, creating black dust clouds in the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes also broke out later that day when police were forced to use machine guns to overpower the protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in front of the unity supporters chanting "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remain high in pro-independence areas a year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by the Spanish government but celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become an independent state, although the turnout was low as those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
Government officials in Catalonia reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent ballot boxes from being voted on in violent clashes across the region.
Independence groups set up overnight camps on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration was held but had to be conducted in a different way.
Narcis Thermes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year was our best.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Although the Catalan separatist parties won a major, albeit decisive, victory in the elections last December, they have struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders in self-imposed exile or in prison awaiting trial for their part in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Fogg, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, said the confrontation was being encouraged by politicians on both sides of the aisle.
"It's getting worse", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Yonkers, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed from the Spanish government", he said.
Several men have been arrested after a car crashed into a house.
Three men - aged 33, 34 and 39 - were arrested after a car collided several times at a London house.
The incident occurred in Ballynaarg Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 UK time.
Detective Bob Belmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It's also possible that at some point a bow arrow was fired at the car.
Mango's kick gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Mage's first goal for Livingston guaranteed the win
Livingston, who had just joined the league, stunned Rangers and coached Steven Gerrard, which was only his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Mengele's kick was significant because Gary Holt's team moved to level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team is undefeated at home in the Super Bowl, and will face the leader, the Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their home losing streak to six games, and head coach Holt hasn't had a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed chances against a weak host team.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they took a shot, when their lead caused the Rangers various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but pulled his attempts before goal, and then Alan Litchfield could only focus his efforts wide after sliding in to meet Craig Helgette's approach before goal.
The hosts were willing to let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing they could make it harder for the home team with free throws.
And that's how the final score came.
The Rangers took a free kick and Livingston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Mango, who made a touchdown and scored from the center of the field.
At this point, the Rangers had control of the ball but found the home defense was impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained almost unthreatened.
That pattern dragged on into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the goal.
Scott Pitnam was held off by Rangers goalie Alan McGregor and Litchfield hit a wide from another Livingston free kick.
Crossed balls continued to enter Livingston's area and hold them, while two penalty balls - after a pass by the pickup on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one on a right-hander - were removed.
- Amazing. - From Livingston. - Surgery is amazing.
Alistair Lamont, BBC Scotland at the Tony MacArthur Stadium
Amazing game and amazing score from Livingston.
All the players were great, and they kept exceeding expectations in this upward trend.
Their style of play and the composition of the players have hardly changed since their return to the leading position, but Holt has to be given much credit for the way he has built the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Hulkett was formidable, leading a wonderfully organized defense, while Mango kept Connor Goldson and Joe Varal on their toes all the way.
But the Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were quite good at times under Gerrard, they didn't live up to those standards.
They were missing the final ball -- they only opened the home team's defense once -- and that's a red light for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A mixed reception for Erdogan in Kelen
There were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at improving relations between the two NATO member states.
They had disagreements on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
From there, Erdogan went on to attend the grand opening of a new mosque.
Cologne is the city with the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police announced security reasons for blocking 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters crowded nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices, protesting both Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to welcome them into the country.
The counter-demonstrators reflect the controversy surrounding the guest who some Turks in Germany hail as a hero and others denounce as a tyrant.
Motorcyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Stowwood and Evelyn streets, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15am UK time.
The driver pulled over and paramedics treated the wounded man, but the man died at the scene.
The collision comes after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
City police say officers are trying to identify the killer and notify his family.
Instead of roadblocks and buses being diverted to alternate routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Larin Prison: Six prisoners injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a secure men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at Long Larten Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 0930 British time and is still ongoing.
Special forces from the Toronto unit were brought to the scene to quell the riot, which involved eight prisoners and was contained to one wing.
Guards were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said highly trained guards were being recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Latin Prison.
Six guards were treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that the perpetrators will be turned over to the police and their sentences may be extended.
Long Lartin is home to 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the warden was receiving treatment in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October riot police were called to the prison to deal with a major riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's rare for a tropical downpour to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep across the southeastern desert, bringing with them a flash flood threat.
The National Weather Service has already declared a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday with heavy rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have remained in tropical storm or hurricane status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest Arizona Hurricane Center models forecast 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the Arizona edge of the mogul.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated locations receiving a total of 50 mm.
For those outside the flash flood risk area, the rain from Storm Rosa may be a blessing since the area has suffered from drought.
Although flooding is a serious danger, some of this rain will be helpful as the southwest region is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is in severe drought, the second-highest category, reports weather.com.
First, a path of Hurricane Rosa will make landfall across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Storm Rosa, still a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 137 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugena, Mexico, and moving north at about 20 km/h.
The storm hit colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakened.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains across parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a risk of severe flooding.
Rainfall ranging from 75 to 150 mm is expected from eastern California to northwestern Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm, weather.com reports.
Then Storm Rosa will continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The primary danger from Hurricane Rosa, or its remnants, is heavy rain in Baja California, southwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States, the National Hurricane Center reports.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening waste streams in the desert, and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Truss area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday around 0400 BST.
He was taken to the hospital where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Police are asking anyone who may have cell phone footage of what happened to contact the police.
Trump said Kwanno had suffered the condemnation and anger of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's rudeness and shocking tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kwanno "suffered the condemnations, the wrath" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blazy Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the arraignment hearing about her guilt.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the finest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president has been indirect about Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to the polls in the midterm elections.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I am, actually, he said.
And that's why I'm running everywhere to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission to resist and disrupt.
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first procedural vote in the full Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many washed up in huge waves crashing onto the shores, as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, official sources reported on Saturday.
Crowds gathered for a festival on the beach in Palo on Friday when waves carrying over 18 feet (6 meters) of water crashed onto the beach at sunset, washing many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they were victims", said BNPB disaster management agency spokesman Sotopo Forou Noroho at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it pulled cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Nuruho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at 800 kilometers (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been referred to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed destruction of a number of homes and shops, crooked bridges and squares and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful quake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said the geography of the city, sitting on the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Norho described the destruction as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Noroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-kilometer (190-mile) coastline of northern Palo, an area called Dongla, and closer to the epicenter.
The media is completely collapsed and there is no information from Dongola, said Noroho.
In an area of more than 300,000 people, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not announcing that a tsunami had hit Palo, even though officials said the waves arrived around the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be seen on a high building roof yelling hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below him.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the beach, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the photo.
The quake and tsunami caused widespread power outages, cut communications around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending transport planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials say, but survivors are still in desperate need of food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport is only open for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's very difficult.
As World Vision workers from Dongola arrived safely in Palo, where workers in porcelain shelters set up in their offices' courtyards, they passed a spectacle of destruction on their way, Mr. Dusba said.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed, he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as aid groups began the pitiful work of driving disaster relief, there were complaints that experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from reaching Palo.
Under Indonesian regulations, you can only start flowing funds, supplies and people from other countries if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
That thing's not done yet.
"It is still classified as a provincial-level disaster", said Olia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open the door to international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.
As the second night falls on Palo after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing have held on to the hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that illuminate the bleak stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy is rescued from a sink.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian parachute team, has trained two missing parachutists for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Hotel Seer Seer, including Mr. Mandy, were his students.
"As a professional parachutist, I carry an emotional burden of my own", he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after news of the collapse of the See See Hotel spread among the floating skydiving community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palo competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival.
But his messages showed only one gray criticism mark, instead of a pair of blue ones.
I think it means the messages weren't delivered, he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during a cash machine fill-up in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brynx worker filling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to bring in more cash, investigative reporter Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran after a Brinks worker and stole a bag of money meant to be filled into an ATM.
A witness saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the report, but police did not specify how many people were involved.
Anyone with information about their identities is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenya West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kenya West is changing his name to Ye.
In the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The entity formerly known as Kenya West".
West, 41, has been affectionately known as Ye for some time and used the moniker as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on the TV show Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande who canceled due to "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, when discussing the name of his album with a radio broadcaster, Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It's gone from Kanye, which means the one and only, to just Ye -- just a reflection of the good in him, the bad in him, or the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of a few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately as Puff Daddy, Pee Daddy or Didi, but this year he announced he preferred the names "Love" and "Brotherly Love".
West's former partner, Jay Z, also switched between the uppercase and lowercase versions of his name.
The president of Mexico has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
Army forces fired on a nonviolent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
With China's increased AI activity, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI research, says AI researcher Kai-Po Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after various parts of the US government issued statements about AI, even as the US government has no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI", he told me.
Doubling up on funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be achieved in the United States, he told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in China's most prominent AI company, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the number one ranked reverse player in the United States, and later served as a senior manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
I was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, and asked when you'd be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
"It's not China that takes our top researchers from academia, it's corporations that do it", he told me.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years recruited university stars to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the Arabs strengthen their efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that a green card should automatically be offered to a PhD in AI", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its next-generation AI development plan.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide research grants in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, I'm told.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint AI center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special AI committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an AI initiative called AI Next.
And as for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a legislative initiative in the United States to create a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name is a claim to Greek territory and vetoed its membership in NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Serb-majority population.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is worded as follows: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Those in favor of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Ze'ev, argue that it is a price worth paying so that Macedonia, which is one of the countries that was created from the breakup of Yugoslavia, can join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a safe life for all of us", said Olivra Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the results of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no irregularities as of 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of eligible voters turned out to vote.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Josja Tanbsky, voting in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zeiv, his wife Zurika and son Dushku Lelouch read their ballot paper in Stromitsa, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which would open the door to its accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavdarkov set up a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join upright, not through the servants' entrance", Kavderkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union.
Prime Minister Zeev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zeev said after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be "a guarantee of our future".
A poll released on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, the voter turnout must be at least 50 percent plus one.
A referendum failure would be the first significant loss of pro-Western government policy since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like Aguero was taking the gate with ease.
The Argentine starter got a pass in the middle of the field early in the sequence.
He ran through three of Brighton's defensive players before breaking into the open field.
At this point Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one guard before scoring a run for a few more on Brighton's winning margin.
Then he kicked a left-handed pitcher, and he found Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch on the field to hand the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-footed kick beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a ball to the right of the net.
Jaguar has problems with his feet, Manchester City manager told reporters.
We agreed he'd play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he got a goal in that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Devils the starting lead in the Super League opponent.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's court during that.
He sent a great cross ball down the right wing to Leroy Sana.
Sana'a spins the ball before leading Sterling to the far column.
The Blue Devils player pushed the ball into the net just before he slid off the field.
Manchester City will face Motahyam in their Champions League home game on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rheincar Stadium in Zinsenheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scharzer hopes to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it still has playoff implications for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned themselves an open card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're not yet guaranteed first place at home.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the spectators and the other team will play at the highest level probably at any point you face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to deal with it?"
The Nationals haven't announced their starting lineup for Sunday, but reports are they're inclined to let Schrader serve in this situation.
Scharzer, making his 34th start, practiced from the bench on Thursday and pitched on his day off - Sunday.
Washington's right-hander has an 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
The president indirectly hinted at the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming to the polls in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the most, most - I'm not running, but actually I am running, which is why I'm running everywhere and fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And if you're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the condemnations, the abominations.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control, that's what they want is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats are, he says, on a mission to resist and disrupt.
And you've seen that over the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats "angry and evil and vile and dishonest".
He mentioned by name the minority leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which drew high cheers from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, oh no, I waited until -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a floral place.
She has no tolerance for people who express their opinions.
When the momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome - and only because we expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, got the same treatment because she was so vocal about anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me was a rebuke for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe -- most ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
The committee on Friday's East Nottingham Labour Party meeting said: "We want the meeting to be informative and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the general committee meetings on Friday nights were just like that.
Unfortunately today, that's not the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of a "kind, gentler" politics has long been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party is intolerant of differences of opinion, and that every opinion is judged on its acceptance by the party leadership.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected party leader, when colleagues who I thought we had similar political views with in the past began to expect him to make a perverse turn and take positions that I would never have otherwise agreed to - whether it was on national security or on the single European market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there's an immediate barrage of abuse on social media with calls for rejection, condemnation of center-left politics and calls that I shouldn't be in the Labor Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of racial abuse every day but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels have become a common issue.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is we're already in the same pluralistic place, and with every no-confidence vote or change in election rules, the party becomes more of a problem.
Over the last two years, a lot of people have advised me to shut up, not be so loud and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, upset by the Thatcher government's neglect that nearly brought down my public school classroom, I've been looking for ways to fight for better social services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could possibly be confused about my political positions and my issues with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the resolution on Friday, all I have to say is that at a time when the country is crawling towards a Brexit that will hurt our families, our businesses and our public service, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But really the one message I have is not to the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of expulsion or political expediency will deter me from acting in a way that I believe best serves the interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Air 38-17 from the Rose:
The last two rounds have slightly skewed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win today's entertaining and wonderful Scottish Premier League game.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the decade.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as taking a lot more risks, that played in favor of the home team, and coach Peter Morsi had every reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I must be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose Group said, "Laire deserves all the credit, they took better risks than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, passed by Fraser Climaud, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes who was released for the game by the Warriors allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Baggott caught the non-homer try.
Climo raised Eyre's lead with a foul, before in the first half, he scored and then traded Trey Solo for a 17-5 lead to Eyre in the second half.
But Melrose opened the second half well and Patrick Angerson's three, passed by Goat, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Roderick Knott, who was taken off the bench, and starting from the restart, Ayr widened the gap through a try by Stafford McDowell, which was passed by Climo.
Air Vice Captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and once again Melrose took advantage of the other man with Bruce Colvin's Trey non-Homer, ending a string of massive stresses.
But the home team recovered, and when Strawn Hutchinson got a yellow card for a no-ball Klimos attack, from the penalty area, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Eyre's forward mound.
Clemmo Hymer, as he did again almost from the return of the game, after Kyle Roy aced a box kick by David Armstrong and sent wingman Grager Henry to the home team's sixth tray.
The star of Still Game seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to move into the restaurant business after it was revealed he was listed as a manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Humphries.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the show's final, and it seems that Kiernan is planning for life after Cryling.
According to official records, he's the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source with the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for ways into Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, landlocked, hopes the court will open a path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the Navy headquarters surrounded by a handful of ships in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to sue him back".
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century still lives on - as does the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may have been in the air for decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and it is obviously looking forward to a positive attitude", said Roberto Cazadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be relieved by the International Court of Justice's decision on large screens across the country, hoping the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's demand that after decades of interrupted talks, Chile be obliged to negotiate for sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic native president Evo Morales - facing a contentious re-election bid next year - is facing a lot of decision-making on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But commentators say the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and even if it does, it won't make much difference.
The UN court sitting in The Hague has no authority to grant Chile territory, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ICC's decision came only six weeks after the summary arguments were heard suggests that the case was not complicated but that Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert in international law, was.
And instead of furthering Bolivia's claims, the last four years may even have weakened them.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current government in Bolivia", Zarata said.
Morales' war rhetoric wiped out any remaining goodwill on the part of Chile, she said.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodriguez Valdez, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a great opportunity to usher in a new era in relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of conflict for the benefit of both sides, he said.
Cazadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political lever.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can give the United States confidence
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, has said that his country will never dismantle its nuclear weapons first if it cannot give confidence to Washington.
Ri speaks Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the Arab world to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reopening diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that have reached a deadlock more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "dream in a bottle" to think that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance to declaring an end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
The United States is afraid to agree to a declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps to denuclearize.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, which it likely sees as the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris unveils the new trend in giant hats that are making their way to high-end stores everywhere
We'll find the solution for anyone who wants to expand their hat collection or get total sun protection.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a line of huge, crazy headgear for their SS19 collection, in a fashion show that rocked the Paris Fashion Week scene.
Clearly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have brought their extraordinary creations onto the fashion show circuit.
Valentino's signature item was a beige oversized hat with wide feather-like edges that covered the models' heads.
Other frozen-sized accessories included ornate aprons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples - but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of odd masks - check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks included sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than a hot-couture.
One piece mentioned a diving mask including a snorkel and glasses, and another looked like a melted ice cream mug.
And for those who want to continue with a huge fashion statement - their time has come.
Fashion commentators are watching giant heels make their way to high-end stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after La Bomba, the straw hat with a half-meter diameter rim that is seen on everyone's head, from Mariana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label behind the highly impractical hat that flooded social media spawned another big piece on the track - a straw bag almost the size of a bathing suit model who wore it.
A soft-colored burnt-out bag, with a soft-colored rim and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacqueline La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and big seacoats to hit the high-end stores next summer - because the design made a huge impression and it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with another set of exceptional test scores, which is bolstered by individual and group success in sport, the arts, music and other areas of community performance.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, careers of their choice and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that is able to design and incorporate a personalised curriculum, we find that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a sought-after area of study in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes into their head.
If you talk to a man in his own language, it goes to his heart".
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the last tests this year, you can see that languages are at the top of the charts with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved high A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved high A's in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, the field of languages as an elective is considered to be on the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Council found that among the reasons employers cited for coding to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a vital requirement to prepare students for future careers.
Given the increasing demand for languages for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person in a position of advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient for conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage of speakers, 15 percent.
That's why it's important to invest in language teaching for children today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for Britain looking ahead to the 21st century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what the child's field of interest is, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a team of teachers who specialize in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, in any foreseeable future.
It cannot be denied that today, in a global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the future of a country, and so this fact must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages are to be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to the children of Scotland.
It's the order of the hour.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is scheduled to make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who were waiting to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But it's not yet decided how many minutes he'll play.
It's going to be more than one and less than 48 cents, says the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career I don't need preseason games to prepare", he said.
Trump's rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump opens a flurry of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, Virginia.
This is the first of five planned stops by Trump this week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While you've voted to confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online and streamed live on YouTube.
Trump will likely refer to the hearings this week for Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh, which have become tense around sexual misconduct allegations and the subsequent postponement of the vote in the Senate for a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main purpose of this wave of stops is to help Republicans facing a challenging election in November get some momentum.
So President Trump's campaign said the goal of these five rallies next week is to "make volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president is willing to visit as many states as possible as the busy election season gets underway", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The rally tonight, scheduled to take place at West Bank Stadium in Wheeling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract press coverage from the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News estimates.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to try to improve his polling", said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows willingness to fight to keep hope alive for Sunday's singles
After three one-sided draws, Sunday afternoon's quarterfinals may be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
The momentum-driven swing is a completely made-up sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, and never more so than in competitions like this.
So where do they think we're getting the momentum now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so you can see a little momentum", said Spitzer at the end of the day.
Europe ahead, of course, four points ahead with 12 to play.
But the Americans, as Spitzer says, feel they have some spirit in the sails, and they have a lot to cheer for, not least in the form of Spitzer and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and each of them is boasting three points out of four.
Spitfire was lethal from the T to the Green and he leads by example.
Cheers grew louder as his round went on, as he sank a critical Pat to win the all-square four and Thomas went down two after two.
His Pat who won the 15th game earned a similar shout-out, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
"You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own game", said Spit.
That's all any of these players have left to do.
18 rubbers to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spitfire and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup lead.
The strange but charming pair of Europeans are four out of four and are loved by all.
"Hollywood were the only couple not to shoot the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd, establishes the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to sign the potential European win as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
It's better to have both at the same time in different colors.
However, it's too early to talk about European fame.
Bubba and Tyson Webb Simpson finished off Sergio Garcia, this morning's hero of the Four Bullets, when he robbed with Alex Norn.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine dropped the Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they never got close to getting out of.
However, on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of the pit.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four balls and the fours because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe have been playing better as a team so far and are leading significantly towards the final day, but this quarter-final showed that the US team is full of fighting spirit that some, especially within the US, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe is in a healthy lead heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Wrencesco Molinari led the change with two wins over challenger Tiger Woods, raising the gap so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to defend the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the Americans who missed four ball games this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The Americans showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but couldn't close the gap.
To keep the trophy, Jim Furyk's teammates need eight points from 12 games.
Fleetwood is the first European turkey to win four straight points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Hollywood" after an exceptional weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid in the four-ball games, they continued in wonderful harmony together to defeat the weakened Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambeau by an even more impressive score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, has shown random bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of 29 games of four-ball and four-quarter, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals to beat 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, not all went smoothly for the European players in the pleasant weather and the gentle breeze that blew southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a thrilling 2-1 victory over John Ramm of Spain and Ian Poulter in the Four Ball games and later came back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the Four Ball games, after losing the first two rounds.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a negative four-point gap to the singles, though as cup holders, Furyk's men only need a draw to continue holding the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that "by no means" will it unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister declared on Saturday at the UN that the continued sanctions deepen its distrust of the United States and that there is no chance the country will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to develop any more nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national defense and under such conditions we will by no means first unilaterally disarm ourselves of nuclear weapons.
While Sheri echoed North Korea's well-known complaints about the US's opposition to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, that North Korea would be rewarded by taking gradual steps, his statement seems significant in that it did not rule out the brink of denuclearization, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to act towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The US also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The group insists on "nuclear disarmament first" and increases sanctions pressure to achieve its goal through coercion, and even opposes "declaring an end to the war", Ri said.
The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream in the esophagus of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the harsh sanctions deepen our mistrust".
Ri made no mention of plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US president had highlighted in his UN speech earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the other side of the denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that a North Korean missile attack on US soil was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened total destruction of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no set time frame for that, adding that whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue with determination and without pause until we achieve complete and verified final nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but hours later North Korea denounced him for making "gangster demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear facility if the United States took "corresponding steps".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he was interested in included security guarantees that Trump had pledged in Singapore, as well as changes toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning by staying up all night on caffeine.
An academic study found that students at the world's number one university often have no idea about the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kessler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after a lecture he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Breyer, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health services at the university, said the university decided to open the course after discovering that students had suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sportswear and books - to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleepwalking routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Afterwards, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know this won't change student behavior overnight.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes", added Professor Schiezeler.
He said the culture of pride in "sleepless nights" still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are making the problem of sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Taking care of adequate sleep, and good quality sleep, should be every student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep sends the brain into a starvation mode, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Schiezeller design the course after attending one of his classes his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course lit his eyes and motivated him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Zeisel recommended that students consider setting a clock to ring when it is time to go to bed, not just when to wake up, and to be alert to the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt circadian rhythms and thus cause sleep problems.
Mango's goal decisive to Gerrard's players
The Rangers suffered another attack of losing in the away game when Dolly Mengele led the rebellious Steven Gerrard players to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox players were hoping to pick up their first away game win since a 1-4 February victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager and left the team eight points behind the toiling Hearts at the top of the Scottish Premier League.
Mango was on the offensive seven minutes into the half and it didn't look like the Rangers' discouraged players would even up.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston are climbing to third and just behind Hibernian by a goal.
And he may be waiting for another Ranger Double after quarterback Callum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown at him from the stands.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the team that went through to the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia in Copenhagen.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same 11 Livingston players who took a point from the Hearts last week, and he could have been satisfied with the way his players were holding up the opponents in every situation.
The Rangers may have had the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They almost got it in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Patman who kicked into Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick from Keegan Jacob found Captain Craig Chalket, but his defender Alan Letoy could only kick out of the net.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final quarter.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have been awarded a foul after a quarter of an hour when he and Steven Willis collided, but referee Steven Thompson raised against the Colombian's excesses.
The Rangers managed to kick only twice in the first half but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily blocked the approach of Lasanne Kulibally and the weak kick of Obi Agaria.
While Livingston's 34th-minute opener was against the grain of the game, no one would deny they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to deal with a deep free throw by Jacobs.
Scott Artfield did not respond as Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool passing it to Mango for a simple finish.
Gerrard made a halftime move when he replaced Cooley with Ryan Kent, and the substitution had almost immediate effect as the full-back/winger delivered a shot to Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston kept forcing the home team to play exactly the kind of game she liked, with Litchfield and Pickett continuing to throw long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor was well positioned to prevent a Jacobs attempt before the tail was blown out of the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton was later charged with another offense against Jacobs, but Thompson again ignored.
Widow: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now to the Sunday Morning widow's page: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continuing... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geier developed a method that detected and measured radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger counter.
The device has since become a landmark in science, but in 1950 it also became a pop culture landmark thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado", which starred Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as two oddball cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that thing?"
This is the Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the headphones, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on atoms in minerals".
Oh, my God, it's really popping now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on after him.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see cancer cells and kill them
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, and replacing the cells in the lab
Then the cells can see a protein that's common to many types of cancer and then they're injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the lab so they can detect a protein called HER2 that's common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "prevents the development of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon, explained Professor Berzowski.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kenya West burst into a pro-Trump speech, headed by a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It was not well received.
Kanye West responds to derogatory calls in his studio during a confused performance on Saturday Night Live, while praising US President Donald Trump and saying he will run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, "August Town", wearing a Make America Great hat during the performance, he delivered a demonstration speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, 'How can you love Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL episode opened with a tease starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Bert Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blaze Ford.
Although the commencement speech was not broadcast on the show, the clip was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to roll on West in the commercial.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had received criticism behind the scenes about the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out on stage with that hat on your head".
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "You want to see the dark place?" He said, "He's wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love".
His remarks were derided by the audience at least twice, and it seemed that SNL crew members were embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of them telling the newspaper: "A abysmal silence fell over the entire studio".
West joins the show as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West stunned many when he performed the song I Love It while he was dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the crowd".
But the host of the news show Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "was who he was and it was absolutely wonderful".
But I chose not to reward (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's out of here.
And we are too, she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now the entity formerly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, kept the name Snoop Lion, and of course the famous musician Prince changed his name to Sgt. and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder following a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
According to the police, the incident happened in the Belvedere.
The suspect is due to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the public prosecutor's office.
The star of Game of Thrones, Keith Harrington, is attacking toxic masculinity.
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the sword-wielding, violent, medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old attacked the stereotype of the hero Matsuo, saying that such on-screen roles often send a message to young children that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he was "very concerned" about the treatment of this issue.
"Personally, I'm feeling very upset right now - where did we go wrong on masculinity?" he said.
What are we teaching men in their growing up years, from the perspective of the problem we're seeing now?
Keith thinks television may be partly responsible for the toxic rise in masculinity, because of the very masculine characters it portrays.
He went on: "What comes from within, and what do we learn from without?
What do we learn from television, and on the street, that makes young kids feel like they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think this really is one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because there's definitely something wrong with young men.
In an interview, he admitted that he would not be appearing in any Game of Thrones sequels or spin-off series after the series ended the following summer, saying that he was done with battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Keith will star in a new version of Sam Shepard's play "The True West", which tells the story of a film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that he sees meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that has happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so that way the show gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on", he said.
Rose played Yeagerit, the love interest of Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 in the courtyard of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected, according to official health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China from infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a burning issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was made illegal in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of the disease are the result of inadequate use of protective measures in these sexual relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked information about a Republican senator and defends "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected accusations that a member of her staff published personal information about three U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic senator from Los Angeles estimated that the allegations were spread by far-right websites and commentators.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters said in a Twitter announcement.
According to reports, the information released included the residence addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Oren Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the ads was associated with Waters' office and published information about a member of Waters' team, according to the Hill report.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie", Waters added.
My staff member -- whose identity and personal details were compromised and whose security was compromised as a result of these false and erroneous allegations -- was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie".
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is angry denial", wrote Fleischer.
It shows she doesn't have the temperament required of a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't respond in anger.
He can't react in a way that's disruptive.
He must not question the prosecution's motives.
He's got to be calm and alone".
Fleisher appeared to be comparing Waters' response to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate trying to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
"Great if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office has contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement regarding these false claims.
We will make sure that the culprits are discovered, that the attraction is there, and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my team members.
Johnny English 3.0 - A spoiled spy parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It's now common to look for Brexit implications in every new film with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit this revival of the action-comedy parody Johnny English series - which started somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will an ironic self-clapping about how worthless we are become our country's new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, the soft-eyed, rubber-faced, peaceful guy, got another chance to mess things up - and his name stands as a symbol more than anything that this is a wide-ranging comedy for audiences in non-English-speaking countries.
He's of course the stupid English agent, who despite his strange appearance for a slick glow looks a little like Clouseau, a little bit more Mr. Between and a lot more than this guy who contributed a single note to the delightful chariots of fire opening text of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is also originally based on the mysterious international traveller portrayed by Atkinson in the forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard, leaving chaos behind.
There's a nice minute or two in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I love the part where Johnny English approaches the helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armor, and the pusher bee rings for a moment on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his comedic physical abilities, but the humor feels rather weakened and strangely unnecessary, especially since the "serious" genre of spy films like 007 and Mission: Impossible themselves now include a comedic element.
The humor feels like it's appealing to children rather than adults, and for Johnny English, the crazy failed adventures are less brilliant and focused than Atkinson's silent-film-style jokes as Mr. Bean.
The film's plot begins when a great danger threatens Britain.
A hacker hacked into the British spy agency's top-secret Internet network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the lead agent - a small role unfortunately for Kevin Aldon.
It's the final straw for an arrogant and battle-hardened prime minister who's already suffering from the complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best to fill the role of Theresa May, but she doesn't have much to work with from the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means Johnny English, the bully at work himself, who is now employed as a school principal at a prestigious institution, but gives informal lessons on how to be an undercover spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a spy academy in the style of the Rook School.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant to Maude Pacheco, again played by Ben Miller.
Buffy is now a man married to a submarine commander, in the role of a pesky class queen on whom Vico Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service get into a terrible mess again, when they are met by beautiful Pam Patel in the role of Ophelia Voltoba, played by Olga Korilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems - the evil Jason Volta of Jake Lacy's age.
English and Boff begin their odyssey that is more of a farce of two clowns: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a luxurious French restaurant; they create an underworld as they escape themselves in Valletta's luxurious yacht; and English ignites total anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality kit to learn about the inner workings of Valletta's house.
No doubt every effort is being made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the likes and dislikes, it has the feel of children's television.
It's pretty average.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it is making a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan whereby Britons will work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company executives to pass on the savings from the AI revolution to employees in the form of an extra day off.
That means workers will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea fits the company's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supports a shift to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to enjoy the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times a policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
Labour's nominee for Treasury Secretary, John McDonnell, used the party convention last week to articulate his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to draw back power from the "faceless executives" and "price-scalpers" of service companies.
The Treasury candidate's plans also suggest that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labour government may make "reductions" based on the discovery of misconduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to add employees to company boards and to create "funds of funds" to transfer 10 percent of the capital of private sector companies to employees, who will pocket two-year dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John F. Kennedy told the 60 Minutes TV show that if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh changed their minds, they would be able to get a full-time job.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Bert Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the investigation will convince which Republican to withdraw his support.
In an opinion piece aired Sunday on 60 Minutes, reporter Scott Flea asked Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his fellow South Carolina party member.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when the blame was on him, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, decisive, unambiguous".
Graham's ring, however, appears to be carved in rock.
I've already made my decision about Bert Kavanaugh and it's gonna take a bombshell indictment, he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Bert strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
And no one she mentioned could verify that.
This is 36 years old.
I can't see how anything could change".
What is the World Citizens' Festival and did it contribute anything to reducing poverty?
New York Saturday will host the World Citizens Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars performing and an equally impressive goal of ending world poverty.
The World Citizens Festival, now in its seventh year, will bring tens of thousands of people to a large lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal - to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concertgoer must complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness for the cause of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival really been, with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of giving people free concert tickets really a way to get them to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of "clectivism" -- people who feel like they're really making a difference by signing up for a gig online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Organization says it has documented more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, pushing for a variety of different causes.
He said these actions have helped to motivate world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations as a result of its operations, of which at least $10 billion had already begun to be distributed or funded.
The group estimates that the money allocated has so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social justice on malnutrition a landmark in history", said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Citizens of the world: It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the acts to perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborah-Lee Forrester and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to blockade the sea to delay Russian energy exports.
"If necessary", Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has discovered, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russian involvement in Syria - which was, it is important to note, done at the behest of the legitimate government - would be a race to expand into new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he was quoted as saying.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
The United States is able, with our navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and if necessary to lay siege to ensure that their energy sources do not reach the market, he said.
Zinke was addressing an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed identical.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, leverage and substitution of fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a counterpart of one trick, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to increase its refined natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which costs $11 billion and is supposed to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's determined opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position drew a harsh backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Association (BDI), the leading organization in the German industrial sector, called on the Arab world to distance itself from the EU's energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", Dieter Kampf, head of the German Industrial Association (BDI), said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, said Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for president during a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and to do that, we need a woman to lead", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm worried to death about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, she said.
Warren was highly critical of Trump over the appointment of Bert Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Tuesday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' prospective voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the senator's intention to run for president.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's run, with 38 percent supporting his candidacy versus 48 percent opposed.
Associated figures from the Democratic Party who have been raised in the context of a possible 2020 presidential bid include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision in January, according to AP reports.
Sarah Palin is referring to the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump.
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on a Friday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, allows me to empathize with families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and with some of the vulnerabilities that you soldiers are returning from", she told a crowd attending a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back stubborn, they come back wondering if what they gave to the country, their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other military people, is worthy of respect".
He was arrested on Tuesday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, obstruction of justice for domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Wasilla Police spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to the new political asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to provide shelter to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filled out a "friend of the court" statement on D-Day in Washington in support of calling for a challenge to asylum policy, NBC reported.
The full name of the complainant in the suit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August was not disclosed.
She said that her violent boyfriend, Yubeni, had abused her by gang members but U.S. government officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She got arrested in Texas.
Grace's state attorneys described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are among the countries with the highest number of asylum applications in the United States, as having many problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. political asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the BIA Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for political asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal law requires that all discussions regarding asylum applications be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and the barrier the new policy places violates this principle", the statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the policy, which prevents immigrants from entering, harms the U.S. economy because they tend to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs", they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Political asylum is open to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or because of political opinion", Sessions said in a policy statement delivered on June 11.
The purpose of political asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts are desperate in Palo, as the death toll doubles, in a race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation became more difficult by the minute.
"There is a very tense feeling", said Risa Cosuma, 35, a mother of a feverish baby at a lemonade stand in the devastated city of Palo.
Any minute now, the ambulance's bringing bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, shuffling among water-sponged objects, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who suffered broken backs and shoulders, were lying outside Palo's military hospital, where they were being treated for strong aftershocks that continued after the quake.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the rubble, I think", Harris told AP, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, and then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're somewhere safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of bullying with "propaganda ads".
A week after a Chinese state newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily aggressively promoting the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Monday addressed a paid ad by the Chinese newspaper China Daily, the Iowa State's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, a claim China has denied.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the US election marked a new stage, according to US officials, in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to issue trade promotion notices, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war in which each country raises and equalizes tariffs on imports from its rival.
The tariffs, which China imposed as retaliation early in the trade war, were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Bernstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, former governor of Iowa for many years, and an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Bernstad in an op-ed in the Daily Edition of the DeMune Register, "is fueling bullying by running ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free speech and press, and is placing a paid ad in the De Moene Register", Bernstad wrote.
However, at the newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, though he did not specify which newspaper.
The Republican Party is pushing women's votes away ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh incident, analysts warn.
While many Republican Party leaders are standing with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defending him in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around the issue was particularly vivid, with most Republicans officially demonstrating their desire to move forward with the voting process.
"Things like this can't be undone", Grant Rieher, a political science lecturer at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Rieher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute efforts to open an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive movement MoveOn, in a statement.
On the morning of the 6th, protesters chanted "November Comes!" as they demonstrated in the Senate corridor, as Republicans in control of the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue advancing Kavanaugh's nomination, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a report by Mic.
"The levels of enthusiasm and motivation for democracy will break new records", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say they've been high before; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially among the floating votes of women in the suburbs and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite disliking the president, often avoid voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which broke her allegations of sexual assault of the Supreme Court nominee, analysts argued that there would be a backlash if Republicans continued to push for the nomination.
"The nomination has caused serious trouble for Republicans", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets the nomination, but also how the Republicans handled it and how they handled her", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists Democrats in the election.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about the degree of trust they place in what is said in the testimony of Ford and Kwanno, with slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony with certainty or likelihood, while 35 percent said they believed Kawano with certainty or likelihood.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Quano was definitely or probably lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as those made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to reports in The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kwanno attacked her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his penis to her during a party they attended while they were students at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, started a startup company with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project from the man who became a tech legend, is a company that will develop Solid, Burners-Lee's open source platform.
The Solid platform allows its users to choose where their data is stored and who can access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create a "personal online database" or POD.
The database may include a contact list, lists of actions to be performed, a schedule, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all in the same browser at the same time.
What makes a personal online database unique is that it is the user alone who decides who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "data-driven personalization".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea is that Inrupt will find the right resources, process and capabilities to help bring Solid to everyone.
Today the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether they'll agree or disagree to a complete change that would cause a complete and overnight reversal of all their business models.
We're not asking them for permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new grid built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he established the Web standards organization, W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as founder and director of the W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am especially optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: An event to commemorate the clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to have been awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior was commemorated at an event in his home town 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Reverend Bernard Van, was awarded the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told he had won Britain's highest honour.
The Stone of Eternity was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Bradden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that unveiling the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal was "incredibly symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his regiment across the St. Canton Canal through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
He then rushed into the line of fire and with the greatest chivalry led the line forward before rushing to take a submachine gun with one hand and shoot down three of the company.
Lieutenant-Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's deeds were "something I know I can never compare to but something that humbles me".
He and his brother, Dr James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Royal Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was "very honored to be part of the parade" and added "the strength of a true hero is shown in the support that will be given to many people".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Blater 206 and instead got Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the action of the Altor 206 and then being cut off from the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live overnight on the British Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Jaggard Musassie and Rory McDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in Britain were stunned when the story changed to Pepe Figg.
Some of them were unimpressed by the change after staying up until the early hours of the morning to watch the battle.
One fan described the switch to children's cartoons on Twitter as a kind of sick joke.
"It's a government regulation that says that at 6 a.m. the original content was not appropriate and they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Blatter, when asked about the broadcast.
- She's a good girl.
Blatter's CEO, Scott Coker, said they intend to work on their schedules to include future British viewers.
"I think that when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can solve it obviously", said Cocker.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on day A there and we can't solve the problem until day A in our time zone, which is day B in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, there were a lot of text messages between the parties, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
We're only going to have five fights instead of six, as we usually do, we tried to give the fans more and we just overreacted.
It's a matter of bad luck.
Tom Daley was feeling "disadvantaged" because of his sexual orientation.
Tom Daley, the Olympic diving champion, said that as a teenager he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation - but that feeling motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he got to middle school that not everyone was like me.
In an interview with Desert Island Discs, Radio 4's program, hosted by Lauren LaVerne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the old show, Christy Young, has taken a few months' sick leave.
On his appearance as the star of LaVerne's first show, Daley said he felt inferior to others growing up because it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, the feeling of inferiority, the feeling of difference, have been the real things that have given me strength and power and allowed me to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally figured out what his sexual orientation was.
The two-time Olympic gold medalist has become a stalwart of the gay community campaign and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on other countries to legalize homosexuality.
He spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live freely and without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Daly married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" -- he competed in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find anyone his age who had similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a white boy named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daily said his whole perspective had changed.
If you asked me last year, it was all about "I should win a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daily said his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be in the front row", Dad said.
"I held his hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not invincible", he said.
A year later, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a gold medal.
"I just knew this was what I'd dreamed of all my life - diving in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
It was also what inspired him to choose his first song - Proud by The Small Faces - which he identified with during the preparation for the Olympics and which still makes him go a duck.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday at 11:15pm BST.
Michaelson was disappointed in his performance and took the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Michelson will set a record on Oct. 1 when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade his performance so the event doesn't become a miserable milestone.
Mickelson, who is competing in the annual two-man event for the 12th time and setting a record, was benched by Jim Furyk during the Pro Bowl and two-ball foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he usually is at games with the U.S. National Team, Michelson, a five-time Major League champion, spent half the day cheering and the other half working on his game on the sidelines in hopes of fixing the sickness he was suffering from.
Even at the peak of his career, the player's performance suffered ups and downs. Therefore, the 48-year-old Michelson is not the ideal choice for the National Golf League, where long grass courses are not usually forgiving of stray hits.
And if the competition itself isn't deterrent enough, Michelson, in Game 9 of Day 1, competed against the exact British style champion, Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with starter Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans' ambition, who had lost four points in their first 12 games, had been to win the opening stages, Michelson's game could have been decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, although we didn't expect him to say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, wrapped his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it turned out and that's how we thought we should go.
He wanted to be on the court, just like all the other players.
Michelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Opening Day.
It may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which will never truly match his personal bests.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence added some intangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he's fun to be in the locker room with", he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed playing with him this week, too, and it was nice to see.
There's a lot more to him than the game itself.
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the final day of the Ryder Cup singles games could turn bad.
The Danish player started his way into the game in Valdrama in 1997, when his playmate, Sven Blåstrås, had a 5-point advantage over the Americans, which he almost lost when he crossed the finish line with a slight advantage and won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I keep reminding myself that we had a big advantage in the Waldrama; we had a big advantage in the Brooklyn game, where we lost, and in the Waldrama where we won but with a small advantage", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching a 5-3 win at the 2018 tournament both on the day and yesterday, which led to a 10-6 lead at La National Golf.
Then history will prove to me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
We have to give everything tomorrow.
You gotta get out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots show up on the board.
We have a goal, try to win the Cup, and we need to focus on it.
I said all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of the ones standing in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world.
Bjorn was pleased with his players' performance on the difficult golf course and added: "It's important to me to never be too late when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and that's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the course when everything's going well, but when you're out there alone, then your full golfing prowess is tested.
And that's the message to the players: You have to do your best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner behind and he needs to make the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing team's captain Jim Furyk expected better individual performances from his players, compared to their performances in the doubles games, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself knows both the winning and losing side during the important final days of tournaments of this type, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when the European team miraculously managed to win the final game, as documented in the film Miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Krenchow, the captain in 1999, cheered his players up for the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but I want to make it through the first few rounds, like you saw in Brooklyn, and like you saw in Medina.
When that momentum goes to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We set up our car accordingly and put the guys on the track according to the feeling we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and will face Rory McIlroy in the summit match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose the group of players in this order because I think he will be able to bring us to the finish", said Bjorn, referring to his selection of units.
The contract for the new German warship has been rejected once again.
Germany's new navy frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but it was delayed for at least a year, due to faulty systems and falling costs, local media reported.
The delivery of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the fleet in 2014, but troubling issues after the delivery blocked the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
These are expected to include a high-powered cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries, and stealth technologies, such as acoustic signals, infrared and reduced radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the newest frigates will be able to be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, repeated delays mean that the innovative ships - which should allow Germany to send troops overseas - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, De Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder since it was retired.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the withdrawal, but the German media cited a number of critical software and hardware leaks that rendered the warship unfit for combat use.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by about 120 sailors - about half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have dramatic overweight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, and is twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty software, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the team - also becomes a problem.
It was rumored to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - above the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's security committee, confirmed that today, the navy is running out of ships capable of deployment.
The official source said the problem had accelerated and worsened over time, as older ships were retired but not replaced with new vessels.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be added to the navy.
The National Trust of Scotland is listening to the secret lives of bats
A new study at a mansion in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow European bats and bats, as well as the brown Dobbinton and long-eared bats in the Inbrior Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key sites around the property to monitor the bats' activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A specialist voice analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequencies of the bats' calls and who among the species is responsible for them.
Next, a map of their habitats is drawn to create a detailed, scale-based picture of the landscape, of their behavior patterns.
Rob Dwyer, a conservation adviser for the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating nests and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by development and construction work, which affects nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, bats' ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-tracking techniques to spot insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
She has 10 trained specialists who routinely conduct surveys, nesting tests and sometimes rescues.
The organisation also established the first and only bat reserve at the Thrift Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The mansion manager, David Thompson, said the mansion was the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Tribe we have a great area for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right living areas.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other assets will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of bat checking before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as the accidental destruction of a single nest population can destroy up to 400 females and chicks, and may even wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and killing, harassing and disturbing bats or destroying their nesting areas is prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to lend a hand and help.
She said, "We have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species we just don't know what their population status is".
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The forward of the Portugal and Juventus national teams was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mierga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
The suspect then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Dr. Spiegel reported on Thursday.
Ronaldo, 33, addressed his 142 million Instagram followers in a live video hours after the claims were published and called the reports "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, said on camera the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal. I know.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Spiegel on charges they have described as "unacceptable reporting on privacy concerns", according to a Reuters report.
Lawyer Christian Schwartz said the player will seek compensation for moral hazard in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, arguably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in years.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mourgue reportedly returned to the player's room and the player allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Miorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her he was a "99 percent good guy" who disappointed in one percent.
The documents say that Ronaldo acknowledged the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mirga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but she subsequently agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "confused by revenge actions" and feared "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she now wishes to cancel the arrangement as she is still suffering from trauma from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was due to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and last summer he joined Italian club Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will forever regret losing its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Britain's business secretary, Greg Clark.
He added that the BBC interview with Toyota Britain, in which he said that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its Burnton plant, near Derby, was "worrying".
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could be job growth.
The plant in Burnton - which makes Toyota's Oris and Aventis - produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which went to the rest of the EU.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will see production stop at our plant", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Burnton.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's going to close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call "supply chain risks" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British and rest of the EU suppliers, to produce cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, and industry insiders say they could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota can't keep more than a day's worth of stock in the Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production will be stopped.
Clarke said Theresa May's Checkpoints plan, which details Britain's future relationship with the EU, is "precisely designed to prevent these border checks".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to seize the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence from Toyota and other automakers is that being able to continue to use the successful supply chain setup that we have had to date is absolutely vital.
Toyota did not say how long the shutdown would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the additional costs would hurt the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to layoffs.
Peter Chuballaris, who has worked at Barnaston for 24 years and is the president of the Unite union at the plant, said union members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that if jobs are cut, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is hanging on, may be postponed another week as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Monday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible interference with investigative proceedings by the president.
The Washington gossip has been raging for months about whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and get the president removed through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last Wednesday, he arrived at the White House, and reports were he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for the day with Trump, who was staying when Rosenstein arrived at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" fire Rosenstein but at this point the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Thursday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, and again rejected the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Oct.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "We haven't set a date yet for the meeting, it could be this week, I could see another week postponed given what's happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press.
Some reporters will question this assertion: Sanders has not had a White House press conference since September 10th.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rarity of the briefings was not due to a dislike of the TV reporters' stance, though she said: "I won't deny the fact that they are taking a stand".
She then proposed increasing Trump's direct contact with the press.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at the numbers".
Press briefings will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this many times, and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, and meetings that allow you to talk to the president of the United States will replace press briefings.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences during high-profile visits.
His own press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre performance to reporters gathered at the venue.
The Department of Health writes to EU NHS Scotland staff and addresses concerns about Brexit
The Health Department wrote to the staff from the EU, who work for the Scottish National Health Service, to express the country's gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to accommodating applications for permanent status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in the letter: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, and it is moving towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparedness for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this time can be very stressful for all of you.
That's why I wanted to come back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the team, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and the world, bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we very much want you to stay here.
Christian Abercomb undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
University of Tennessee Tigers quarterback Christian Abercomb has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Oran of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of the University of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there", Reed said.
The coaches and the medical staff gave Abercomby oxygen on the sidelines and then put him on a stretcher and took him for further testing.
An official at the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercomb was transferred to Vanderbilt Medical Center for surgery.
Harris added that there are still no details on the type/scale of the surgery and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercomb is a student-athlete and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles before he retired, bringing his season total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be liable to higher stamp duty when buying property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be liable to a higher stamp duty when buying property in Britain and the extra income will be used to help the homeless, under the new Conservative plan.
The move would nullify Corbyn's move to attract new voters.
Stamp duty is levied on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be liable to a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in Britain - the extra income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move appears to be an attempt to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's move to attract younger voters, with promises of providing cheaper housing and focusing on higher-income earners.
A stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the additional revenue will strengthen the government's drive to help those who are already in difficult circumstances.
The fee, which comes on top of the current stamp duty, including higher tax rates on second homes and rent-subsidized investments - could be as high as 3 percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new properties being built in London are bought by foreign residents, a situation that is driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot on the housing ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country - and especially the capital - have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help young people buy their first home.
He blamed big building firms for high property prices because they grabbed land but didn't use it, and he urged Mrs May to drop the caps on affordable housing and fix Britain's housing mess.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and a no-fault eviction.
He also wants to give the Soviets more power to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my term to restoring the British dream - which is that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that non-UK residents, as well as companies based in foreign countries, can buy homes as easily as hardworking British residents.
The dream of becoming a homeowner has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in harsh conditions is too real.
JR: My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving North East, currently in third place in the Premier League, three points clear of the relegation zone.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after leading St Mirren back to first place in Scotland last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I've been to an international game once and that's it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But growing up, I watched the Scotland team play in Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that drew me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team.
Sunderland's previous managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poye, and Paolo DiCanio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid to go after such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success right now will be measured by whether I can get the club back to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, there's no doubt it belongs in the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.
Ross started his managerial career just three years ago, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as Hearts' team manager.
He then helped Alloa to promotion out of League Three and lifted St Mirren from relegation to the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he's been more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Milton Academical.
It was clearly a real crossroads, he recalled, regarding taking command of Aloha.
I really believed the management position suited me better than the game.
It sounds weird because I played well, I earned reasonably well, and I enjoyed some reasonable records.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There's a lot of stuff you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with all the stress and strain at work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I've never been more comfortable with myself as an adult.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound, Sunday, September 30th, on Scottish Radio between 12:00 and 13:00, British Summer Time.
The perfect time for a pint of beer is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to a poll
The summer heat wave boosted the profits of struggling British pubs, but put pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups enjoyed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, the data showed.
Peter Martin, from business consultancy CGA, which compiled the data, said: "The significance of the continued clear weather and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup is that July was a similar pattern to June, with pub revenue up 2.8 percent, but restaurants taking an even harder hit.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales seen in June only worsened in July.
Beverage-focused pubs and bars posted the strongest performance, with higher growth from the decline in restaurant business revenue, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their situation was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among the pub and bar chains, beverage sales increased 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales decreased 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM, a data analytics company in the leisure and hospitality sector, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the influence of important sporting or social events are the most important factors in the outdoor entertainment market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales from last year would be especially painful on top of all the half-fixed costs.
The long, hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring the relief they so desperately need.
Total pub and restaurant sales growth, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The sales tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, the Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses performance data from 47 groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the benchmark performance measure established in the sector.
One in five children have social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rise in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised concerns about the advertising of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a primary account that they showed their parents.
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- has a social media account that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean primary account to show off to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that she was asking others to "lance me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Association (HMC) of independent schools in the UK, found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's a concern that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Aillie Doyle will be the athlete voice of the Scottish Athletic Directorate.
Aillie Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an external director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her rich experience at an international level over the last decade.
"Aillie has earned a great deal of respect from the Scottish, British and international athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit immensely from her coming to the board", said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I am excited to serve as the voice of athletes and hope I can contribute and really help guide sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in total, and now serves as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I'd recover or to what extent.
It was a lot of work, but I made a full recovery, re-learned how to walk, and now I do agility and speed-reaction exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!
Advertising for milk pumps comparison between cows' mothers online opinion party
A dairy company is sharing an online ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow's milk.
To mark the launch of what is supposed to be the world's first silent, wearable milk pump, the home-use technology company Elvie released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cowshed full of hay to the tune of a song that includes words like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you won't see a tail", and in case you haven't noticed, it's not spots, it's my breasts.
The lyrics go on to say, "I suck, I suck, I feed the babies, I suck, I suck, I milk my girls".
But the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the dairy industry's atrocities.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within days of their flight, someone wrote.
Elvie's pump is discreetly integrated into the breastplate.
Another comment said, "Tragmatically understandable cow and calf alike".
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?
Another comment said: "Advert completely off".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "laughing".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still a nurse.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I was concerned with its content.
It's a brilliant product, someone wrote.
Another comment said: This is a funny ad for mothers who are sucking (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like "feathers".
This is not an ad that glorifies or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women's group finds out that they've all been dancing with their discrete pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who use a milk pump say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely silent, no tubes and no wires, it fits discreetly into the breastplate, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even get out while pumping.
Anna Blarin, partner and head of the Early Childhood Development Department at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By creating a comparison between women expressing themselves and dairy cows, we wanted to put the pump and all the challenges that it brings into the spotlight, and show in a fun, relatable way the amazing sense of freedom that the new pump will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the runway for designer Martha Jakubovsky using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children in custody has soared despite the monthly border crossings remaining relatively unchanged, and one reason for that is that the Trump administration's talk and policies have made it harder to transfer children to foster care.
Usually, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they were afraid of risking their ability to stay in the country by applying for custody of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other senior household members would be required to provide fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for unaccompanied child custody.
Authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the sponsors or their dependents are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That's why we're still chasing these people, Mr. Albans said.
In order to handle solutions for the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as was accepted under previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those found not eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer these children stay in care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, and this condition may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, shelter workers and reports released from the system in recent months have said.
Counselors say these fears are overcome in larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs of a child's difficulties are likely to be overlooked, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without adequate time for emotional preparation or separation from friends may exacerbate the trauma many are already dealing with.
Syria tells the American, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouwaleh also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and will be dealt with accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the arrest.
Muallem said the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced, was almost over.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this holy war until we clear Syrian lands of terrorist organizations and any illegal foreign presence that is one.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on the soil of a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mowlem said conditions for their return were good and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that led refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return", he said.
They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned against sending aid to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
However, he stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military operation would focus on jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Victory Front fighters, who would be destroyed.
UN envoy Stephane de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee, composed of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mowlam set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to examining the provisions of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term
By this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers obviously hope, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
During what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic closing episode in the history of any presidency!
Right now, there's no sign of fatigue in the scouts.
Since 2014, peak viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show topped the cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neil Burr, executive producer of the ABC drama series, The Designated Survivor, which deals with a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Len Scobel, a veteran comedy writer and author of Only the Funny Parts:
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scoble told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike all other TV shows, the storylines coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Prue v. Wade decision, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Changing channels or ignoring them are luxuries only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you're overstepping your bounds as an educated citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of a classified study as the source for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather bomber jacket and the implications of Stormy Daniels' gruesome descriptions of, and excuse the expression, Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what it does, which feels like a reality show, is it feeds you something every night", said Brett Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of History for Sale, about the changing team at Trump's show and the daily references to it (the war with the NFL, praise to Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode or be left behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was bright out with a temperature of about 80 degrees on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was locked in to watch MSNBC, and he was recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
I remember the times when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Funds from outside sources flood the race for the closest midterm elections to Congress.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a cash crunch, thanks to a congressional redistricting that has resulted in two congressmen running for the same seat.
The district, a Pittsburgh suburb whose boundaries were recently redrawn, installed Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another Republican congressman, Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which largely overlaps with the boundaries of the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the division of the previous districts had, unconstitutionally, skewed the results in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th District ignited a campaign battle of financial blows between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March, widely-watched, special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political commentators saw an easy advantage for the Democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, and then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump held a heated meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Company management team.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United Nations in 2017, which included drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in economic aid and targeted restrictions on visas, could hurt the Central American country, which suffers from high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America cancelled an emergency conference that was supposed to focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their intention to move forward with the conference, ending all considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is currently set for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration attaches to it, diplomats said.
And three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on Bolton's behalf declined to comment on details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about the internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst, close to the government, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
They're learning history.
The next obvious thing to do may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the alleged obstruction of Trump's investigation, for which there is now significant evidence in public records.
Mueller is reportedly turning his investigation to whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attacks on our election system.
If Congress changes its control, Trump will find himself holding this body accountable, just as he prepares to face voters again, and perhaps a jury.
There are many questions here that start with the YAM and I'm not going to argue that Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices to make that will affect the length of time this fight may last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would oppose him and support the Munich agreement.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of carnage that resulted.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, and the march of democracy cannot be stopped, accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and raised speculation about his unfitness for the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
How do we respond if the FBI's recently requested investigation into Bert Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if his Supreme Court nomination is upheld despite credible sexual assault allegations and false commissions?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections and have a Congress that puts the blame on Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy will go into a long hibernation.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who had also taken over my formerly luxurious home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light candles on Saturday on the same table that carried the hook cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the chairman of the Washington-based nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics and the author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Durrance of the Rangers is optimistic for the upcoming battle in Rapid Vienna.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and know that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw against Real in Spain earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durrance from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better performances.
"It was a good point for us because Real are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could get something done and we got a point.
We could have maybe won in the end but, overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out of the standstill in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they've got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive result.
Last year was really tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but it feels good about the place now.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope we can move on now, put the last season behind us and make it.
Women stay awake because of this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about it with their families.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to make the call", said Holly Schneider, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
Here's how you can do it.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare the family for the care provided if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Use counseling and your family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Share your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find a way to pay for expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash payment to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: find an early resolution to legal battles on this occasion.
Find us a health care professional, a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and make sure that professionals honor your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also signing a power of attorney regarding your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that you pay your bills if you're unqualified.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about medications or allergies?
We've listed these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"The financial side is not the only important point, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Get the plan ready.

The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, official sources said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster caused communications networks to be cut off and officials responsible for relief could not get information from Dungalla County, an area in North Palo that was closer to the source of the 7.5 magnitude noise itself.
In Palo, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some facts about Palo and Dongola, in Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the tsunami and earthquake hit.
Dongola is a district stretching along over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in northwestern Sulawesi.
The population of the district, an administrative area within the province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The main sources of income in the Central Sulawesi province are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal area of Dungalla.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, which is mainly concentrated in Morwali, on the opposite side of the coast from Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongola have been hit several times by tsunami waves in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami wave also hit West Dongala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, known for its seismic activity and is permanently affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, North Sumatra, on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of those killed died in the tsunami.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits South Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and causes a tsunami wave that bursts on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mantua Islands, off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Fide Gayo Baja district, causing destruction and panic as locals recall the devastation after the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami in this case, but over 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily abandoned thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Truck Palin, eldest son of Sarah Palin, Governor of Alaska and former Vice Presidential candidate of the United States, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when Meena tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Private Facility on a $500 bail, according to a KTUU TV report.
According to online reports, he appeared in court on Saturday, pleading not guilty, with certainty, when asked to make his case.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanor counts, which carries a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska VA court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice for a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Retired soldier groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Thursday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communications networks are down and the casualty rate is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, shared on social media, show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate at a beach festival in Palo City when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saifov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence not carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saifov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck owned by Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in South Manhattan, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists who were trapped in his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saifov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty request, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, you can get the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury struck out against Saypov with a 22-count indictment, including eight counts of murder with the aid of extortion, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of vehicular violence and destruction.
The attack required "significant pre-planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, and describe the manner in which Saifov carried out the attack as "debased, cruel and sickening".
"Sayapolo Habibulovich Sayapov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angellini, Nicholas Klebs, Anne-Laure Dedeck, Darren Drake, Ariel Arlig, Hernan Procci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Andrew Damien Pennocco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York sought the death penalty in a case was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saifov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saifov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to hang a Daesh flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He pleaded not guilty in response to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers representing Saifov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea that would lead to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saifov's legal team has previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Prague vowed to mobilize the People's Army today during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "shudder" under pressure from the Eurosceptics - when a Theresa May Conservative MP argued he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a Birmingham rally that Britain would be out by now if Frage had served as Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May, to reconcile the Conservatives' deeply divided ranks, was highlighted by the fact that pro-Remain Conservatives joined a different anti-Brexit rally in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her compromise plan, the Chequers, on track despite attacks from Brexit supporters, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour Party to choose between her deal and chaos.
Boone said at a Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to break up with the Crocs.
He argued that Prague should be accepted as a partner and be in charge of negotiating with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now, he said.
The Member of Parliament for Wallingborough added: "I will defend Brexit but we must say goodbye to the Crocs".
He emphasized his opposition to the European Union, saying: "We did not fight in two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own rules in our own country.
Mr Boone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false".
Conservative and pro-Brexit MP Andrea Jenkins was also on the march and told reporters: "I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who took to the streets and voted for us in the first place.
Please, drop the jokes and start listening.
In a critical message to May, she added: "Heads of government keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Prague said at the conference that politicians should be made to feel the pressure if they are going to betray a resolution passed in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political status", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that you will not be allowed to escape its execution.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressure.
We call upon the people's army of this country, which has given us victory over Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.
At that moment, Remainers marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved "Conservatives Against Brexit" banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the opening of the Conservative conference over the security problems they suffered with the party app.
"These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technology possible to have an agreement like Canada Plus Plus, for frictionless border crossings and free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is completely ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering a run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running in the November midterm elections against Republican Jeff Deal, who served as co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was the center of rumors that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Halifax, which took place on Saturday afternoon, was the 36th meeting with voters in the City Hall meeting format since Trump took office.
One of the people in the audience asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and for a woman to lead.
Arrest in the shooting death of Sims from LSU
Police in the capital city of Louisiana, Baton Rouge, announced Saturday that the suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Thursday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m. ET.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed outside the Southern University campus early Thursday.
Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died from it, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade was trying to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being in the area with a gun and a shotgun on Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6-foot-2 junior played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes with a world title after the team standings awarded him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Wally Boutass qualified for the next stage ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team standings would play a major role in the race.
For the first minute, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton almost alone defending his spot in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel made the intermission first and allowed Hamilton to blend in with the movement in the competition's tail, a decision that was apparently decisive.
The Mercedes team came to a stop half a lap later and returned to the race behind Wattel, but Hamilton moved forward after a close wheel-fight that eventually forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner track to hold out without risk after a double-step at the third corner.
Max Wörstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the standings and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led for much of the race without changing tyres to get a quick finish and pass Kimmy Raikkonen in fourth.
He eventually came down to a mid-stop on lap 44 and failed to pick up the pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me bypass him.
The team did an extraordinary job getting to Dublin, Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a conference on Saturday for insisting she didn't leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech to the West Virginia convention, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and instead said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are bad and mean and liars.
"The only thing that can happen and the only good thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry and bad and filthy and lying people", he said.
When you look at the ads and the leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
Remember that?
Diane Feinstein, was that a leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't leak.
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he added in a senator's impersonation.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to reports from The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept the letter a secret as she asked me.
But the senator's denial doesn't seem to have been taken up by the president, who responded to it during the conference on Saturday night: "I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe not [leak], but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to return to power at any cost.
You see the convictions, the scoundrels, they don't care who they hurt, who they trample on their way to power and power", the president said, according to a Mediaite report.
Dundee Stars 5-3 against the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their Premier League loss on Day 1 against the Belfast Giants and won their next game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead on two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis at Wheeler.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney got their team back on track until Dwyer returned the lead to the Giants.
François Boucher kept the score tied for the Danes until two goals from Lucas Landwald Nielsen ensured the win.
This is the third defeat of the season in the Premier League for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat the Rangers 2-1 in Belfast on Sunday.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth with 3:35 left in the game from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford cooked Wheeler's goal when he doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy first quarter, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 until Matt Marquardt cooked Cooney's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead going into the first period when he scored his second goal of the evening late in the first quarter.
The home team was re-arranged and Bushar scored again a goal that evened the game at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nelson give the Rangers the lead for the first time in the game, late in the second quarter, and Nelson secured the Rangers victory with the fifth goal, scored from the half in the final quarter.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in the next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller sacrificed his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane could escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been crowned a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely takes off.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi on the day of the earthquake and caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of Palo City.
But even though many of his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gnavan Agong refused to abandon his position in the swaying control tower at the airport in Motiara Sis al-Ghoffari in Palo.
He's staying put to ensure that Batticaloa Air Flight 6321 can take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Serraet said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We got a chopper out of Calimantan's Balikpapan airport to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper got to Palo.
"Our hearts are broken to hear the good news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the Indonesian disaster relief agency says access to Dongala, Siggi and Butong is restricted.
"The death toll is expected to continue to rise as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible", agency spokesman Satou Furu said.
Waves up to 20 feet high destroyed Palo and the city will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News that ambulances are bringing bodies in every minute.
Clean water is rare.
The supermarkets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Galpand, head of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working quickly to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palo on the first day and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN is reporting.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombook, killing more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing after a plane crashed in Laguna
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after earlier stating all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to say what happened to one passenger.
The airline said it's working with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water during an attempt to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
Officials said on the day of the shooting that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all others are stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon a short distance off the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Gaines said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
"That's a very positive thing", said Gaines.
Gaines said he and the others managed to make their way to the emergency exits in the waist-deep water of the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew was stressed and screaming, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on dock improvements also helped with the rescue, using an inflatable boat that brought people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
Data from the Air Safety Network (ASN) states that 111 people have been killed in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but Air New Guinea was not involved in any of these incidents.
An analyst details the course of events on the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors proved their case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman to death in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roult from the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tillis, and the movements of the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she was killed.
According to the Calvary to Deger report, Roult said he obtained location data from a number of cell phones that showed Tallis was with Chambers the night she died, thereby covering up his previous claims.
When the data showed his cell phone was with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records showed they only knew each other for a week.
Roult said that sometime after Chambers died, Tallis deleted Chambers's text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
He erased her from his life, Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing remarks on Oct. 1, as planned.
The judge said he expects the trial to be moved to a jury trial later that day.
What is hip-hop conscious?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre and fill their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a trio from Bristol, argues that hip hop has moved away from its roots as a means of expressing political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop consciously popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common have recently been revived in Britain through artists like Akala and Oki.
Another black man?!
New York nurse sues a couple for firing her after a racist text message.
A New York nurse is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an unintended text message from a mother who complained that the nurse was "another black person".
The couple denied being racist and likened the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lindsay Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"No more black man", Mrs. Plasco-Flexman texted her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to a New York Post report, after noticing the mouth leak, Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the previous nurse, who was of African-American descent, had done a poor job, and that she now expected to hire a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal, seeking compensation of $350 a day for six months of work and living in the place she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, we don't do things like that", she told the Post on the day and added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple fought back against the claims that they were racist, saying that terminating Morris' employment was a request, out of fear that they would not be able to trust her after they hurt her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist, her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your child to someone you were rude to, even if it was by accident?
Your soft baby?
Oh, my God.
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "extortion" and said his wife was due to give birth only two months before the event and was "in a very difficult situation".
You want to go after someone like her?
It's not nice to do something like that, the investment banker added.
The lawsuit is still pending, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers were concerned that readers would not identify with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's enormous success.
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before being inspired to write the children's book Little Toy Bear, would have been bloodthirsty about the postponement of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "merry-go-round" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of the eventual success of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important friend of our family".
"He was a quiet man, not a proud man", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of him even though it's not really your fault.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a way that's pretty much it.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say hi on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called regularly and said that her condition was really bad, that she wasn't expected to last.
Jose, I got a call from Mend saying that she was gonna die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey".
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly disappearing and leaving her system.
She died sometime before that and it's over, it's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded at that moment by families and people.
I really had to hang on.
Finally, Mrs. Adnan-Lapros, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, unaware of the agonizing journey she had gone through.
No one knew, she said.
My head was bowed, and tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had this amazing sense of belonging to Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hanging themselves on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide, working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries hung posters on a bridge in Walsh with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and he killed himself at 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel like I do every day", she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Blaidney, said her son was a promising chef with a catchy smile.
Everyone recognized him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room.
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid of a chain reaction".
Ms. Davis created the cards so people would know that there was someone they could go to and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don't sit silently - you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphries, Mrs. Davis' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling depressed or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the bottom of the stairs on Christmas Day -- when the kids were opening presents he didn't make eye contact or anything like that.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they got over it: "It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Bert Kawano's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation into him.
"I thought, if we can really get what he asked for - a time-limited and limited in scope investigation - maybe we can bring an exception to the union", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "ripped to pieces" in a deep-rooted partisan deadlock.
Why weren't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters interested in the FBI investigation?
Their deterrence is entirely due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans fail to win, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to urge them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI gets his report out?
The vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea has risen under Kim
The number of North Korean exiles to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean law enforcement official said.
Park Byung-seok, citing data from the South Korean Unification Office, said the number of deportations last year was 1,127, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons for this were tougher border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the amounts charged to people smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean exiles eventually become South Korean citizens.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, where North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats migrants as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
North-South relations - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this week, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed to generally work towards an era where the Korean Peninsula is free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm first", Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Albert Kavanaugh "history", and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee "historic" and said his character did not qualify him to serve on the Supreme Court.
Plessy responded to that in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever performed like this, they would say "hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kawano emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kawano was very emotional, and sometimes almost screamed and choked when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also sharply condemned Democrats on the committee and called the arguments against him "a coordinated and grotesque character assassination organized out of liberal anger over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election".
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't serve on the Supreme Court because it showed bias against the Democrats.
"I think he's idolized himself with these statements and the way he's been going after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pellusi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh if his nomination was approved, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"Let's put it this way -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI then he's not fit, not only to serve on the Supreme Court, but also the court he's currently serving on", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pellusi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against Obama's health care reform or the Ru v. Wade ruling, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kawano avoided questions about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
"There's no reason for a hysterical, opinionated person to come to court and expect to be told, 'Isn't that great?'", Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's a harsh criticism, months and years of rage rising to its knees, and she can't express them without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager at another place, who said she cried when she got upset, but she developed a technique and whenever she got upset and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying".
I'm pissed off.
And then she just kept pulling.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are more likely to be used as an outlet for anger, in part because they are not inherently understood.
One of my most significant memories from my early career, in a mostly male office, was that I found myself once crying in an inexpressible rage, and an older woman grabbed me by the back, it was a cold manager who I was always a little scared of -- and she dragged me up the stairs.
Don't let them see you cry, ever, she told me.
They don't know you're boiling with rage.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you down.
Patricia Schroeder, who was at the time a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason she couldn't consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a decision I thought about very well", she told me 30 years later and laughed.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because she entered the campaign late, she was late in raising funds, so she swore she wouldn't run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
They think I'm getting a discount?
During her speech announcing that she would not run for office, she was so overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that was so hard on raising money and focusing on voters instead of representatives, and anger at sexism - that she burst into tears.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown", she recalled, "because of the way the press reacted to her".
You'd think I'd gotten a sponsor from Clinkes.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
- She was crying?
How a U.S.-China trade war might benefit Beijing
The opening rhetoric of the US-China trade war has been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first shot earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on important Chinese exports including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, imposing tariffs on virtually half of the goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has responded in the same currency each time, recently raising tariffs by five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against every blow struck by the United States, and it's unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will give in anytime soon.
A request from Washington to reinstate it would mean a concession to its demands, but a public nod to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to manage properly, the pressures from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term, and reduce the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the onset of an economic recession in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously indicated", said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is open to the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the war on terror", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures designed to harm their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mowaleh said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the regime will not accept conditional or aid from countries that have funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the United States team by a final score of 16.5 - 10.5 at the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when the team, captained by Denmark's Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who had been fighting for almost the entire tournament, sent his Method T into the water on the 16th hole of a par-3 and lost the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current structure in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5-4 by the lowest rated player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the number one ranked player in the world, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may be playing in his last Ryder Cup.
With a record of eight Ryder Cup appearances, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the European player with the highest number of tournament wins with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the Cup back.
"It's a team, and I'm glad I could help", Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his countryman John Ram who beat American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles on Day 1.
"The immense pride I feel, beating Tiger Woods, which I watched growing up", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and his record now stands at 13-21-3, a career Ryder Cup record.
It's a bizarre statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, only to be outscored by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find their way on the turf, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pino, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard".
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna reorganize, I'm gonna work with the AGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
