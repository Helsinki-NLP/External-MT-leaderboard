While evidence suggests that an experimental vaccine is capable of reducing Ebola mortality, no drug has so far demonstrated its ability to treat the infection.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promising results in this field, but other formal studies suggested that it had less of an expected benefit in preventing mortality.
In the trial against PALM, ZMapp acted as a control, that is, the scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other drugs to it.
USA Gymnastics supports the charter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the urgent need for the Olympic family to foster a safe environment for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, could be better served by looking to the future with a significant change within our organization, rather than withdrawing the certification.

This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (an already widespread theory) and also provides other data that fossils generally do not provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the animal's feathers were brownish on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
The find also offers insight into how feathers evolved in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed cannon, called a raquis, but if other feather-like features (beards and barbels), researchers have deduced that the raquis probably represents an evolution after these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for temperature regulation or as ornamentation.
The researchers suggested that although the specimen is the tail of a young dinosaur, it does show adult plumage and not the plumage of a new offspring.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey left two officers dead and more than 20 people injured.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a Rossby star number, related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less activity the star will have in relation to the magnetic inversions.

The work performed was basically theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made in the Saxitarian galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts its pull on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts its pull on the Saxitarian galaxy.
Scientists concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant was "extremely worrying and alarming, because of its very high mortality rate".
It is possible that some patients contracted the disease in the hospital, in Dr. Moll's opinion, and at least two of them were health workers there.
Within a year, an infected person could infect 10 or 15 of their immediate contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire TB group still appears low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large Earth caves that often maintain relatively constant temperatures, but is similar to large holes in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University Astrogeology team in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been an experience with little technological presence: voters hang themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate inside an envelope.
Once the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter enters the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter registration.
French electoral legislation codifies the procedure very strictly.
Since 1988, the polls must be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that no ballot papers are introduced at the start of the vote, and no envelopes are added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attest to each and every part of the process.

Adekoya has appeared before the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of her son.
He is being held pending charges and trial, but any evidence from the witnesses could be altered due to the extensive publication of his image.
This is a common practice in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and according to the courts the publication of the photos was potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that journalists seem to follow a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc. of suspects.
The Crown Office, which generally handles the judicial process, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment is formalized.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians demand to be based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other allegedly discussed issues include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continued military presence in the valley for 10 years once the agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to maintain that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the complementary pest control test would be closely monitored by guards, during the testing supervision and evaluation of their effectiveness.
In a collaboration between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were hired as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Park Conservation and Heritage Director for NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first operation were given extensive safety training and guidance hunting.
Martelly invested yesterday in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine people.
It's Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
Martelly responded to widespread protests against the regime that began in October with the commission.
The sometimes violent protesters were spoiled by the impossibility of holding elections, some pending since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases of overheating iPod failures reported, which have caused a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan's Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry said that there were 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling it "truly regrettable" that Apple delayed the report.
The quake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said it had not reported any damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that no tsunami was reported.
A Filipino police officer has taken hostages to Hong Kong tourists after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
A large number of hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released in the first instance, as were photographers from the Philippines.
Afterwards, the photographers exchanged for an old woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a tocologist and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began studying preterm births in her spare time while working at the hospital.
Their research showed that administering the hormone would speed up the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered the two flight recorders: the black boxes.
The fellow warriors also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer claimed, "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme, my first representative, Moon died on the night of the two moons, something extraordinary, almost like her, a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that the moon was as strange as me... perhaps even more... dear and botanical... I hope it's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed throughout the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of the survey participants share the view that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to problems with his fitness status is in the air.
I couldn't take the medication you need to deal with the pain because it's forbidden at the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and university professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever.
Several people checked the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water arriving on Earth along with organic matter that can create proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political and political".
Rumor has it that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than older ground radar technology, which allows air traffic controllers to locate an aircraft more accurately and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being offered and the subway trains will not stop at Wembley; parking and park-and-ride parking are not available on the surface.
Fears of a lack of transport opened the possibility that the game would be held if the door was closed without the team's sergeants.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the equatorial Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have noted that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is thought to have lasted much longer due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's pimp (strong geospice) and a cactious Spanish pimp (geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped in all sorts of ways. It can be rolled in small shapes.
It can be transformed into a fine thread, which can be twisted and torn.
It can be reduced to a minimum thickness and glued to other metals, and its thickness can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted paintings called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator using the juice of a red cabbage.
The color of the cabbage changes depending on the acidity or alkaline base of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the pH H) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried pods and then with clean, moist hands mold them into balls.
The humidity of the hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had cisterns in virtually every home, connected to an advanced sanitation system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sink systems were found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, waiter also existed. In Roman civilization, waiter sometimes formed part of public bathhouses, shared by men and women alike.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, when it does, it bounces back, almost immediately.
A rocket launched the satellite into space, and scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has done for us is to offer us easier and faster means of transportation.
Some by train, car, and many other means of transportation.
Beneath these are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the idea of the niche, a specialized job that every cat has assigned and prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called commandos.
The commands are composed of one to three adult males who are related, along with up to 30 females and puppies.
The females are usually related to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion commands act in a very similar way to a wolf or dog suit, animals surprisingly similar to lions (though not to other large cats) in their behavior and also highly lethal to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can jog (though not very well), swim, jump long distances and throw with a force five times that of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus as the lion, leopard and jaguar, and these four felines are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not the same as the full roar of a lion, but rather a phrase with words roaring in shouts.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can.
Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find animals to eat (captures) using their sense of smell, ulcerating where they moved through the ground.
They can see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision and also move very smoothly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come (e.g. if they cross a ridge or river, or march to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it needed to be up to that point.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it also begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that we can exhale (i.e., expel by breathing).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and we make clothes with them, and most of the food we eat is also from plants, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time and was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long growl was adorned with over 70 sharp teeth like knives, plus an additional play on the mouthpiece, which meant that nothing that crossed his path had escape.
We can't say for sure, but it's possible that he had a biphidic tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it's even possible that he was cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-rex would not be a rival to it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a slew of items for strange or unusual feasts, including quail, turkey, snails, and a type of rodent called the leyron.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate in chairs, the rich men enjoyed feasts where they could lie on one side while eating.
The lunches of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no coconut, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of this deity.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet their needs through ceremonies and festivals.
All temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests can access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were erected to integrate them as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew families was outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the shops were just open counters facing the street.
The Canaanite region lacked important forests, and timber was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated, and Norse sagas tell of Erik the Red being exiled from Iceland for murder and finding a territory he named Greenland while traveling west.
Despite their discovery, the Eskimos were already living there.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many distinctions between the people, kings, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The Search, you probably think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" appear at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, that document was kept in a large scroll (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) rolled up.
So it's likely that that annotation is simply added to the tag mode.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still under invasion.
It was ruled by the French of "Vichy". It was about Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces liberated the south of France and headed for the Germans.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a sizeable group of people who live and work cooperatively: a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, relative to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, and which also to some extent defines the size of a society.
Civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down through generations, a lasting cultural legacy and considerable dissemination.
Minor civilizations often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and do not even come to be recognized as their own.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first created a weak central government (composed solely of Congress) under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the powers to impose taxes, and as there was no national executive or legislative body for enforcing all its laws, it depended on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate.
Nor did he have the authority to invalidate tax legislation or tariffs between states.
Articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, but states took government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national team, along with the German national team, are the second most successful team in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Some popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheel hockey, and Formula One competition.
Winter sports enjoy greater popularity in the northern regions, while Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up it, Japan is often referred to geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when European navigators who passed by recorded the name of the island as ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwestern Taiwan, thus beginning the transformation of the practices of producing large aboriginal grains and employing Chinese workers who worked on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared the country a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, thus ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they were originally like.
By 1976, about 30 percent of the restoration of Machu Picchu had been completed, which continues to this day.
For example, the most common fixed image format in the world is 35mm, which was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It still occurs today, but more importantly is the aspect ratio that the digital camera image sensors' formats inherited.
The 35 mm format, in fact and for greater confusion, measures 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve gives the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Different common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are either the same or very close to this aspect ratio.
The overly widespread and often ridiculous third-party standard is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a little bit of order in an image.
It establishes that the most effective position for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had made itself rich and powerful, came under attack.
For thousands of years, Christianity united European states despite differences in languages and customs.
His dominant power in all areas affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the basic principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was Rome for a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this pillar was being fulfilled.
Immediately after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting vital civilian and military supplies, although this blockade violated the international law of general international acceptance codified by many international agreements over the past two decades.
Britain has planted mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine warfare without restrictions.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities committed during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to live in the United States of America where he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with four cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter in which Charles Batchelor (manager in his last work) recommended him to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China there was a unique method of showing the different time periods; each era of China or each family that came to power was a particular dynasty.
Similarly, between each dynasty there occurred an era of instability with the division of the provinces.
During these periods, a bloody war broke out between different nobles who were trying to get the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to take the highest place in the great Xi'an Palace.
It had many social and political consequences; for example, the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Likewise, after the Revolution, occupations were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and determined to achieve success.
The same thing happens with the military, because the ranks of the army instead of being based on class, they've become based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people of the oppressed working class from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a keen interest in matters related to the afterlife, and he often went to a cave that became known as "Hirana" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to contemplate.
That same cave, which has survived over time, provides an intense picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on one of the mountains of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy at all to discover if one knew it existed.
Nothing is seen except the beautiful sky cleared above the numerous mountains around it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built in honor of the death of the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Necropolis of Giza in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu while many of the other smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upper arco mark looks like a V and the lower arco mark looks like a grapple or square to the one missing the lower half.
Above means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, while below means you have to start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the bow usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement is more intense and assertive.
You can write your own notes, but remember that the printed marks on the bow are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a multitude of women in the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Teresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) as well as the king's sister, Madame Isabel, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and threatening the king and queen.
The gentleman forced the king and queen to keep the windows of the carriage open.
At one point, a mob member cut off the head of a royal guard murdered in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to cover most of the expenses and interest on the obligations issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the extraordinary benefits resulting from the long exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events occurred is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history comprising the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (c. 1000 to 1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by general convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impulse or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Much of the interpretation of technological determinism shares two main ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that motor cars force the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a fleet of cars, so new production methods are designed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass vehicle ownership also generates a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism contains an important element of cultural determinism, extracted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geographical context emerged, which, in harmony with the place of that society, proved better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its sound as a birthplace of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, that were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th or 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could go 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style, and one of the greatest advances of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to wrap clothes.
Subsistence farming is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic system that uses native preserved seeds of this ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and it still is in many developing countries.
Subcultures group individuals of similar minds who feel ignored by society's norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive by the age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine the differences in a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of all these factors.
Members of a subculture often patent their association through distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, acting, and gesture.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the few unfortunate cases of boys who, through abandonment, misfortune or deliberate mistreatment, were not socialized by adults when they were growing up.
Some wild boys were confined by people (usually by their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of these boys is due to the rejection by the parents of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that wild children experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others were allegedly raised by animals; some say they lived in solitude away from civilization.
When raised by nonhuman animals, wild boys exhibit behaviors (within their physical limits) almost completely identical to those of the particular animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project learning should make learning easier and more interesting, it goes a step further.
Staying is not a learning method, but a help that provides support to individuals who are carrying out a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program, or starting a new project.
Staying can be both virtual and real, that is, the master or master is a form of stay, but so is the man-shaped clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual images are embedded in software and their purpose is to question, provoke and explain procedures that could be complicated for the student to face alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, ranging from abandonment and mistreatment to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not enriching, affectionate and educational, but it does happen.
We perceive the adoption-free system as a safe zone for that girl.
It is assumed that our adoption-free system provides safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Adoption as a foster home assumes that it provides all the needs that are missing in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The particular features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the focus on uses and gratifications.
For example, learning and socialization are proposed as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to fundamental discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, millisecond-long facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect when a person lies by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how people who lack the ability to understand speech as a result of brain damage suffered, nevertheless, are able to determine sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that these skills for interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection is eliminated from the expressed variation set.
Segregation and recombination mix up and down variations between both reserves in each generation.
In the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet their existing plant amino acid requirements.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and vegetables, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods ( ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large volume of protein that integrates all essential amino acids.
All in all, it shouldn't surprise us that our ancestors solved their protein problem in a relatively similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly afterwards (between 10 and 60 minutes).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock that helps you get back to consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find that you end up delaying the alarm without waking up, you can put it on the other end of the room, to force yourself to stand up and turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, requiring you to get up to move.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life force is, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach a state of enlightenment, and the only obstacle that stands between us and that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is part of the Buddha's teachings, but these were spread by the mahayana path of love, as well as by many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, starting with Kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path to love.
Through Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is aroused through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga, through which the visualization of the different deities clears the energy channels, the chakras react and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, clashes between systems, processes and culture led to disagreement between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It continued for the next forty years and was actually fought, through representative armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and other different places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the head of the Romanian bridge.
However, those plans became obsolete overnight, when 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Russian-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is, by contrast, the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and cargo by ocean.
The function of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to move their own.
One of the most recent notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans were trying to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain the same way it had done the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to create them to get easy access to milk, fur, meat and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goats who were often young or teenagers, in a manner similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
The waggonways (horse-drawn rail cars) were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to drag them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads along the slightly more rudimentary roads of the time.
The crossings were introduced very early to secure the tracks in position, but gradually it became clear that the tracks would be much more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused a stronger wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels replaced iron wheels, and in 1767 the first fully iron railings were introduced.
The first known method of transport was walking; humans began to walk erect two million years ago with the appearance of homo erectus (meaning "electrified man").
Its predecessor, the australopitecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the sahelanthropus already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join an environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it's like treating the symptoms, but if we don't want a purely temporary solution, we should look at the root of the problem and turn it off.
It is more than obvious that the world has changed considerably as a result of humanity's scientific and technological advances and the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the over-lifestyle of the human being.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a couple of blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
That very night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the "Dunlap Flyers".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The Dunlap 25 flyers are the oldest surviving copies of this document.
Different paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
These birds have many features that are still very similar to those of the dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their back legs like T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating encrypted information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits or bits in the computer jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so general that it is impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of toxic medicines or household substances.
See the label with specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term has its origins in the classical familiarity with bedbugs, insects with a great ability to adapt to parasitise humans.
Both the crustaceans and the bed bugs are brooding, adapted to live in their own nest or that of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest or the child's interest to raise a child.
These couples can choose to draw up an adoption plan for their baby.
In one adoption, the natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine how the world works by scientific methods.
It's not just experimentation, but experimentation is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, by asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's view was accepted on all matters relating to science, including psychology.
As the wisdom of the Greeks declined, the West detached from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often have a vital dependence on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
There are documented periodic rhythms, which are nothing more than responses to external periodic patterns, in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free operation even in the absence of external guidelines.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the first to suggest that DNA constitutes genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either marked the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or their protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have multiple different effects depending on their class, the relevance of the element of the compromised genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline.
Only mutations in germline cells are likely to be passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-centric tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural spaces to enjoy the landscape as well as the fauna and flora.
Examples of activities in situ include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, as well as the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small rural villages to their workplace crossing paths with others whose workplace is the same place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation launch service everyone is somehow connected and supports the transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science today shows that this massive coal-dependent economy has changed the biosphere of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two billion years.
We all participate in society and use transportation. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, we rarely hear a similar level of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate these kinds of complaints? Why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there some other more basic problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of particular drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they maintain with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within reasonably consistent margins; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be made up of a rough mathematical representation.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help to plan and design traffic services operations.
Insects were the first to fly, and their ability to fly helped us escape from our enemies more easily and find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to point their wings against their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to crouch down on predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the devil's cubs and ephemeral ones.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others thought otherwise; the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
Sounds logical, because it doesn't look like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and flowing river on Earth, carrying eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a length of six miles.
About 20 percent of the total water from the world's rivers flowing into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3980 mi) long, draining water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed those of Giza in size or technical superiority.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were astonished by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while in religious ceremonies Latin is often used.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humanity has known basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, because they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but the theory was also formulated that they transform into new substances that shape what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more materials.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as coal.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit right into the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many people at the time of its invention.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and uses.
Now people write messages on their computer screens without ever having to go near a wire.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new replaces it.
The fission pump works on the principle that energy is required to bind a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy car overboard, and by re-dividing the core, it releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, that is, they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick in the nearest area and 100 km in the farthest.
It's thinner under the Mariana and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more marsh on the nearest side, because the crust is thinner, and the lava is easier to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on researching what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalized as they matured and became adults.
These theories study what makes certain people want certain things and what things around them will or won't lead them to do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Theory of the Two Factors.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and demanding responsibilities from people.
On the other side of the coin, you become an unrecognizable individual who believes that you need to change everything the team has done and adopt it as their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often creates divisions between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams respond to the same levels of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by national management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive component of virtual teams.
The invisible team is the management group to which each member is responsible. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the slow process of establishing an organization that encourages learning? One of the goals of implementing an organization's learning concepts is innovation.
When all the resources available are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can sweat.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that responds to customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as sharing knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research, so it narrows down the scope of research and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The spread of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides a wealth of information and material that allows us to build simulation models to help us understand the process in our minds.
Although AI has strong nuances of science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research seeks to automate machines for activities that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to patients' diagnoses and questions, as well as writing, voice and facial recognition.
These kinds of things have become independent disciplines, which try to provide solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it has been integrated into multiple home software and video game applications.
Tours are a very important part of any classroom, and teachers often love to take their students to places where traveling by bus is not feasible.
Technology offers the solution through virtual school visits, where students can view museum appliances, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art sitting on their desks.
Sharing a virtual school trip can also be a great way to reflect on the trip and the experiences shared with other classes in the future.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year the website is remodeled, but earlier versions are kept online to act as a cutting edge album.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their experiences with blogging by showing poor grammar and spelling, in general, audience presence makes them change.
As students are often the most critical audience, the editor of the blog starts to work hard to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, maintaining a blog "obligates students to learn more about the world around them". The need to feed the public's interests inspires students to show their intelligence and be interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "allows students to be empowered to be more analytical and critical; by providing an active response to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writing, as well as define their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's adorable bilingual capital city that has a selection of art galleries and museums where you can contemplate the country's past and present.
Further south are the steep slopes of Niagara and further north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario an example of what foreigners consider to be intrinsically Canadian.
Large areas opposite the north are barely populated and many are practically uninhabited wilderness areas.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most diverse continent in terms of flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associates with France and famous for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region which was deeply settled in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the route of the Cape from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women who travel here are advised to claim to be married, regardless of marital status.
It may also be helpful to wear a wedding ring (which does not seem too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences could lead to what they would consider harassment and it is common for them to chase them, hold them by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to assert your position (cultural differences or not, it is not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sailors in the 10th century BC and used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, before finally abandoning it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders, who established trading bases there, brought Casablanca to it.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as taxis, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of bagatellas, but all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and most of the city's streets, particularly downtown, were buried.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be investigated to learn about the state of the ongoing confrontation in North Kivu province.
Also, the city is the base from which you can climb the Nyiragongo Volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
The normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for that short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, the term Timbuktu in English has become a metaphor for exotic and remote islands.
Today, Tombouctou is a very poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it also has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, threatened by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on the Henry Louis Gates PBS special on the Wonders of the African World.
The city offers a stark contrast to the rest of the country, with its more Arab and African air.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northwestern South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which maintains different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in other South African National Parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
It is also likely to be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which offers access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the entire territory and is the place many tourists consider most relevant.
The Hong Kong skyline-defining building parade was compared to a glossy bar chart made evident by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, you'll have to leave the island and head to the Kowloon Pier on the opposite bank.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on land gained from the sea on the northern coast.
The British colonists took this place for granted, so if you're looking for samples of the colonial history of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove coastal strip on the planet, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland to Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest that lies in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not mere mangrove swamps: they include some of the last strongholds of the impenetrable guns that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 chitis in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (crossing the river) uninterrupted throughout the day, but most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30 h.
Since buses between districts are usually crowded, it is recommended to buy tickets in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese coaster buses, comfortable and solid vehicles.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient method of traveling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Both towers reach a height of 83 metres, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The gable under the bridge is 15 metres high. Its construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group to inhabit what is now eastern Paraguay; they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guajiru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the 'giant province of the Indies', was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous peoples.
The period of colonization initiated by the Spanish lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to largely maintain its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year is held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, you can consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Malvinas pound (FKP), whose value is fixed in equivalent to the pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
Pound sterling is generally accepted on all islands and in Stanley itself credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
In the peripheral islands, credit cards are probably not accepted, although British and American currencies will be accepted; you should consult with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is most acceptable.
It is virtually impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so it is advisable to do the exchange before leaving.
When you find Montevideo south of the equator, it's summer when it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cool: temperatures rarely lie below zero, but wind and humidity combine to create a feeling of cooler than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainful" or "dry" seasons: rainfall remains almost unchanged throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are in any case wildlife that should not be fed or domesticated.
The park administration recommends keeping a minimum distance of 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wildlife.
It's the same as the docile they may seem: bison, moose, bear, and virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so they should be given room.
Also, it should be noted that the smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid taking or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
They sank all the ships except for a British cruiser, and lost about 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence promoted by the Mau movement, a peaceful demonstration in the city was balanced by the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is located between two harbours, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are divided into three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are in the Pacific Ocean and range from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All are sandy beaches safe to swim in and most have the shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Bay, in the stylish residential areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They tend to be very crowded family beaches with a good variety of shops along the coast.
The most famous local beer is "Number One"; it's not a complex beer, but it's nice and refreshing.
There are many types of French wine to choose from, but New Zealanders and Australians are probably better at traveling.
Local tap water can be safely drunk, but bottled water is easy to find in case of doubt.
For Australians, the idea of a coffee with milk is alien. One coffee is just a espresso, the capuchino carries a layer of mounted cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate on the bowl meets Belgian expectations.
Many reef trips are organised throughout the year and injury caused by these reasons is rare in reefs.
However, you should follow the advice of the authorities, follow the signals and pay special attention to safety warnings.
The cubomedusa are found near the beaches and estuaries of rivers between October and April 1770 north of the equator. They can occasionally be found outside this time.
The canines exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most canines are afraid of humans and would escape by swimming.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agents usually have offers with specific hotels, although it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, means of transportation to or from the airport or even combined airline and hotel packages.
You can also save the booking if you need time to evaluate the offer or to search for other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
However, any amendment or request must be processed first through the travel agent and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees decide to camp within the festival itself and most of them consider it a fundamental part of the experience.
To get closer to the action, you'll need to get there early to get a camping near the music.
It should not be forgotten that even if the music ends on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music until early in the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young girls.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as crossing through the ice creates an extremely unpleasant noise that affects some people more.
St. Petersburg cruises include a time in the city.
Usually, casinos make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and stay in the premises.
Some sites offer free alcoholic drinks, but drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good players are aware of the importance of remaining sober.
People who are going to drive at high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures below zero.
On icy or snowy roads, friction is low, so you can't drive the same way you would on normal asphalt.
During a race in a very short time, enough snow can fall to get caught.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow or shingles or by condensation or ice in the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries and traffic is kept virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to surface travel to see the impressive African fauna, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, can jump very close to cars, so a normal equipment will allow you to get good vision.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes show shyness, so the best way to see them is with prism glasses.
A walking safari (also called mountain walking, hiking or hiking) is the practice of hiking for a few hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, the situation may become more complicated.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellations will not go beyond July 2020, the scheduled date for the Olympics.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average entry cost of around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a passing iron and a table available for use, even if they are not in the same room.
If no iron is available or if you do not want to pass iron to your socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you want to.
Do not allow the material to boil excessively (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough, in others, it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies so if in doubt, you should consider buying the water in sealed bottles from an accredited company.
Travelers may encounter animal plagues they are not familiar with in their regions of origin.
Plagues can cause food loss, discomfort, or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing people by force are generally not considered pests.
Shopping on Duty Free is an opportunity to purchase items free of taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers who travel to countries where taxes are high can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the middle of nowhere.
If you are not used to driving on secondary roads, keep calm: steep backs, narrow races, and closed corners dominate.
The speed limits indicated are considerably lower than those of previous and later sections (usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) and their strict compliance is even more important than the other way around.
However, it's interesting that mobile phone service has more coverage here than other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and, in Bavaria, they are quite sweet and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors: Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples cooked in confections all year round, with cherries and plums appearing during the summer.
Many German grocery products also include almonds, bees and other types of dried fruit. Popular biscuits are often perfectly combined with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to try some hard, consistent pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used to cook curry; in southern India and other regions of the subcontinent coast, coconut milk is generally used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of dishes found throughout the country.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term usually means the typical food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Currently readily available throughout the archipelago, the gastronomy of Java includes a range of simple condiments, with the predominant flavours of Javanese favourites being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stripes are supports for the feet of the wheel that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the wheel, but may present safety concerns due to the possibility that the wheel's feet may become trapped in them.
If a horse falls off a horse and its foot is stuck in the stirrup, it could be dragged by the horse if it escapes.
First, most motorists wear heeled boots and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some seals, particularly English seals, have safety bars that allow a leather strap to fall off the saddle when pulled backwards in case the wheel falls.
Cochamó Valley, Chile's main destination for climbing, known as Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks have stunning views of the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes between their walls of infinite potential.
Alpine snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular and involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity, with many followers, sometimes called skiers, planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, tourism skiing or hiking skiing.
It is related, although it does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, as the latter is done on sloping terrain and requires much tougher skis and boots.
You should think of the ski route as similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions, they can cover slightly longer distances than on foot, but only occasionally will they reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would require different visas and passing through multiple passport checks.
However, the Schengen area in this sense operates to some extent as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each Schengen country separately, so that you save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is an antique. Some tax agencies define commodities over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than it would be in Europe.
Craft products could be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar large-scale products.
Reindeer breeding is an important means of subsistence among Sami people and the culture surrounding their trade is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami people participated in large-scale reindeer breeding, but lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, primarily caring for the reindeer as pets.
Today, many Sami people are working in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.

Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers who plan to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents for travel back.
Governments' willingness to issue passports without stating sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and sex varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with these documents also varies considerably.
Caches in security controls also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before surgery will not be required to go through scans to preserve their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the flow back from the waves after breaking against the beach, usually against a reef or similar.
Due to the topology of groundwater, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and it is possible to form a rapid current to the deep water from that point.
Most deaths are caused by the fatigue of trying to swim backwards, which may prove impossible.
Once you're out of the water, swimming again isn't any harder than usual.
It should be tried again in an area where there is no possibility of getting caught or, depending on swimming ability and whether it has been spotted, wait to be rescued.
The return shock occurs before the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it difficult to return to their culture of origin.
By returning home from living abroad, one has already adapted to the new culture and has lost some of the habits of one's own.

The scenes are projected onto the pyramids that are all lit up.
Many countries claim the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819. These are home to the largest number of bases, with 16 of them active by 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled boiler of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the peninsula bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge here with the plain to then re-grow and form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, where Mount Vinson in the Vinson Range reaches 4,892 m.
In remote locations with no mobile phone coverage, satellite phones are likely the only possible option.
Satellite phones are not generally a replacement for mobile phones, as you need to be outside with a direct line to the satellite to make a call.
This service is often used to make shipments, including leisure boats, in addition to expeditions that require remote data and voice.
The local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who have planned to enjoy a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among those who finish school, as they can take a year off before entering college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical year course abroad can in fact improve the chances of accessing higher education in the home country.
In general, an application fee is applied to enroll in these educational programmes.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and islands off the coast.
In the archipelago and lakes you don't need a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are undoubtedly large enough for any type of yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak allow for a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is still quite exceptional (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one per 40).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include an extension of stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and then go back to sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only plan to land on board tours, you will not need an additional visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships include Berlin (Germany) in their brochures. As can be seen on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and visits to the city are not included in the cost of the cruise.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.

Courier companies get a good payday for delivering items quickly. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies this was a problem.
If goods were sent by air mail, it was possible that on certain routes it took several days to unload and pass through customs.

An obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a lot of money on the privilege (or, even better, make the company pay for it).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you could get to pay four times the price of a regular business ticket and up to eleven times the price of a first-class ticket!
In general, it is not worth seeking discounts on business-class or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know perfectly well that there is a unique group of passengers who are willing to pay exorbitant prices for the privilege of arriving at their destination quickly and conveniently, with the corresponding charge.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in western Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but no UN member state recognizes it.
Economic ties were reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite failed political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

However, people who know a bit of Castilian could quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that they do not have to study it apart.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today and are preserved as museums or educational centers.
Since at its peak, light pollution was not the problem it is today, it is usually found in cities or campuses, which were much easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes consist of giant installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching the flowering of pork, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the thunder of the hedges was the preferred flower.
In Japan, the first pork flowering festivals were held by the emperor solely for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.

Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christendom, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding this celebration have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night in a vicilium in an open place to watch the sun rise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is likely a pre-Christian ritual to exalt spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often celebrate a Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, after which congregations usually break in with a celebration at the beginning of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands made it swim, fly or bark.
