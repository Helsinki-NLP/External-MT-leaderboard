But first, I think we need to add a component like gladiatorial combat.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes the US "Taipei Bill"
China strongly opposes the US adoption of the so-called "Taipei Bill", which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the three Sino-American joint communiques.
This was stated by the official representative of the State Council of the PRC Office for Taiwan Affairs, Ma Xiaoguang, on Friday.
The approval of the bill by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations, and a gross interference in China's internal affairs, Ma said.
He said that Taiwan is part of China and issues related to it are China's internal affairs.
"We call on the American side to clarify the situation, to immediately stop promoting relevant negative bills, and to immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to the China-US relations, as well as to the peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait", he noted.
China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, Ma Xiaoguan stressed.
TikTok is hiding unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years old.
This is Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
Documents obtained by the publication say that the owner of TikTok (the company ByteDance) uses the application to promote China's foreign policy goals abroad.
The bulk of the violations related to China's policies fall under "incitement to hate".
In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in context that fits the general guidelines, so that the social network's actions do not appear censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general ban on "criticism or attacks on the politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc".
Banning references to the Tiananmen Square incident or the Cambodian genocide falls under "distorting the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists the names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen", including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document said.
The forbidden material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Posts from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and may lead to the blocking of the user.
Less serious violations fall into the second category: such posts remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok's algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules are outdated and no longer applicable: "We now use a localised approach to moderation and also involve independent local experts".
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on posting, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the "Producer Center".
Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" is agreed with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without agreement, reports Bogdanov.
Asked if it is possible to comment on politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov replied in the affirmative and said he had seen similar posts.
Roman Zaripov, the founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can't post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on".
But under these rules, any content that does not please the moderators can be included, Zaripov notes.
Zaripov's agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years old.
According to the user agreement, only people over 13 years old can use TikTok.
The social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that a user is underage, his account may be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.
Istanbul residents told about the earthquake in the city
A strong earthquake has caused panic in Turkey's largest city
Last Thursday, September 26, an earthquake of magnitude 5.9 occurred in Istanbul.
Thirty-four people were injured, ten of whom are still in hospital.

Roszdravnadzor reported on the results of the check on the amputation of the child 's hand
A child in the Rostov region had his arm amputated due to a mistake by doctors, "Vzraz" reports with reference to the website of the territorial body of Roszdravnadzor.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who are replacing bank phone numbers has increased.
This is reported by "Kommersant" with reference to data from the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided the operators with information on more than 2,500 numbers that called customers of various financial institutions.
Operators have detected 189 cases of a number change.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases, restrictions were placed on the use of financial services.
Deputy head of the Central Bank's information security department, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had encountered the change of number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the Central Bank's warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the Law "On Communication".
Otkritie Bank, Rosbank and Alfa Bank confirmed the increase in fraudulent calls with a change of number.
As reported in the press service of "BiLayn", part of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would have disrupted the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters' numbers, which the operator will refer to each call to verify the number.
He explained that to create such a base, it would require amendments to the legislation.

Stoltenberg and Zelensky discussed the entry of Ukraine into NATO
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky were discussing Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Secretary-General made the announcement during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Asked whether the issue had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said they had indeed discussed the issue, and also stressed that he had not specified the timing of Ukraine's entry into NATO in his response.
He said that any country that wants to join the North Atlantic Alliance must meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, RT writes.
In Crimea, Zelensky was offered an alternative course in NATO
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should focus on building good neighborly relations with Russia instead of heading for NATO.
This was reported on Friday, September 27, by the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrynets.
"Mr. President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but listen to the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia", - said Chegrinets to journalists "RIA Novosti".
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will remain in power only if he establishes relations with the Russian Federation.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had spoken with Zelensky about the country's entry into the alliance.
According to him, Ukraine is obliged to fulfill certain conditions.
On June 5, the deputy of the Rada, Yevgeny Balitsky, said that the possible accession of Ukraine to the alliance does not guarantee the improvement of life in the country.

Barcelona is blackmailing Neymar
Barcelona and former Brazilian striker Neymar are trying to resolve a financial dispute that erupted after the striker moved to Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost went to court, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without Themis's interference.
Otherwise, they'll refuse him entry.
Neymar and his shrewd father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, have come up with an interesting trick: under the agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he has received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
What's more, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When the Catalan capital became aware of Neymar's claims, Barcelona sent a counter-suit.
The Blue and Grenadines insist that the bonus was for the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of the 40 million euros and demands the return of a proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barรงa almost agreed to return the "prostitute" player to the bosom of Catalonia.
The deal fell through, but the hope of a return to the forward remains.
According to Sports.Ru, citing insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the financial claims were not settled in a pre-trial manner, it would rule out the possibility of the Brazilian's return.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he has asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

At the same time, the Reform Party wanted Andres Soutter to be on the council instead of Janus Tamkevi.
Laar replied that the aim of the Reform Party was to gain two seats in the Bank of Estonia's board - so that in addition to Janus Tamkevi, Andres Sutt would also be on the board.
On Tuesday, September 24, the Riigikogu rejected Laar's proposal to appoint new members of the board of the Bank of Estonia.

Despite the reduction in the number of communal streets in Moscow, the demand for them does not fall.

How to increase future pension and not recycle
Not only the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also non-state pension funds are able to pay pensions.
The NGOs are private companies, according to "Volgogradskaya pravda.ru".
They work like a deposit: you make a contribution, the fund invests it, and over time, it gives you back the money with interest.
If you are interested in this method, first study the information about NPF on the website of the Bank of Russia.
All funds operate under uniform rules, which are set by federal laws.
Pension points can be bought legally.
The number of points you have left out depends on how many years you have worked before you qualify for a pension.
This method is suitable for those who have worked unofficially.
You can also contribute for a relative, for example a housewife.
Recommendation for those who are thinking about retirement at the beginning of their working life.
The increased pension benefits are for civil servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the Far North.
To avoid depriving yourself of everything when you reach retirement age, take care of this in advance.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, put money aside for the deposits.
The most important thing is to continually improve your financial literacy.

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident occurred on the night of April 26, 1986.
12 regions of Ukraine and 23% of the area of Belarus were exposed to radiation pollution.
In Russia, 19 regions were affected.

The former midfielder of this club in the near future can sign a contract with FC "Rostov", - reports the portal "Championship".
According to the publication, negotiations between representatives of "Rostov" and Mamaev are now in the final stage.
The 31-year-old will reportedly sign a two-year contract with an option to extend for another season.
The Sport-Express reports that a day earlier, Pavel Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination at Moscow's Dynamo, but the check was not held due to "an uncertain situation in the club".
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamayev last week by mutual consent.
The midfielder played for the Krasnodar club since 2014.
With the team, he twice won the bronze medal of the Russian championship.
Previously, Mamaev played for Moscow's "Torpedo" and CSKA.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a trolley found in a garbage can .
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after swinging a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a trolley found in a garbage dump.
Curtis Miller, 54, was digging through a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who was out for an evening stroll.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the debris.
Miller saw Beavers' find and he was upset.
He thought he could claim the cart because he was the first one to dig in the trash.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it toward his house.
Miller then took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and pursued his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers at his house.
Miller pulled the sword from the sheath and began waving it in the direction of the cart hijacker.
Beavers told Miller that the whole thing was being recorded.
When Miller saw the video camera, he ran away, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went inside.
Soon after, he saw a strange woman come into his yard and take away the cart, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man has been arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge-fund manager attacked a woman he did not know and stabbed her with a sword.
This was his reaction to the fact that guests at a wedding celebrated in the same hotel where he was staying had refused to let him light his cigarettes.
Mass riots on three.
The "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protest actions, the further it goes, the more noticeably it breaks into separate fragments and loses political content.
The evidence of the "mass riots" itself does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to put the case on hold, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the withdrawal of the charges.
The dismissal of the case should inspire the public, but it will surely leave the security forces in a state of extreme exasperation, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexei Minayilo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and after several hours he was completely rehabilitated: the Central Criminal Court had dismissed the charges against him.
Minyailo was held in detention for almost two months, supported by several professional groups: historians, priests, and literary figures.
After that, only two people were charged with participating in the riots (there were 13 initially charged): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Radjabov, who was sentenced to house arrest until the end of December (he is also charged with using violence against a government official, Article 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of a joke petition about Latvia's accession to the US
The court of the Vidzeme district of Riga has sentenced the author of the joke petition on the accession of Latvia to the United States of America, Denis Bartecki.
The man was sentenced to 80 hours of community service and one year of probation.
"Common sense is not the strongest point of our system", Bartecki commented on the court's decision.
He also said that the punishment is usually less than what is asked for.
The signature collection for Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, along with this petition, the site was collecting signatures for Latvia's joining the "Galactic Empire" and for the country's withdrawal from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was opened against Bartecki under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public call for the undermining of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Earlier, in 2016, the author of an online petition on Latvia's accession to Russia received a six-month prison sentence.

Russian MIA proposes to punish for insulting police on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the law "On Police" in order to protect the guards of order from spreading slanderous and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, a request for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of regulatory legal acts, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of police officers from "the dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of information of a slanderous nature, including those of a discrediting nature".
How exactly police officers are supposed to be protected from online slander is unclear.
The explanation to the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "through the individualization of the mechanism" already provided for in the law on blocking posts insulting government officials and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the "On Police" law are to enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law on punishing those who "openly disrespect the state" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource of the violation and gives him 24 hours to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles is provided, and for the repeated violation - administrative arrest for a period of up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition 76.ru.
Shortly after, the Chudovsky district court of Novgorod region fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for having posted "two posts with information in an indecent form that insult human dignity and public morality and express clear disrespect for society, the state, the bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation".

Can phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens extend youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly understood.
The most famous is pine pollen.
Phytoestrogens, on the other hand, have been well studied and have positive effects on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain age-related diseases (including cardiovascular diseases and some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular is soy), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such supplements are not a viable substitute for natural hormones.
We can't rule out the possibility of harm from such additives.
For example, taking them may reduce the production of your own hormones because you're getting too many of them from outside.
Veretennikov called for the revival of the Kazakh "Genis".
Former Russian national team and Rotor striker Oleg Veretennikov joined the campaign to revive the Kazakh "Genius".
The club from Astana, which in different years was called "Dynamo", "Celinik", "Astana" and "Zhenis", was disbanded in 2014.
Veretennikov defended his colors in 2004 and 2008.
"I found out about the action for the revival of the football club "Genis", organized by his fans.
I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
It was not the best of times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans who were always with the team!
I'll always remember the Munitsapov Stadium, where I scored my 200th goal in my career!
The genie must be reborn!
He's got a great history and a great fan base.
I wish them all the best and believe that the city authorities will return their native club!" - wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.
The Bastion complex has launched an Onyx missile at Chukotka.
The Ministry of Defense has conducted the first launch of a cruise missile from the complex "Bastion" in Chukotka.
The Onyx launched at a distance of 350 kilometers from the target, and 200 of them flew over land, which is a record for this type of missile.

The Bastion complexes have never been used before on Chukotka.
Hydro-met called the true folk reminiscences
In Russia, there are many folk signs that people use to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydromet has checked all the signs that are supposed to work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can be really trusted, albeit in the short-term time frame.
As Roman Vilfand, scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, said, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will indeed be wet, as our ancestors noted.
And if the sky is white, it'll rain the next day.
The second working clue is based on bird watching.
They say swallows fly low, it's usually to the rain.
The explanation is simple: When the humidity is high, the wings of the muskets get wet and the birds have to come down to hunt insects, writes TASS.
Different continents have their own traditions.
Sour Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day, one watches the nightingale emerge from its burrow to determine the time of spring.
Unidentified oil spills discovered on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spills of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The contamination was found scattered over a thousand miles of coastline.
The first reports of oil spills began to arrive on September 2.
But every day until Thursday, their numbers and their coverage continued to grow.
The Brazilian Institute of Environmental Studies conducted a chemical analysis of the samples.
It turns out that they're all identical, and it's all about crude oil.
The state-owned oil corporation Petrobras, which was given the samples for analysis, said that they did not match oil from fields in Brazil.
"This is thick oil.
It can be dumped from one of the ships after the tanks are cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And it probably got into the ocean current", said the coordinator of the oil workers union of the states of Pernambuco and Paraรญba, Rogรฉrio Almeida, to the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that despite the ban, many ships continue to dump their waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected northeastern states, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered in oil.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, in collaboration with Petrobras, will begin to clean up the polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the institute recommends that tourists and local residents avoid oil spills and report any contamination they find.

Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matviyenko
Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko believes that Russians do not have enough savings to fully implement the draft law on guaranteed pension products.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is quite common in the world.
It's another thing to be timely with the introduction.
"In my opinion, a significant part of the population now has incomes that they simply cannot allocate to increase pension provision in the future", said V. Matviyenko.
Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms of pension formation and accrual, as "the constant changes in this area have finally confused them".
This does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system, regulating its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve the size of pensions, the social protection of citizens.
But the steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account the domestic realities", - said V. Matviyenko "RIA Novosti".
The head of the FS stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on a guaranteed pension product) is to develop, then several basic principles must be provided for, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state for ensuring the preservation of pension savings.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on September 6 that it has sent a draft law on guaranteed pension products (GPP) for approval .
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee of the preservation of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, the registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for businesses and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man is still in the Marvel universe.
Sony and Disney have agreed
Image caption The news of the departure of the beloved Marvel superhero has angered many of the Marvel's most devoted fans
One of the most famous comic book characters, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures managed to negotiate the rights to use it in the franchise's films.
This was revealed in a Sony press release, which said that the third part of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on revenue sharing, which would see Spider-Man leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The rights to the movie hero are owned by Sony.
She leased them to Marvel Films, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from box office receipts, while Disney received revenue from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point, this arrangement became unpopular with Disney, and the company wanted to renegotiate the agreement.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said he was thrilled.
It's exciting that Spider-Man's journey into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is continuing.
"We're all very excited at Marvel Studios to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is the iconic figure.
This is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world", - said in his press release.
Feige also mentioned that Sony is also creating its own cinematic universe, built around Spider-Man.
"He just happens to be the only superhero to appear in multiple movie settings.
So while Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may hold surprises", he said.
Tom Holland, who has played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted a clip from The Wolf of Wall Street on his Instagram account, in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character shouts "I'm not leaving!"
The controversy between the companies broke in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man films, provided that both companies would pay half of the cost of producing the films.
But that didn't sit well with Sony.
News of the possible departure of the beloved Marvel superhero has angered many of the company's loyal fans.
Details of the new terms have not been released.
As CNBC reports, Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: "We have been working together for the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We are happy to move forward together".
Avengers: Endgame, featuring Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing film in the history of the world's cinema, taking the top spot from Avatar.

In Khabarovsk, the court sentenced four residents of the village of Druzhba, who for two years looted the dachas in the "Cosmos" and "Raduga" partnerships in the area of the Black River.
This was reported by the Khabarovsk region today on September 27.
The gang included previously unconvicted men aged 31 and 37 and two brothers aged 21 and 24.

The damage from each of the thefts amounted to from three to 21 thousand rubles.
The thieves took away stoves, refrigerators, curtains, buckets, gas cylinders, chairs, and many other items.

In the Congress, Trump's conversation with Zelensky saw a "Russian trail"

Expert says why you should avoid tea bags
A team of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when a tea bag is brewed in a cup, over ten billion microplastics are ingested in five minutes.
Particles of sawdust can also be added to packaged beverages, food safety expert Yelizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the producer may add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
They don't throw away sawdust at the end of the season, so they can end up in the tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the packets", said Tikhonova.
She says that it is better to avoid the drink and instead drink the tea that is sold in specialized shops.
She also stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in its composition but also in its production method - the micro-particles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to release harmful substances.
"The best thing to do is to buy pure green or black tea, which has the least amount of additives", said the expert.

Regions invited to share secrets of business support
As it became known to the Parliamentary Gazette, on September 27, the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutupov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express their position on the initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
It 's time to establish interregional ties
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on the programs for business development and the legalization of self-employment, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals for improving the current legislation.
"Today, communication between regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit by the senators was indicated the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole", - said Andrei Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available in the editorial).
In addition to the relevant ministries, regional executive heads also receive the regional summary data.
The exchange of information on the success of the regions could give an impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to this exchange would be to send the information that the Committee on Economic Policy has", the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
A useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operate support programmes for small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, in the Vologda region, the Entrepreneurship Support Center operates, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a system of support for business has been developed, which provides for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.

In some other regions, special measures are being taken to support youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed people continue to be taken out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes should be made to the existing legislation to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity", as it "best corresponds to the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to make amendments that provide for the expansion of the list of activities performed by self-employed citizens, including the types of activities for decorating and repairing residential premises, cottage buildings, conducting physical training.
The Bryansk region considers it important to increase the control of unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
In the Kostroma and Magadan regions, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the areas of support for social entrepreneurship are advocated in the normative-legal field.
All the proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific draft laws.
"All the proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific law projects", - assured Andrey Kutepov.
The airline has helped passengers avoid the neighborhood of crying babies .

Now, if you want to avoid being next to them.
Passengers on Japan Airlines (JAL) have been given the opportunity to take advantage of a new option to avoid unwanted proximity to small children.
The airline has launched a feature that allows you to track which seats your children will be sitting in.
When selecting seats in the cabin during ticket booking, passengers will be able to see the image of the child's head in the seats occupied by children aged eight days to two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the babies because of the possible inconvenience associated with their crying may be able to get as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline's services were delighted with the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, saying that other airlines should do the same.
One user complained that he was flying from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and there were three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commenter suggested "adults only flights", saying they would be willing to pay extra for such a flight.
Many travelers have said they will now always choose Japan Airlines for their travels, as they see no comfort in flying next to a crying baby in an enclosed space.
Earlier, a woman traveling with a nursing baby tried to appease her fellow passengers during a flight from Seoul to San Francisco.
She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each one containing an apology note.

Pavel Ustinov joined the picket in support of the defendants of the "Moscow case"
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined a series of "Freedom for All" single picketing events that are taking place on Friday near the Russian presidential administration building on Stary Square in Moscow, Interfax correspondent reports.
The series of picketing began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since then.
Currently, the participants of the action, alternating with each other, stand holding a poster with the inscription "Freedom for all" and the names of the convicts and those arrested after the uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.

Supplies of "sanction" to Russia fell by 100 times
The Russian government has estimated that deliveries of agricultural products and foodstuffs to Russia from countries that have been subject to the Russian food embargo have decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioned countries, compared to 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $ 226.5 million from $ 4 billion 975.5 million respectively.
We're talking about the supply of goods that didn't fall under the embargo.
As the report indicates, the decreased volumes of prohibited imports were compensated by increased imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, Serbia.
Recall that in late August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited to import into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official legal information portal, noted that the validity of the rules has been extended for another year - from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Initially, the decree on the abolition of sanctions applied to products from the USA, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein were "joined" to this list, and on January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
Putin's decree to destroy the "sanctions" (food embargoes imposed by Moscow in response to Western anti-Russian sanctions) that were illegally imported into the country came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" food by any legal means.
As Western sanctions persisted, the Russian Federation also extended its response.
However, this does not apply to products that are imported for personal use.
The ban does not apply to goods for personal consumption weighing less than 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had earlier called the destruction of food "simply immoral", and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, the initiative to ban the destruction of food products suitable for consumption was taken by Rospotrebnadzor in early June.
After that, the Council for Human Rights under the President of the Russian Federation gave a similar recommendation to the government.
And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that destroying food is wrong, and we need to think about how to use it for its intended purpose, assessing its quality.

Chile is building a 1 billion euro telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
As ESO reports, this week the construction of the dome of the building that will house the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope), the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomy project to date, has officially begun.
The total cost of the ESO is estimated to be over one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking mirror, which will be about 120 feet [39 m] in diameter.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, along with two auxiliary reflective surfaces, each 14 and 12 feet (4.2 and 3.75 m) in diameter, will help the E-ELT to obtain the first detailed images of planets outside our solar system, stars in other galaxies, and to search for Earth-like planets.
In addition, scientists will try to use the observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Although the dome has only just begun, scientists, engineers, and other experts have been working on the mirrors, scientific instruments, and other components of the observatory for three years - since the first plans for the E-ELT were announced.
The contract for the main mirror, which cost about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
