The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the Conditorei.
The new members of the Council of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old and new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and the city council.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has a bit of a "knockdown" on members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they master the notorious snake that has become popular in recent years, when the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the late era of Mayor Pavel Bém borrows from some of the most well-known actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, the new councils were somewhat shady in their use of these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know".
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics", Lukáš Kaucký, the new Minister of Culture, said to the "Pate's vocabulary" test.
But Councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"That's the only expression you've given me here that I use every now and then".
"Otherwise, I don't like snake much".
From the dictionary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six terms, especially those notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrates' Court.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the great Prague gulf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "stone-washing", "treason to the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised to participate in the conversation but then did not even take the listeners.
The fifth Councilman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the Civic Democrats talk to each other".
"It is important to me how we understand each other in our programmes", he replied.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the above-mentioned headline allegedly did not realize that the talk was about the influential businessman and friend of the former mayor of Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the biggest Prague Gulf hole".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel", says Kaucký, but added to the security: "But I know that more from the newspaper".
And jokingly, "I'm going to have to take a language course".
The "golf hole" is then correctly described as the Blanka tunnel not only by Matador Karel Březina but also by the Councilman for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort is and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where to find this figure and what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague restaurant business", Plachý is pretty close to solving the mystery, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
However, he agrees with Březina that he has drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than from his own vocabulary.
The Social Democrats, judging from the test subjects, do not seem to have a similarly civilized slang.
"I asked my colleagues, too, but obviously we don't really have that kind of thing".
"We call each other by name, sometimes we also use acronyms or nicknames", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - nicknamed "Hulda" by his party colleagues.
"I was called Bříza (Birch) at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", Karel Březina tells us.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and see, it works.
Mr Weinert is friendly to his party members, the "Grandpa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who before the elections, through machine-made party sponsorship, drew attention to himself, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (a well-known Czech Lego figure).
The Social Democrats are the only ones who allow such nicknames in the internal party language.
Hulínský is said to dislike being called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname for the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Nut Rights" is allegedly related to the fact that Petr Hulínský obtained his title of Doctor of Jurisprudence from the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and has issued a brochure
Women who are branded witches in Burkina Faso usually share some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to be older, they cannot find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women "becomes" a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become a danger to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate".
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with work and give birth", describes one religious sister, who cares for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government decided to take action against this abnormal "social action".
And for that reason, he issued a brochure to stop the "witch hunt".
But there's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read", the newspaper der Standard pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured oil on her and simply lit her up.
The BBC server also reported on the incident.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter was merely a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, the oil is ignited, used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "eject an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports the people here regardless of their education.
The Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Women who break human souls were a danger in the past as they are today".
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to de-escalate the witch hunt, the Gambian president himself has been involved in the process last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh started a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as they allegedly had a hand in their deaths and were now trying to kill the president himself through black magic".
"He called for help from shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguards, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the imprisoned were forced to drink a waste of plants that had hallucinogenic effects, but which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven, yet pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the RPG Byty customer centre of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm was a briefcase with three new leases for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is serving a prison sentence.
All three were just raised in rent under the so-called "de-regulation".
Instead of 3,500 crowns a month, the son is to spend 4,100 crowns next year on a two-room apartment with a second-class kitchen.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven", he angrily ticks his finger on his son's new lease, for which he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed", he explains half displeased and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease terms as 'incorrect and immoral', advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waves.
"One says this, the other says that", he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava is thus becoming a major 'de-regulation laboratory'.
After the new year, this deregulation is expected to affect most rental properties in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market-based rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" personally.
The waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already at nine o'clock this Tuesday morning is breaking full.
Right next to the door, there's a security guard with a call machine.
"Rent 2011", that's how a special keypad on the touchscreen lights up.
You type in a short time, the device will spit out a number plate.
We've barely decoded the number "157" and it's already beeping on the big screen on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and the like.
From mid-November, the new lease agreements in the Ostrava region will flatten the mailboxes of most tenants of the RPG portfolio's 44,000 apartments.
RPG Byty has written to them proposing a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for new rents in the customer centre has been open since 18 November.
"The campaign is going on for a week, so this is just the beginning", the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment's hesitation, as the "client" reveals himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining habitations are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the deputy parliamentary president from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from the ČSSD, had raised the issue quite loudly, no wonder the newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want them to have a new floor".
"Never in my life have I been able to replace them with toilet glasses", says the man mentioned earlier.
The staff say that the main task now is for pensioners to check whether they will actually receive the promised RPG rental reduction if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease before 15 December will also be able to take advantage of a half-reduced February rent.
But until now, the "de-regulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overwhelmed with demand.
"Of the 360 customers we had yesterday, only about 40 to 50 were renting here in 2011", the switchbeds estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites and wallpapers wherever necessary.
However, if the parties do not agree on the new lease, it shall be determined by an independent court.
"This is not meant to be a threat, but is meant to be information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal process", RPG explains on its websites.
"No one is going to court here", says one of the employees of RPG Byty, and a man on the street outside the customer centre is at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (KR) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left over for food, where should I get the money for a court case", he says.
Then the employee will be insecure.
"I'll see you around".
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them through the media not to sign and so people wait", she reflects.
The regulated lease ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year's Day 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
'The existing rent level is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund,' argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty, and - in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the increase is the neglect of the housing fund, which has been criticized by the tenants who have paid off.
While RPG was able to invest 4 billion in the apartments from rented rentals between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to invest 5,2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstery seats in Havířov's waiting room, some red-lighting information is constantly showing up.
'The 2011 rental increases of 15% and less concern 31 200 dwellings, or more than 90% of RPG dwellings.'
"This always means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square metre per month", is read on the LCD monitor.
Just 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will increase rent by 38 percent.
'In these cases, it is an increase in extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square metre,' RPG argues.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not boost rents in a leap, but will be done gradually within four to eight years.
Moreover, the company imposes a further obligation: all the income from the increase in rent (see chart) is to be returned to the dwellings, especially in terms of heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
- the first is to benefit those who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects looked in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, lots of toys, and even a mini-gaming area on the outdoor terrace.
This preschool has been available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The architectural and design office Arch.Design, which has a number of well-known Brünner buildings, has been working on the premises for its mini-children's garden since the first designs for the new building.
It is a good idea, because most of its 90 employees are in the baby boom era and the company is committed to getting the designers back to work as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility of working for a shorter period, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the context of its social programme.
It is easier for civil engineers and architects to put their demanding profession and childcare under one roof.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the staff at Arch.Design and with the support of the management they have been able to win grants from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and the Czech Republic's State budget.
This financing (grants of CZK 2.8 million) enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be provided and qualified staff and operations were provided for a period of two years.
After the funding has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the miniature nursery for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the firm Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application process.
The children are cared for by a qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher - who can visit the kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only five children are allowed to attend at the same time, but the day changes over several children.
The nursery is flexible to meet the needs of parents, whose children have the same rights as all employees in the use of the nursery - regardless of the hierarchy of companies and their respective positions.
Although individual education and care is involved, the content of the mini-kindergarten programme is nevertheless comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
The children not only play here, but above all they are taught excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What is more, the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can look at the children at any time and thus relieve the stress of having children pick up late from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also emerging.
Arch.Design was one of the Czech companies that offered significant benefits in recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programmes.
A bone house is still fascinating after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are ripped fishmills.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The local people gave the house the nickname "Bonehouse" because of its organic forms.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile scraps and mosaics, the shell-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines are all characteristics of Antonio Gaudi's youthful style.
The façade of the house is a play with beautiful lines, delicate colors and textures that remind nature and living creatures.
Only when you look closely do you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire façade is more plastic, dramatic, and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same fluid lines and curved shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even viewing holes and decks.
The Batlló House in the Eixample district on Passeig de Grácia shopping street No. 43 was built by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but eventually he agreed with Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
But Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his dashboard that the decorations for the real estate owner's representative apartment were created and the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given its organic shape by the local inhabitants because of the nickname "Bonehouse".
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "going house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, unique to the time, with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre is suggesting her 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and did not let himself be misled by them.
Although he obtained the city's approval before construction began, his information on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when the city fathers finished it, they were so horrified by the result that they demanded a remedy.
The Council members also found that the building with its pillars even entered the public sidewalk.
However, no further changes were made, quite the contrary - only 15 days after the request of the district Josep Batlló submitted an application for the lease of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
The second floor gallery had a social room, and the third floor had the bedroom and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the living room doors, so that a larger society can talk comfortably without having to forgo some intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house was renovated by Gaudí and, in addition to a new facade, it was given a rather unusual roof and two more floors.
Gaudí's play with light, as well as the blue and white glazed tiles that cover the courtyard and the lighthouses, are also impressive.
The play of these two colors gives the highest degree of light to all floors of the house.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló, which was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, is now open to all.
The first floor is the most spacious and elegant apartment open to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year, on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When they found that this was a fairly lucrative business, they kept the visits, and they extended them to other common and rooftop rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price for visiting the monument is not a pencil, however, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and tourist pass holders get a 20 percent discount.
This is more than the entrance fees for other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the occupants and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bedrest?
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the surface - so mattresses and rust make the good bed.
However, these must be complemented in a harmonious way to meet the specific needs of the user.
Many factors play a role in the selection process - weight, size, health status and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior of the mattress and the roast must be equally important.
Typical example?
In a home that does not receive regular heating over the weekend, latex mattresses are not well suited because they take much longer to "warm up".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than regular polyurethane mattresses.
And they should be turned around regularly.
If they do not have enough vent in the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture builds up, so it is not excluded that they form under the mold.
Of course, what you're used to is also a factor in choosing.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"All the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they can't sleep properly here anymore".
"For their slender shoulders, buttocks, and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam".
"I recommend this, among other things, for people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder that makes them unable to receive the 'information' from the joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, a specialist in upholstery furniture.
So many years ago, I got many ice hockey players and other customers these memory foam mattresses.
'Today this is no longer a problem, as such mattresses are offered by Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex and the Czech manufacturer Tropico, among others.'
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the heat absorbed, or in other words, it is directly attached to the warm body.
Nowhere is it pushing, you don't roll around at night like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (burn).
When choosing the size of the mattress, the length of the soles of the feet should still be taken into account for the size of the body, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women who are at least 180 cm tall need a bed that is 210 to 220 cm long.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of bed width, or 180 cm.
In single beds, for example in single beds, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
For the convenience of visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "When lying on your back, there should be enough room for the slightly angled arms", advises Helena Prokopová, the master of upholstery and space-fitting, who has been working for years on the subject of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and has been presenting this subject in professional schools.
In a double bed, everyone needs their own roast and mattress, but be careful when shopping to keep the mattresses the same height.
Otherwise, the only thing left is to mount the bed in different heights, and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, and feathered mattresses 15 cm high, with at least 3 cm of this on the molding layer and the fine cushion.
"You must not feel the feathers with your hand or when you put them on", warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a specific type of roast.
Full-covered beds with mattresses and underpants like twins of a litter have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the connection cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat in one night, it's clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) seabed.
This is why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise mattresses a lifetime of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee.
Every thing has its If and But.
And that is why a practical advice from the merchants: For mattresses that are 120 or 140 centimeters wide, you should not be afraid of the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, yet it is advisable to use a mattress cleaner that can be easily removed and washed.
Although today mattress covers are usually made with a round-breasted seal, so that when opened you get two halves (especially important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation of larger mattresses, especially by yourself, often seems to be the uneven battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a plate in bed instead of a roast?
Get that out of here!
Or at most, a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
They should also be fitted with ventilation holes (if none are already in) and use mattresses with feathered skeletons and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket feathers and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses are not included in such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mats (including combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable latex mats with 14 to 18 feathered bars (lamels), whereas a larger number of latex mats, i.e. 28 or more feathered bars, with a loose support in the lumbar vertebrae area and the possibility of regulating the lattice hardness, always pay off.
Adjustable laminate grades do not include feathered mattresses as they do not react to ergonomic shifting.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the feather straps, special flexible schooling modules are also offered.
The purpose of this is to provide a special attachment of the plinths, which allows the plinths to be pressed or even bent so as to allow the shoulder of the sleeper to descend in a point.
Especially for men with broad shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip.
For the most demanding customers, point-lastic flame-flex systems or rods with point-lastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion fencing are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, reducing the tension.
But if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the benefits are lost.
Here's another rule: the head pillow should support the head, and its tips should only reach to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a cushion of 50 x 60 cm, as the Scandinavians like to do, would be ideal.
In the side position, the head pillow (along with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the old strawbags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
The new magic word is "bio" even in mattresses.
Instead of crude oil, natural oils are increasingly being used to make polyurethane foams - for example, castor and soybean oil.
Soya is probably used by all known producers.
"Bio means mattresses whose core is made of materials of pure natural origin", explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also buy microcapsules that can spread the fresh scent of forest or lavender when you sleep.
Here too, a difference is made between man and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used in men to allow the mattress cover to absorb heat and cool the body, the covers have a "warming" effect in women.
Red peppermint extracts stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets comfortable warmth while sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with a damaged cell structure and is therefore more breathing-active than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
Combining the different hardness of cold foam and visco foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heel are.
But for a high-quality mattress, you have to pay 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually taxed at a lower rate because they are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to be granted this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and the rust is not that easy.
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco-foam memory for CZK 11,990.
The second one is free.
It was the material Tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at a nearly cosmic pace.
No wonder they were designed for NASA, because astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads when they launch.
Temperature becomes soft in heat, and in cool conditions it solidifies.
It fits perfectly into the human body and distributes body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns but also generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as special foot cushions designed to provide relief for the legs and vessels.
For example, local producers use Eucatherm C foams, Twinsavers or similar products.
More and more parents want human-monitoring devices to keep their kids in check.
The fear of their own children is growing, and more and more parents are considering monitoring them using GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to track down cars, can locate people just as well, which would be helpful in cases like the recent untraced disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette case, but soon it is not likely to be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people are terrified of the missing Anička and are looking for ways to better protect their children.
And for the price of compromising their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a case of espionage, but an effective way of reducing the likelihood of tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have never had such cases before".
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons", adds Pilin.
But he feels that the child should always know what the box is for and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing things when they don't want to be controlled".
"At first, parents were very much expecting mobile phones, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices", says Mrs Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In planned abductions, the kidnapper will almost always check whether the child has any electronic equipment to locate him".
"It's the phone today".
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also look for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by mass advertising".
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set to report the position at certain intervals".
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available".
"More expensive devices even have a tilt gauge built in, meaning that if you fall and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position", says Mr Čech.
He believes that similar services could also be used by smart phones with navigation, but only to play a specific software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices that look like trailers or smaller phones.
There's always the risk of losing her.
According to Mr Pilin of Macro Weil, we are therefore testing devices that look like normal digital watches.
"It has the advantage that the attacker does not have to realize that it is a surveillance or tracking device.
"Or he doesn't realize it until after a certain time, which gives the police a lead in time", he adds.
No matter which direction the development is going - to bracelets or trailers - the same technology is always used as in vehicle tracking.
So the combination of location using the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current location.
The army has so many fire ropes that you could wrap up the whole of the Czech Republic you keep but only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of firewood, which is being fired with explosives.
The year before, the Department of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of torchline to the army.
It's comforting to know that the military has been providing for 225 years.
The problem is the durability of the filament - two years, but not more than four.
The army bought the chain from the STV Group, a.s. for 40 million lapis.
In his explanation for purchasing this huge quantity of firewood, the General Staff of the MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of firewood annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES referred to, this indication suggests that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaners.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of firewood be justified.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 detonations, by the way.
But even so, these army holdings would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is that two meters of torch cords are enough to train every new professional soldier, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned by these new purchases - even in view of the increased need for pioneering and special forces.
The rapid-fire brigade recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no handgun cartridges, so firing exercises were severely limited by the lack of resources.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't understand why they buy so many of us".
But ultimately, it's their decision, and they'll know what they need it for".
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we as a trader want to meet as much as possible", says Jan Děcký, sales manager at STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of cordon by saying that the army would have been covered in this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year lifespan of the firing line and of only two years for police and army pyrotechnicians.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably possible", admits one of them, who wants to remain anonymous so as not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
After the expiry of the period of use, each ammunition must be thoroughly tested for reliability and for not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not free, but they cost extra money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defence is the discount for the 445 kilometres of the cordon.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 244 kilometers", says Spokesman Pejšek, who told us the viewpoint of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defense.
For comparison, the annual consumption of firecrackers used by police firing squads, the Second World War or the Soviet Union's armed forces, has been barely 1,500 meters for some years.
And the police always order only the quantities of ammunition they can consume before the expiry date.
The safety of fire engineers also allows flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords.
The Ministry of Defence has already had huge problems in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of munitions from the Warsaw Pact when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years when liquidating hundreds of kilometres of old firewood, which they have bought so cheaply today.
To this day, I have the contacts I have gained through the competition.
The winning entry in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Last year, the winner of the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that there were no good accommodation options in Liberec at reasonable prices.
With the savings he made from his vacation work abroad and a bank loan, he built a five-bedroom, sloppy house.
Considering that he was a sixth-year college student at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time was annoying to me, so I tried to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately put all the profits back into the house, which he then converted step by step to a 54-bed retirement home.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds for all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of these was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel" until recently.
This year, another top-notch hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotel franchise have already signed up", says the number one entrepreneur from last year.
'A large part of this sale of hotel licences was won by the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' competition,' adds Mr Pytloun.
The victory has brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and surrounding areas.
"People recognized me on the street, often congratulating me later on, and I must say that was really good", he recalls.
I really recommend that anyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, every show is good.
He says he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances that he would not have otherwise.
"I still have regular business relationships with some people I have met through the competition".
He believes that the fame associated with success also boils down a little to each of his employees.
And he's up to 70.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in them for being part of something that will be universally recognized".
I really don't just see this as personal success, no, it's the result of the good work we all do".
"My name is only a little highlighted", says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a calmer year than we had on the farm.
The triumphal euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his ambition, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Last year, the first-place prize in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition was awarded to Karel Žďárský, the owner of Farmet.
The jury then appreciated the efforts he made to bring down a company that has hundreds of millions of sales from the small tool factory in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that this recognition has encouraged not only me but all my employees and has strengthened our confidence in the fight against competition", says the previous year's winner.
Farmet's early history was the effort to do something useful.
And then, as compensation for the Communist seizure of property, the state offered his father, Karel Žďárský, a small workshop for rent, he soon abandoned his career in the company he had worked for and started his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few of his father's comrades.
Soon after, they began to focus on pressing vegetable oil.
Within 18 years, they had become the largest automated press manufacturer in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the competition and its media coverage that it became known to the non-professional public.
"Not only are our customers now seeing far more intensely the Farmet brand, but our foreign partners are also starting to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not just a victory year for Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company's economic performance in 2008 and partly in 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for selling tool construction products.
The crisis, which then shook not only citizens but also businesses, was at its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"We could not escape this situation, of course".
"The sales declined by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even cut jobs", explains Karel Žďárský
A viable enterprise sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
But it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to cut back on investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international exhibitions and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions", says Žďárský.
Everything is proof that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere", Karel Žďárský tells the audience.
A poll that cleans up with senseless regulations
The "Absurdity of the Year" poll is part of the entrepreneurship competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless rules have already been made out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" poll was the obligation to create documents for authorities that are available online.
More than a third of the less than four thousand voting entrepreneurs made the decision.
The Social Security Administration thus required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
The opinion poll has changed this.
'The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the Commercial Register when checking social security contributions in the future,' said Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Security Administration.
The purpose of the 'Absurdity of the Year' poll is to examine all the regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with and to remove the nonsense.
This is the fourth time this year that the competition has been organised by the Czech business magazine (HN) and is gaining increasing popularity among the public.
If last year the 3,000 people took part in the vote, this year it was already four thousand.
It is no wonder that there are still a lot of legal obligations that are solely designed to hinder business activity.
"As regards the number of income tax forms, for example, we are at the forefront of the world", observes Karel Havlíček of the Czech Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises.
The simplification of business has been the stated objective of all governments in recent years.
The situation in the Czech Republic has, however, not improved much compared to the rest of the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th in terms of terms of business, an eight-point lower ranking than the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first called in the year and takes place every year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
The registration process is conducted at www.firmaroku.cz. The organiser of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and invites the public to vote on the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It's the absurdity that gets the most votes.
This year's opinion poll has already included more than a hundred, or 105 meaningless regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
The competition's nominees include, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways must pay a toll or that entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets must perform every two years.
The list of this year's 'seven' is published on the page of the competition.
The competition is held in Prague's Wenzelplatz in early November and is part of an event that regularly involves political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were present at the height of the competition.
"Where the state throws a ball between the legs of entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic boost, so my goal is to remove at least 30 paragraphs each year that are still unnecessarily burdensome for entrepreneurs today", said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create meaningless orders from the world are showing results.
In 2007, the most disturbing thing was the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to notify the trade office three days in advance of their intention to go to an exhibition or to Kirmes with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was abolished by virtue of a new Act on trade.
The obligation to report to the Office of Employees' Working Holidays for up to 30 days, which received the second highest number of votes in 2007, was abolished by the Green Card Act.
And all good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was adopted, which required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger scales in the living room.
This regulation was somewhat relaxed by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement was dropped.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
The evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sport projects
A novelty in the fifth annual HN competition this year is the category 'Responsible company of the year 2010'.
The main idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the environmental impact of their entrepreneurial activities and support socially responsible initiatives", says Patrik Bartholdy, Regional Manager of Vodafon, the organizer and sponsor of this competition and the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year's first edition of Vodafone's main sub-category of the company of the year competition was attended by companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough material for a standalone article.
Although they differ diametrically in their subject matter, their efforts share a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is for example about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, the Prague software company Et Netera was among the 14 finalists from all over the Czech Republic, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then compete in numerous tournaments in a wide variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo Society, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation for disabled children for 17 years.
A paper mill in Poděbrady also provides exemplary care for its health-disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of 'Responsible company of the Central Bohemian Region'; it was third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition for this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, introducing, inter alia, a fluid working time reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company primarily purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports citizen initiatives in its environment and operates on environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to minimise the environmental impact of our business and administration", explains its Managing Director, Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is concerned about the health of its employees and has therefore purchased ergonomic seats and keyboards for all laptops, and it also encourages its employees to work from home and uses cartering services provided by a local workshop for corporate events.
"We also support the People in Need Foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company Praní a čištění from the Karlsbad region, which contributes extra bonuses to the pension insurance of its employees, is also worth mentioning.
"We are providing our employees with food, work, training and holidays", says Josef Strapáč of the Bruntál construction company Czasch, the winner in the Maharashtra region.
The contest was automatically entered in the category of Responsible Company of the Year by all the district finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, who answered the questions in the questionnaire accompanying the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
The questionnaire was not evaluated by the organiser for incorrect or incomplete answers.
'If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the 'Company of the Year' competition, but were not disqualified from the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year.'
"A separate entry for this competition alone is not possible, as it is merely a subcategory of the main competition company of the year", explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrested by the police in a public tender
In the building of the landfill in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate developer, Luboš G., was kidnapped by the detectives in handcuffs.
The Commission allegedly sought to manipulate a public competition to settle refund claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition was owned by a specific interested party.
This guy, Luboš G, is supposed to have paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent schemes in a public competition", said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office, to the newspaper "Právo", but could not provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
Twenty-four hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was fired by the police.
The way in which he managed to manipulate public competition is only speculative given the scant official information.
The spokesperson for the Land Fund Lubomír Černá referred to Právo's question in this regard, stating that the police had actually made arrests at the Land Fund's Pilsner branch during a public competition.
"It was a client and not a coworker", she said.
According to Ms Černá, the public tender was correctly called 'calling for the tendering of land transfer claims under the Land Act' and would be held in cases where several applicants expressed interest in the land offered.
'These persons offer a higher value of their refund entitlements to be settled by the transfer than the value of the land claimed under the call.'
"The order of the potential buyers is determined according to the claims offered, and the land fund then transfers the land to the person with the highest bid", explains the Fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. evidently had information on who had applied for the invitation and, as he was himself a person entitled to the right to a refund, he offered to withdraw from the competition to a landlord.
Obviously against a fat paycheck.
That would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had such a large sum of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Soil Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the Land Fund, Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitution where decisions had already been taken on the location of construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. also acquired land from the Land Fund for the construction of public roads, more specifically, at the site where the road to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later, he exchanged it very cheaply with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
The town hall had to give up on the project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs rise by several hundred a month
From January onwards, households will have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, higher water and wastewater charges, and higher farmers' rents for district heating and in some places.
From January onwards, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more from their wallets each month than they have ever done before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas up to 2 percent and more, and in some cities, water will cost up to a tenth more, and in some places, district heating will cost more.
The electricity supply alone costs households several hundred crowns more a year.
The prices of high voltage have been reduced by all major suppliers, so the significant promotion of renewable energy generation, in particular from photovoltaic plants, is to blame.
Gas is only becoming moderately more expensive, but it is when people need the most heat and use the most energy.
So here too, we can expect a few hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Prices are rising, especially in larger cities.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns a month more for district heating from January onwards, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 crowns a year.
In Prague, the city's residents face a 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges if the city raises infrastructure rents.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest in comparison with the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, 140,000 rental apartments are expected to see huge increases in rental prices, with so-called rental regulation being phased out from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100% from January.
If the company does not agree with this increase, it will sue them.
The regulated rent, which is still paid in approximately 300,000 homes today, is expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids are getting drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, except for a good whiskey that was stolen from my father's bar.
These are the drinks that Czech teenagers under 15 who are drunk after drinking are most often treated for.
Children who have to spend their hangovers in the hospital repeatedly are no exception.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who have experienced similar cases in the admission of children's departments to clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk".
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol", said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief pediatrician at the Hořovice clinic in central Bohemia.
"Whiskey, if it manages to snatch the father a bottle from the bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"The advantage of vodka is that you can mix it with juice, so it doesn't smell so bad", explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman for the Motol Faculty Hospital Eva Jurinová is right.
"Most often it's Fernet or Rum".
"This is the current alcohol trend, especially in elementary schools".
'Sometimes it was Slibowitz, which you take from home,' said Ms Jurinová.
According to Dr. Pelikán, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers have long been no exception in hospital.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times".
"Her career began at the age of 12 when she was first introduced with 3.5 promils of alcohol in her blood and in combination with ecstasy", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition hall in Holešovice at some dance party".
"The interesting thing was that it was not strange for her mother that her daughter did not come home for 48 hours", wonders the chief physician.
The lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance for bothering their own puppies is one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
Experts say that true dependence in the true sense of the word is not possible in children.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children".
Those who drink alcohol repeatedly are usually characterized by a negative family and social background", explains Dr. Pelikán.
According to Motol hospital spokeswoman Ms Jurinová, by mid-November about 40 drunk children had been admitted to the local children's and youth medicine department.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are taken home by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police after ambulance treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children drink a bottle of alcohol in the school bank only once, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes on which one hundred percent is dependent: Walpurgis night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of grief over the bad testimony or out of joy over the holidays".
"I also saw seven drunk children on the set at the same time on the night of the Whalpurgo", Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who struggles with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches that arise from dehydration and lack of glucose can be relieved in the hospital by a fluid infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anywhere".
"They're just a little confused about where they are", admits Dr. Pelikán, at least sometimes ruining the patient's mood by counting the costs of treatment.
Because the ambulance transport and the night in an emergency bed are well worth a few tens of thousands.
"I used this as a teaching tool, when I directly calculated the children's costs of their drinking and that they may have to work all the holidays to earn money for one such holiday", Dr. Pelikán added.
He also said that the health insurance companies do not use recourse procedures to demand the costs of treating drunk children.
Two L-159 training aircraft for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two L-159s of five light fighters exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defence for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
It's the first time such a machine has been in the possession of a foreign army.
In the past, they have been seen only in manoeuvres or flight shows abroad.
The Czech Army operated the L-159T1 two-seater version.
The other three planes are single-seat L-159.
These are currently being preserved in the Aero Vodochody, which the broker of this business, Omnipol, took over last week.
When the planes will be physically dispatched from Vodochody, according to the Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek, it is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft were also excluded from long-term storage aircraft without further investment or investment from the Ministry's resources.
"The two-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its current condition and appearance", Pejšek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to go without two-seat fighter jets, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four unnecessary L-159s to a two-seat version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to bringing the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
'The contract clearly states that EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are to be used for training pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the matter of the customer how he realizes the matter", Pejšek said.
The newspaper Económico (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence had not put out a tender procedure for the purchase at the time, but contacted EADS directly.
The then Defence Office argued that this exchange would support future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only uses 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
The purchase of the Casa planes is also likely to have a legal aftermath.
The European Commission has brought a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice, which is why it should have selected the aircraft in the light of a European tender and not by a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last of which is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport in 14 days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men with a thumb longer than a ring finger are obviously at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It's supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially in men up to 60", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick's Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health issues, Ms Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients, but also 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had a shorter index finger on their right hand than their ring finger.
These men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer as 19 percent of men with ring and index fingers.
However, for men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, the risk dropped by 33 percent, and for men up to sixty, by 87 percent.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers mentioned, which are already formed at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone is the same as a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that speeds up the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was only briefly aware of this study, but he still did not believe the relationship between finger length and cancer risk had been "fully proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered with snow, and winter attendants have been on the axis all night in many places.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and vans and the D1 also "stands" near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was reported by Novinky.CZ, the dispatcher of the Central Automobile Motor Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91, a truck collided, at kilometer 93, two trucks collided, and there are injuries in this accident.
There's a couple of cars in the trenches, too.
There are also problems at kilometres 185 of the D1 motorway heading towards Prague.
Two trucks collided here, too.
Drivers should either start at 190 km behind Brno or drive over Brno and start at 182 km at the village of Kývalka.
Because there are miles of traffic jams.
There was also an accident on the D11 just as we were entering Prague.
In Prague itself, there is a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, in the district of Prosek, car roads are formed, and Štěrboholská street is also completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is definitely the subway.
The tram runs with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff will meet.
There are problems on the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven express trains due to snow.
There are problems on the Prague - Kralupy route, for example.
Travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in the southern part of the city are only accessible with increased caution.
Three side roads are completely impassable around Vyškov, snowflakes are gradually forming around Brno and snowflakes are being forced to be used on some of the higher roads around Blansko.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Three roads are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too, snowflakes will have to be used to remove snow.
When they'll be drivable again, we can't tell.
The situation in the Hodonín region is very cautious in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are only allowed to be sprayed with inert streams for nature conservation reasons, there is a snow cover up to five centimetres thick, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, two to ten centimeters of snow fell, most in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimeters.
In the region of Mahrsk-Schlessee up to 15 centimetres of snow fell.
But in the Czech Republic, the snow is slowly dropping.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
For the first time, American forces have deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known only by its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are aimed at the target with a laser with a precision of only a few meters.
The special 25mm caliber bullets designed for this rifle and containing high explosive material function practically like small grenades.
The rounds can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic flight path.
That means it can be used against an enemy hiding behind a wall or a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the deadly steel splinter from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new assault rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically moves this way: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he gains a precise target point, then he corrects the angle of lift, then he just needs to push back.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters".
"When you press down, the gun charges and fires at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
Fujitsu Group is moving its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance industry giant announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad district, in July next year.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, 100 more jobs in the group would be added to the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive and the large offices in Astro Park were more in tune with the way employees worked.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had been merely a tenant.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said: "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent airport connectivity is particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurt economic director Markus Frank (CDU) said that this had won a "global player" once again.
That's a "great location".
Fujitsu is the city's favourite, and the settlement is an important impetus for Niederwijk.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city was informed of the intention early on by the management.
"We obviously offered our help to the company", Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property in Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have given rise to the rash.
Now it's about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent position.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will cooperate".
The house on the town hall used by Fujitsu and the adjacent "Little Verticals" were among the most controversial construction projects in the town square, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Square, ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the train station and the town hall, which was criticized both for the massive construction of the areas previously used as part of the parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still affiliated with Siemens, acquired the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold a year later to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu, which is based in Tokyo, claims to be the world's third largest IT provider.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt am Main, the other subsidiaries at this location are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters were rented from the Astro Park office building.
The twenty-year-old complex - named after its star-shaped floor plan - is home to the Central Association of Electrical and Electronics Industries.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting into trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic posts.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is getting under increasing fire in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous US server and are now looking for a home in Europe.
But the prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is reportedly in Britain, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks is being removed from Amazon's servers".
"Free speech in the land of the free", the disclosure activists shared via short-term news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
A few days earlier, the Internet company Amazon had banned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic messages to manage the high number of accesses to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks went on to explain the move: "Prima - our dollars are now being spent to hire people in Europe".
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped using its servers through WikiLeaks after staff members of Senator Joe Lieberman conducted investigations, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened to boycott Amazon, the Guardian reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this step earlier given the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks", the senator said.
Lieberman called for the platform to be banned from servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, outrageous and reckless actions are putting our national security at risk and endangering lives around the globe", the unpartisan senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to spread stolen material".
WikiLeaks founder Assange, wanted by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, and the exact location is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as a plot by his opponents.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There was even a rumor that Julian Assange was murdered".
That's why Assange is rightly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will keep hiding for the rest of his life.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - apparently ironically - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a fight broke out between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for the recently announced spy calls on diplomats.
"I'm not really sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website", Gibbs says.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his website".
The US government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The White House said that Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism, had been appointed as special agent.
Travers was responsible for developing the "necessary structural reforms" that became necessary after the embassy reports were released by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to see how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be put at risk by the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them", said Foreign Affairs spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary".
The University of the Ice
The Gelato University in Bologna is preparing ice conditioners for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest admission and visitors from around the world.
Where's all the ice coming from?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatino, a German word for ice condenser, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The gelato takes the ice cream from the fridge with a splash, rubs it into the waffle, and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you don't have to go to the Italian company Carpigiani's gelato university.
The University of ICE was established in 2003 by the manufacturer of ice cream machines to ensure that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest number of visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and home-made ice cream practices.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture to the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the land of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke, a business consultant from Berlin, wants to make a living after years of a nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a woman from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste, but also the silky smoothness and consistency are decisive.
But Luciano does not forget the gloss of national and South African architecture in his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and there is still a lot of romance".
The first step to manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers in a large mixing machine that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools it to four degrees.
Then he turns a rooster on the machine, and a pasteurized white base cream comes out, the basis for all milk types.
The lecturer is immediately bombarded with questions: Can ice cream be made with only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one let one's own desire for experimentation run wild?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the times.
If you talk about ice cream "made with only natural ingredients", you may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guarbohydrate flour.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, but you have to sell it within a day or it will just suck and the customer will bite at the ice cream.
Certain variations in the base mass are permitted.
It's getting more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or at the candy stores.
There's also powder and paste.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of flavored additives".
"But you should just experiment".
Or the fruit sauce with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just the white basic cream, which turns to yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate lures.
Now the students can go to the ice machines.
Luciano makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and walnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is being carried out on the fruit varieties.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - not necessarily better in taste.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice is made by the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture can really enhance the flavor of gelato", says Luciano.
Preparation is a calculation task: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice requires extraction of sugar.
Luciano draws a device to measure the sugar content of the fruit (winners use it to measure the grape must's oechsle).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to calculate.
Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only does the machine for automatic production of the base mass help.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously cremated and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, little holes are not missing.
Brazilian Gustavo and his classmates are staining themselves with fruit purée from top to bottom when the oversized stick mixer gets out of hand.
"In every course", says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Controllers in the dark
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
This is now being made by the Expert Group Test Biotech, which considers itself to be an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well", Test Biotech chief Christoph Then said Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA group of experts on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract to the Ilsi lobby group for years.
It's paid for by companies like Monsanto, Nestle, Bayer.
Kuiper has been instrumental in the EFSA testing of genetically modified plants, and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, then criticises.
The EFSA rules are in part equivalent to Ilsi's position papers and thus bear the signature of industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Test Biotech has reported a collision of interests.
A senior EFSA manager recently became a non-obligation or transitional member of the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta and changed sides.
The German Broadcasting Corporation (MDR) also recently revealed staff connections between the EU control authority and industry lobby, which made the Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians very aware.
The EFSA cannot, however, detect any conflict of interest.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
The experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contact with industry.
You'd have to expose them.
Kuiper is awarding his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA.
It describes itself as a neutral forum for experts in science, industry and politics - including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this case, independent experts like Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently being approved without any animal feeding tests and that the response of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what genetically modified corn, for example, does in the field", says Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins but not the entire gene plant, which does not yield reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them?" Then asks.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck thinks.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field, as in the United States and Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers left who are not connected to corporations.
Critical studies for companies would not normally be published.
"The industry controls the safety research", says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also got some, about 400 kilos in total.
On Monday night, he was standing in front of Stuttgart's train station, the tube on his back.
It was a demo.
It was snowing.
The story is familiar: In September, the miners had moved in and had begun to cut off a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against the S21 train station's multibillion-dollar demolition.
When the construction stopped, much of the wing was in ruins.
Break into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim's Muschelkalk, a soft, rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in the Eastern Folds, 43 years old.
He's got a few pieces of the stuff.
"These stones are relics".
"You can't leave".
He exclaims, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthen".
When he fired you, you smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell is too.
The Stuttgart Stones trail leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former French army munitions depot where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing in old stones.
He bought all the people who fell in the demolition of Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were to be ground up or disappear into the landfill", he says in his office, a wooden farmhouse that was once a watchtower.
He was insulted and threatened, he said, when the newspapers said in September that he had bought the remains of the North Wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21s for days.
And he explained to them that there was nothing he could do about the demolition.
And if it does, it would be most reasonable if the stones were to be used again.
About 200 S-21s then took one of the average 80 kg quadrants, priced between 6.50 and 14 euros per piece.
As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of returning it in reconstruction.
500 tons of Rongen, 25 large truckloads.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest are sold out.
Gardeners, landscapers, home builders.
They came from everywhere and they'd dragged away whatever suitcase they could carry and trailers.
The Stuttgart stones of the impact have long since become "walls" or herb-bed confinements.
"This stone is nothing special", says Rongen.
"Were not the political component".
He gets in his RV, takes a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later on, he studied biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And rock lovers.
He's storing 40,000 tons of stone.
He's been collecting his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest antique dealer in the Republic.
It's slowing down.
There are artfully carved sandstones in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Mary Bridge", he says.
Elf sandstone, yellow, warm, it's warming up.
"My favourite stone".
It's going up the road through the woods.
He points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And then there's the next one.
"Beautiful travertine".
Once the Quad was part of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
All over the snow, rocks and stories, cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart Police Headquarters, red granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, tuff from the Heilbron Hospital.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
When Rongen remembers how the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple bottle drawers and ox carts, he becomes quite fearful.
"It would be a scandal to spread such a thing".
He hasn't become rich, not rich at all.
But the stone dealer employs 14 people today, and a carpenter, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the waste reader.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There are stones to save there too.
Talent struggle for high potential
There's a lot of buffet spirit.
16 students are craving salmon buns, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen have invited the students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to work with VW developers to simplify the car of the future - and to get to know Volkswagen.
In the race for the smartest minds, many companies are now entering a close competition, and like VW, they are relying on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: recruit the most talented graduates to the lecture halls as early as possible before they enter the job market and are recruited by others.
And because universities don't issue student achievement reports, they try to track and tie exceptional talent into practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company is promoting the talents.
A young lady in the human resources department is handing out ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with a VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internships and student jobs and shows them ways to get into the corporate world.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits on both sides: "The students are coming into contact with industry and gaining experience".
"VW can also meet students, look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as a worker".
Such cooperation, Selle says, is not unusual.
It's a new thing that students are being so aggressively targeted.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the professional project", says Selle.
The fight for the freshmen is probably gonna get even tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
They must be self-appointed and especially be drawn to highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineers were unemployed in October.
And the so-called engineering gap is going to get even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the accounting and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is on a talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a modern-day sniper hunt where participants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students are being sent across the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can visit KPMG's branches and get to know the company.
The candidate must decide in advance in two rounds.
Only the cream de la crème of the many applicants flies to the United States.
As we stake out the high potential at the universities, the guns are getting bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race".
"Just a simple sail was not enough for us".
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to be going up.
"We have contacts with all participants of a similar campaign last year".
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply for our job soon", he says.
In addition to the direct buffing on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also very classically on the market at trade fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade shows".
"Either on the Intersolar", reports Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stubbe knows about the issue of the young.
The company's website currently lists 35 jobs.
"It's very difficult to occupy vacant positions right now".
"It costs a lot of time and money", she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give us directions to do internships or write graduate theses".
Expensive promotions are not recommended by the solar specialist.
The company is trying to promote this with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large company can't often do that", says HR manager Stübe.
Money is no longer the main factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for upper secondary education are other key factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute draws up an annual best-in-class list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the working conditions.
Staff manager Stübe hopes to gain points from the jobseeker's position.
"I think applicants are particularly looking for external assessments of a potential employer", she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to the warlord, domestic measures in particular.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees", he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, which means creating employer brands within one's own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they'd be promoting themselves to their employers from their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a game with gangs", Krieger says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
The government in Washington has passed a similar ban - and thus has finally revoked its earlier plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig in April.
Before the disaster that killed 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents are thus seeking to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
The responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not been fully clarified.
The criticism is centered on the British energy company BP, which faces billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on the orders of President Obama is to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drill that was imposed after the explosion.
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment and the environment was adopted by the Council on 19 December.
With more controls and more stringent security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another disaster.
The Commission is currently undergoing a major reform of the competent supervisory authority, which has fallen into disrepute following numerous allegations of corruption.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly less than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry", according to a recent industry survey by consultancy firm BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulation will change".
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
Ogon Island is burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a gas station: billions of litres of crude oil spilled have destroyed the nature of Nigeria's Ogon Island.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil-cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is serious.
"Don't worry", the environmental activist reassures the journalists, "you'll still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today".
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to spot a boy swimming in water with the glands around him, but the rainbow-colored water glow almost made the scene look beautiful.
Brown oil spots floating beneath the surface are not visible.
She used to collect shrimp here as a bucket, Esther Badom tells us on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a burst pipeline spilled a huge amount of crude oil into the huge wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach fish-rich waters: Ogon Island, in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
As you travel through the mangrove swamps drawn by the rivers, the full extent of the poisoning becomes apparent.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat boils brown broth, and if you dip your hand in the water, you pull out your oily fingers.
The roots of the mangroves are like black chalk sticks, sadly leaving occasional palms hanging from their trunks.
Bird colonies, as are common in wetlands, are searched in vain: once the outer border is silent, the ghostly tranquility of the former paradise that smells like a gas station spreads.
"What is happening here is environmental warfare", says Celestine Akpobari in a dark tone.
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement is a battleground that has been contested for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe invaded it, in the 1980s, the first resistance was organized by the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, and in 1993 Shell had to stop production because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
The company is still not allowed to return to Ogon Island: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region, which is more than three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogon Island are broken and the company is in a very unstable position.
Every few hundred yards, steel frames emerge from the water like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the holes far too tenderly.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the brim.
A drillhead like this breaks apart over and over again, Akpobari says, and then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that over two billion gallons of oil have been spilled into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that was spilled into the sea off Alaska 21 years ago by the Exxon Valdez supertanker - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
The question of who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed.
While Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see crashed drilling heads and leaky pipelines as the main culprits.
Shell's safety standards in Nigeria are much lower than in the rest of the world, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008 of saying that the rate of faulty pipes alone is "many times higher than anywhere else".
In a place that looks like an abandoned oil-lubricated workshop in the open, figures appear from the mangroves: they are split-naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, some of which are connected to pipes, some of which are randomly scattered on the grounds, a fire is brewing: an illegal small refinery.
The crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours in the barrel, explains Michael, the group's head.
First, gasoline enters the capture tank through the pipes, then it drips out kerosene at the end of the line, and finally diesel.
So Michael and four of his associates produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel a day.
Delta residents are using the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With a ridiculously low price of almost 40 cents a liter of diesel, illegal cooks can still undercut the price because they get their raw materials for free.
It comes from bunkers that tap the pipeline network across Ogon Island, where experts say the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil a day across the Niger Delta.
However, only a tiny fraction of the interim raw material is illegally processed: the lion's share is being filled in by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, in tankers and smashed onto the world market.
The debate over whether the environmental disaster is more likely to be caused by population overcrowding or the lax production mode is considered academic by activist Akpobari.
"If the oil companies had not been perceived as invaders and had not destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen so thoroughly, there would have been no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries".
The Ogoni relationship with Shell has been so damaged that only one subsidy from the group is in question: 'Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese are better off.'
Michael's getting really nervous.
"Time for you to go", says the muscular oilman.
"The soldiers can come any minute".
If the special forces catch the illegal oil refiners, they are not in danger of arrest but of a painful bribe.
The soldiers, mainly from the north, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn thing has got our country on the dog in every way", Akpobari says.
Investigators are detecting dangerous engine failure in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible engine failure in an emergency machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas Airlines is now suing the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that was hit by an emergency at the beginning of November were apparently much happier than they had been before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s in its investigation - and now warns of a possible engine failure.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil tube connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB said in a statement published on Thursday.
This could have led to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Commission has also examined the compatibility of the measures with the common market.
Among them is the Qantas airline, which made an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint in an Australian federal court in Sydney that allows her to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline will be seeking damages for the incident in early November.
The engine fire had dissolved parts and damaged the carrier surfaces.
Rolls-Royce set off an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines involved.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas aircraft landed for emergency, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its 11 A380.
Lufthansa switched the engine on an A380 as a precaution.
The twin-engined aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Countrywide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany in white: overnight snow has fallen almost all over the country.
Many roads are in chaos, trains and flights fail.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: In freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowed on Thursday night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, some of the snow cover is 15 centimeters thick.
On several motorways and on many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, winter service was in continuous operation, but was not able to cope with the constantly rising snow.
In addition, heavy rains swept over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Transport and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting storm surges of 1.2 metres above normal at Schleswig-Holstein on the Baltic coast from this morning.
In Saxony, snowfall on motorways and federal roads caused considerable problems.
According to the Meteorological Center, the alert level in Saxon Switzerland was therefore set in violet - the highest level ever.
Some of the snow fell 30 centimeters [30 inches] and fresh and strong winds caused constipation.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there that night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind caused traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the rails, trees on the rails collapsed or overhead lines and lanes destroyed are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringia Salfeld, an ICE to Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were provided with wool blankets, food and drinks by firefighters and rescue workers on board.
Snow winds were sweeping the streets.
At large German airports, the snow-blasts cause numerous flight failures.
In Munich, a spokeswoman for the Flight Information Centre said that several cancellations had already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, a Fraport spokeswoman said 40 flights had already been cancelled.
The winter service is in full operation.
Although there were few stranded passengers at the airport, they still had nearly 400 field beds available.
On many roads there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a railway junction in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here too, a truck was caught at a railway crossing because the vehicle stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she hit her car on a smooth road near Aschaffenburg.
But the good news for the meteorologists is that although the snow will still be soft and powdery, it will still be vibrating at light bad weather.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by strong and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: according to a newspaper report, the bank is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could be contributed to the property.
The German Bank has just made its Group headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurt Banking district have been modernised; in the meantime the bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplaces.
But now the financial group is apparently trying to recoup the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the Financial Times Germany reports, citing a spokesman.
The speaker did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell properties yourself and then back off", he said.
The largest German credit institution is thus resigning its head office shortly afterwards.
The bank had only acquired the twin towers from investors in a home fund in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million and subsequently extensively renovated them.
The energy conversion was estimated at around EUR 200 million.
I think a sale would make the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, now renamed "Greentowers", to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor is currently still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn their dead mate
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the miners who were killed after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been recovered because the safety situation in the accident pit is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped in the wreckage but had not detected any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces were unable to descend for safety reasons.
After the second blast, authorities and experts had assumed there was no chance of survival for the two of them.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth, New Zealand's South Island.
They'll be silent for two minutes.
In honor of the scattered miners, 29 tables were set up, showing helmets, lamps, and the names of the companions.
Images and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
The flags were waving half-masted in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the memorial service.
"But they never came home".
He couldn't finish his son's death unless he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was dumped in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial service.
The first explosion on 19 November also killed British and South African miners.
Rescue workers started extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the explosive gases are removed, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warriors!
Is Splatter a good place for a movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is re-examining the old boundaries of the genre with his fight epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have been thinking of when he made "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents with almost superhuman forces in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid methods of killing and sometimes pulls his enemies out of the living body when in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says the whole film without a word, and the other characters can be tempted to say at most one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, silence will be observed and the scary hilly landscape of Scotland will be swallowed up, setting the scene for the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera trips.
It's nice when a movie has multiple audiences, but it's a shame if they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art-cinema fans are likely to be intimidated by the brain mass and gut that are spraying around them.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for reasons that can be interpreted freely, Einauge leaves for Jerusalem with a force of violent Christian missionaries aboard a ship and is stuck in a fog and fog for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and keeps silent there.
No wonder Walhalla Rising didn't find a cinema in Germany and is now only available on DVD.
This is especially unfortunate because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody façade is hidden a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has earned some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a strict act, it's all atmosphere, a movie-made fever dream.
And there's no escape for the viewer.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation, slowly strapping his throat with his icy images and dark trance-like soundtrack, but most of all with the unfathomable hatred that hits him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who stands by the side with one eye keeps himself something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who becomes an enemy and temporary ally eventually a warrior from hell, perhaps an ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the corrupt anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to anger, upset and amazement.
It was an experience.
Mysterious Earthwork
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this, and it does not allow checks.
At midnight on September 5 and 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighters attacked a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is on the Euphrates River; the nearest major city, 30 miles [30 km] away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with North Korean help in the quadrant, hidden in a valley that runs out of electricity.
According to a briefing by the CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of El-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - the material from which nuclear weapons could be built.
In contrast, the technology of the 1950s is hardly suitable for other purposes.
The CIA was conducting a video presentation with thin satellite images.
By computer animation, she blurred out what components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
She also showed pictures of the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was said to be in operation shortly before the start of the operation, but it had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little is known about it than then, and the mysteries have become much bigger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was pretty sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in al-Kibar, it saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more careful and only talk about an "alleged reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, and so does the IAEA.
Asked how certain he was of having a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer only replied lapidar that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The Syrians quickly put aside the debris of the supposedly "unused military building" and thoroughly planned the site.
However, in June 2008, a IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the immediate aftermath of the attack via a Member State, which are likely to be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analysing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as has the satellite images.
It also denies inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this", Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
The investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008, and "increasingly becomes a serious credibility issue for the Authority", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - after all, there is a serious breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the space overseen by the IAEA.
The IAEA seems to see three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor as a key to progress in the investigation - and that are still in existence.
The inspectors have not yet disclosed what plants they are, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, which in turn are derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these sites and located a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or near a military base - and that's why Syria denies the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to scour military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had been alerted to the facilities by a tip from the U.S. intelligence community.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the Euphrates Quadrant.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing, processes necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is run on unenriched uranium.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium would later be extracted for the bomb, there are at least plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It's also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces was stored at the three sites.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to know where the trash is.
The Salzmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria tested in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste dump, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked the reactor to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the orbiting images show that Syria was working on the three suspicious sites and removing large containers after the IAEA requested access.
It may be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent several months developing an inspection plan there that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - the effort alone shows how much interest the inspectors have.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had reassured them a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, the matter was not urgent, for example, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting in place special inspections for a few months, one of the most powerful means the Vienna nuclear intelligence has to enforce controls.
The IAEA's head, Yukiya Amano, who should propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this path: first, it requires a majority in the IAEA's governing council, and many of the 35 countries represented there are far from poised for escalation.
The second is, like a diplomat, thinking, "What if they don't find anything?"
Love in Wartime
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her as-yet-unnamed directorial debut this summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
There's not much else to know about it, but that's enough to cause a stir.
The rumor is that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's organisations immediately protested, and some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary shortly afterwards.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it's still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization wrote to Jolie about UNHCR's refugee agency and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper reported - Jolie is herself a UN refugee agency ambassador.
It is not diplomatic - it has offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they have refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended that the UN Refugee Agency dismiss Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her script to be read, has, after some time, granted permission to shoot Sarajevo - it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't show up anyway.
The young author herself claims that she has no political intentions with her film, has worked hard to get involved in the Yugoslav conflict, to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all parties involved.
However, the content of the report remains vague.
So a second synopsis of the film is circling online, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it before the war broke out and then they meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different than the "rape victim falls in love with torturer" version.
That Jolie's movie actually started before the war, that's for sure.
Jolie said the pressure on her was "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now, I think the only way to bring peace is for Hollywood hackers to do it, by illegally putting the script online like so many others have done before.
Nothing like getting out of here
This evening, the Irish are finally getting along.
No sign of grief.
For this reason, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
Fans are shouting for joy at loud music, they are clapping their feet.
Bailey pub in southern Cork is shaking because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cans and hit.
"Beerpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there's a 500 euro prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Cup of Beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this crafty drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, who doesn't really fit together.
Yet the 26-year-old tries to have fun, distracting himself from the perplexing question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play games in Vegas, he's gonna be conducting interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a very dull feeling about it", he says.
"It's so far from home and I still don't have a job there".
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a crush on her job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign", says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: It's like the tanners on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts at the ESRI Institute for Economic and Social Research in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they're even expecting 200,000 immigrants.
A huge loss for the small country of only 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that in Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of boom that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain for the young, well-educated Irish people who have been so far upside down.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was abundant.
But now three out of ten women and men under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times has a number of letters from young immigrants complaining: "Everything is going down in Ireland".
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation".
"The last one, please turn off the light".
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a bleak future because the government is blinking its eyes and no longer offers young people any hope for the future.
"They're cutting the minimum wage, but they don't have a strategy for creating new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students hike from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing".
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to take the issue positively.
McLarnon is organising the WorkingAbroadExpo, a trade fair offering a comprehensive service on working abroad.
"For a beginner, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps in a career", says the manager.
His website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Sean O'Donovan has known for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had nothing left to do in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction projects in Germany.
They're building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, we'll continue to Hanover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home country now, because he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a little crazy", he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm almost never in again".
He's a little embarrassed and walking through cool rooms.
The small house is in a fine residential area with well-maintained outbuildings, with large, expensive cars parked in the entrances.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100% credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions", he says.
Is he worried about the credit going to go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea, and says, "I don't have children to feed, and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over".
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he hears often right now.
"No one needs to go hungry - our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps it makes us feel like Irish".
He laughs and tells us about his father, who moved to England during the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life in Ireland continued, quite simply".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Let the future unfold and just watch how life goes elsewhere.
He's already done a few years in London, and why shouldn't he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that is worrisome to him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might turn into a farewell party.
"Don't blow too many emotions", he says, and drinks a big sip of his beer.
"That sounds scary, though".
"Let's call it a party, a party, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games".
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is the support for private enterprises.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results were obtained from the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus reflects the change of opinion in the region.
Two facts are particularly relevant in this year's September and October surveys.
Firstly, the good mood in Latin America
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are fully used.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at about 6% a year since 2002, the number of pro-democracy supporters rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This is also the case in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since the sharp decline last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practices, as much as last year but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% of the population trust the Congress and 45% the government, both figures comparable to last year but showing a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This continued even during the global economic crisis may be because Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were accommodated by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from this week's UN Economic Commission for Latin America, poverty in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again by 32% this year.)
However, there are significant differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread progressive thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more pronounced and violent crime increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the survey began, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a larger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Some 31% say they or a family member was the victim of a crime last year, but compared with 38% last year, the figures have fallen to their lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the private and market economies: about 71% of respondents across the region said that the private economy is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% said that only the market economy could bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), despite the fact that their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
Brazil has the largest share of the population in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The United States, on the other hand, is the most influential country among respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, with Venezuela taking over the role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote of no confidence
No one expected the elections on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the voters who rushed to help the country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballots in the drain, polling stations destroyed and intimidation were just some of the problems.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom had been homeless in the January earthquake, were wandering around looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some of the most prominent presumed leaders, demanded the cancellation of the election results due to an alleged fraud.
There were violent protests all over the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is supposedly committed to the unpopular President-elect René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected selection is scheduled for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rapper Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity suit.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no voter support, is declared the winner of the general election by the polling station, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by lack of organization.
Shortly before the election, about 250,000 voting IDs were still not distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government to be an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
The Haitian people themselves are of the same opinion.
Hidden in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of her husband, Argentine President Cristina Fernández experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate up 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
But whether this will help her to win re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also directed economic policy after his wife's election, often made budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income in their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27 led to further decay.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists supported Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one MP slapped another in the face and others blamed the government for bribery) Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this", the President said.
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money at his discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is 11.1%, for example, but many private estimates - and wage demands by the unions - propel the figure to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was hit by economic crises, declared growth and poverty alleviation as his main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census, INDEC, which then refined the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernandez take a more moderate course now?
She called on the private sector and union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases are set to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth boost by a major devaluation in 2002.
It is possible that Cristina Fernández would like to re-connect Argentina financially with the rest of the world for this reason.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with shareholders who had rejected the country's previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for a deal with the Paris Club's funders, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected an IMF review, as is the custom elsewhere.
However, last month, Minister of Economy Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after the end of her term.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, who are largely fed up with churchmanism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy they have received will be subdued.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to quietly cancel many of her husband's political decisions.
We have a weak applause for China.
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters, took part in the five municipal districts to elect mayors and city councillors, a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building pioneering business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself has become a symbol of mainland relations.
Ma passed the exam, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) has three of the five mayors, it has not received a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports greater Taiwanese independence, received almost 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
In the event of a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the city councils.
During the election, the usual Taiwanese events occurred, such as truck convoys with crawlers, flag-waving mass movements and scarce-clothed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
Lian was wounded and a spectator was killed.
Bizarrerweiser is not sure if the shooter was trying to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
The mainland relations were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the forefront.
But this time, the DPP also avoided too much anti-Chinese sentiment.
It was a response to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
I am sure it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It's better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was a strong advocate of absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians has emerged and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the working class and youth.
Tsai was a popular candidate for the DPP presidency, as was Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything it can to show that it is also capable of building close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to forge an idea as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trusted alternative" to Mas's rapid approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged the pragmatist Su to forgo the presidential nomination.
Even without Chen's intervention, the DPP has difficulty choosing its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
But the values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet and local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a limited amount of reconciliation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
When you speak at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for the Grammy for Newcomer of the Year.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album Esperanza in 2008, the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it is in line with Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released a maximum of three albums before releasing the album with which he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward, and with her vocal range and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding is easily compared to 2003's Norah Jones, whose big breakthrough as a jazz performer in 2003 comes closest to Spalding's nomination in this category.
The album "Historicity" by the Vijay Iyer trio was also nominated in the instrumental albums category.
Iyers' competitors include "Moody 4B" by the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans rapper's favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was awarded the Contemporary Jazz category, which otherwise features albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the big band category, thus joining the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octave, whose live album "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classics
The classics nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The list is preceded by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles".
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestral, opera, choral to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the classical albums nominated are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House"; Adolf Hass' "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos' "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins' "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Mariinsky Theatre's orchestra and choir; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
The Symphony No. 4 of Paris was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salones.
The 30-minute piece, titled "Los Angeles", is dedicated to the former oil tycoon Mikhail Chodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinen Concert" was nominated in the Instrumental Solo with Orchestra category.
The L.A. composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and a lot of North African tones and rhythms", Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated as vocalists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula gains approval from the Planning Committee
After a five-hour, often heated, public hearing, the construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in compliance with local regulations and will be an aesthetic sight.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others", said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"As an American, I'm proud of that".
"It shows that justice is in play".
"There are few opponents", he added.
"They're just very loud".
"Wonderful people live in this valley".
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and the discussions for and against the center's construction lasted almost until midnight, with votes on both sides distributed fairly evenly, according to the press enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore", was a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand".
"America is at an end".
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger, better place than the warehouse they rented with a water filter manufacturer.
The new Mediterranean-style mosque, which is about 2,300 m2, is to have two minarets and rise to about 13 m in height.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could create new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial species that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities".
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow".
"That makes it very special, even though it's almost a kind of 'foreign' life form", explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as scientists have found, the bacteria in Mono Lake, California, grow even more when they replace phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible", said co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, Anbar says.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were made has given rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report may be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms can start biochemical processes in other planetary systems with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely necessary for life are not necessarily fixed", explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at Milton Keynes Open University in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another", Cockell added.
This discovery was not a coincidence.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high content of arsenic.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both could possibly replace one element with another.
"Arsenic's toxicity is primarily due to its chemical behavior similar to that of phosphorus".
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another".
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus, entering our biochemical system, where it lubricates virtually everything", Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic, which adapted and grew.
While the microbes grow better in phosphorus, their ability to survive in arsenic also shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than in the early Earth age", said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibit dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibit dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.
The four exhibitors - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknown persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were staying outside a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two Wednesday night, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are fine", Whitmore says.
"They are in good condition".
"They were returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore did not give any specific information about the dogs' whereabouts or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing".
"We don't want to say anything more about it", explains Whitmore.
"We're tracking some tracks".
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs to a local animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old female, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek were planning to introduce to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, were missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to compete.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs were supposed to be in other competitions in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly one-month dog show tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stayed in motels and parked their vans outside their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a boxing puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was colder there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs could breathe.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finder's fee, and the animals were implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's fee would be paid.
The lion is roaring again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge officially approved Thursday the "prepared" credit plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. competition law, so there's no longer any way to re-launch MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually take effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At present, a consortium of investment banks, which itself generates $75 million, is running the company.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the commission to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM's financial concerns and pay off the studio's more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted few bidders and none of them paid the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started fresh when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which after months of debate and internal disputes was finally signed by creditors in late October.
If MGM officially goes bankrupt in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, receives a $4 million "success bonus".
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and drew up a yearly schedule of seven or eight films to be released in theaters in early 2012.
They're also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of MGM's loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies have not yielded any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget balanced
The favorite among the gifts this year is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can make a big hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while a Kinect game costs about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I went to three national toy retailers looking for three $80-under electronic toys -- a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's Law had come into force, and this year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost slightly less than last year.
And while fewer new toys are coming out with their own website, the most well-known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a wider range.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children 3 and up) are plush figures the size of a sea pig that sing a note when pressed on its belly.
One press is equal to one note, and one can play a song by pressing it multiple times.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs singing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start pushing, you can't stop.
For a combination of messenger and dance, the dance star Mickey (previously $60, for children 2 and up) is the best choice.
Based on Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers games of turn-based action like 'Simon Says', and thanks to its innovative wheel-blocking hinge foot, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Kids who tested the device used Mickey as a dance instructor, but their parents complained about the lack of sound control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you probably remember Alfie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Play School, $40, for kids 3 and up) with a bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a class, with a better-knowing teacher with autocorrection.
If you don't want your child to trust your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60 for children ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children ages 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen, after Leapfrogs' first major revamp of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price iXL ($90 for children ages 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and the SD card drive allows family photos to be viewed on it.
Finally, there's Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for kids 8 and up), the five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before time runs out.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy store just to see what's on offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet in Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match figure pack ($5 for children 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will get enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two more parts.
It could be roller shoes or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head-cell-powered microbot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for kids ages 5 and up), is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone bones in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a bog of mud.
And he's been through a lot.
Our dog fell from the kitchen table and even survived a while in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting smoother
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped through a city square, checking his nervous subjects, and giving orders with military authority and a silent voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's tough guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and inclination to violence - to impress viewers.
"Stand still!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them", he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely out of their teens, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants, stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four decent hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-and-white stripes.
"They look average to me", Mr. Tang remarks disdainfully.
"Models are beautiful".
Several governments have already tried to uplift the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a college degree.
Guangdong province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of grey greens.
In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled a poorly-set dining car and stared at the operator until he packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the city police force, and they have been selected for their special appearance, good looks and youth.
You're supposed to give the rude police a softer, more feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
The critics are right.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce municipal laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat to death a spectator who used his cell phone to film them holding a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual was stolen from Beijing officials and posted online describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handshake with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan is scaring the government", the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy surrounding the tactics.
The paper called for a "really thorough cleanup".
Skeptics consider the current approach to the problem to be clearly inadequate.
When the district announced its recruitment of eight women in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real duties or were to serve only as a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job description, women aged 18 to 22 were sought after with good looks and "harmonious facial features".
They should be above average - over six feet or six feet, two and a half inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
Officials say that for women over 25, the activity is too physically demanding.
"The most important thing is their image", an unnamed district official told the government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc".
Then comes temperament and inner qualities.
"Chengguan women are like vase-flowers", he said, adding, "but they also have other duties".
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the Municipal Administration of the District, does not wish to attach this description,
But he admitted that in China, size requirements in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether that is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use cripples or bugs here", Mr Zheng said.
"Your image would not be good".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pie and a well-formed mouth.
She didn't feel sexist that she was so highly regarded.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with a wry look.
Her colleague with the spots, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "Our job is to represent the image of the city".
They say they do not regret the short-term hiring because they have more ambitious career plans than simply sneaking traders through the streets to stop them from doing business.
Every morning, the street vendors are about a dozen, trying to sell as many loaves and pastries as possible on foot or on bicycles before they are chased.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here".
"We've told you so many times!" explains Ms. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and temporarily abandoned his bicycle-mounted noodle kitchen.
The officials say the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day", explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in her spare time.
"All routine".
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate merchants' goods like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten criminals by reporting them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which is common to officials in China.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, raided after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared such violent protests so far.
But riots are not excluded.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk, not in a workshop, contrary to regulations.
The owner was yelling Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers, with grim faces, headed for their vehicles and continued on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Liedong, 40, a male police coordinator, stayed behind, turning his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're going to be verbal".
"Sometimes, though, physically", Mr Li soberly explains.
"Most of the time, people start arguing".
Prosecutor will not prosecute Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign of the charges brought against him after his affair with a former campaign manager and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's attorneys announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the toughest legal case ever brought against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada, until the scandal that made national headlines and put a lid on his career, he was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after a year of investigation.
But the Senate Ethics Committee could issue a disciplinary order.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Justice Department that the investigation into Senator Ensign had been suspended and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The verdict came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who believe there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents first leaked to the New York Times in October 2009 led to speculation that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his campaign aides, was using lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was treasurer during Ensigns' campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton a job, and according to the documents and interviews, he took over for them after hiring Hampton's lobbying.
Hampton was recently on Ensign's campaign team, so he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on door-to-door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "this appears to be a collusion and a breach of the turn-door statutes", says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the Ensign case decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appears to be very cautious in taking political charges after a series of defeats that were followed by the media with great interest, including last year's decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrible", said Melanie Sloan, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's chief defense attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, telling him that the department would not press charges against its clients.
Mr. Ensigns's defenders had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not going to go into the details of the talks between the Ministry of Justice and myself, just so to speak: we think we made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to suspend the investigation over a separate lawsuit by the ethics group alleging a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The Election Commission said there wasn't enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbying work with the help of Mr. Ensign.
An email from December 2008 proves that after the company moved Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings' chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, telling him that he was "knocking at the Home Office about a case".
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
When information about this affair first reached the public last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position in the Senate, where he had been ranked fourth in the Republican ranks.
After being out of the loop for months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes the ethics committee will follow the example of the Justice Department very quickly and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in serving the people of Nevada", she said.
Cheshire vocation draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing themselves into the courtroom crawl.
In a minute, they tweeted their reports of horrific testimonies.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter posts about the rape trial and the bed-bound children in a house that was on fire.
On Thursday, the carefully-tracked trial of Steven J. Hayes, accused of killing three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, will officially end when the verdict on the death penalty handed down by the jury falls.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed court applications setting out the grounds for an appeal that will take years for the courts to process.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting of the trial - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has led to a "circus atmosphere" and a widespread, swift penetration of riotous details, so that the jury has been unacceptably influenced by public outrage.
This objection could lead the courts of appeal to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this trial, I believe that it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' chief counsel.
Chief Justice Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of Appeals, last week, conclusively rejected the applications by a decision that the New Media would be "carefully monitored" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court cases have found that reporting on famous-notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 ruling, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath in Cleveland who is believed to have killed his wife, and said in its ruling that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the movie "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court cases that consider Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media on lawsuits that are being prosecuted by the general public", said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has researched the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication outside the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' lawyers are setting out to debate for years, thus delaying a conviction.
The defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrific crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jury members said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, filled them with disgust.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge had mistakenly replaced a jury who had been a critic of the prosecution and that he had exerted unacceptable pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jury wasn't isolated.
But perhaps their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process are of the greatest interest.
In an appeal they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was being discussed by candidates during the campaign for governor and U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continually reignited the flames of emotion about the case.
"Such a daily rush of media picks, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom", wrote the lawyers, "has never been seen before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide".
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that the claim that these direct messages are more elaborate than reports that are replicated more slowly is a technically hostile view that undermines the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyers are reinforcing that claim.
In their objection, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction for reporting and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "represents Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century".
Can politeness bind the breakup?
After a campaign of slander and negativity, little politeness has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and top congressmen on Tuesday did not bring about a breakthrough in the big issues to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions are made.
From what we hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different parties nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party-listed score.
The President's public meeting of the Committee on the Deficit on Wednesday was similarly civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that masks the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
That's hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one demanding the other's sign of cooperation and compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a new party war.
The meeting itself on Tuesday and its assessment by the participants were therefore limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health care or the arts, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November elections have been a mild vote for Washington for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after the election.
Elections are a party passion that dies out again.
And that's good".
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.'
Bush's tax cuts are coming to an end this year, and no one's supporting it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferred tax cuts for the rich are being made while they deny support to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there has been increased optimism that these issues can be agreed during the lame duck session and ratified at the same time as the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of inconsistency is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be turned into confrontation", he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening from now until 2012 as a pre-struggle, or shadow box, for the main event of 2012", he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the rise of the new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who served their formation.
As worried as Republican leaders may be about playing too much poker, they know they need to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and roll back health care reform.
These lines are already evident in the first reactions to the Commission's recommendations on deficits, which include tax reform and the raising of certain taxes, the raising of the retirement age and the reduction of public expenditure.
Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pressed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes in the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Committee, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for compromise or sympathy.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party collisions, when Republicans challenge Obama on the state budget, taxes and health care system, followed later by a larger phase of bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that despite the biases of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, both sides must be careful about public reaction.
Whoever's condemned to lose will have to change course and find a compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Party and polarization are bigger today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological divide between Obama and the congressional Republicans than it was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans back then.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a much wider election of 2012 in terms of consequences.
The courtesy shown this week is welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground in the issues that still separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The city is controlled by the "cleptocracy" and it is passing some of the bribe money and the protection it collects to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the State Security Service are reportedly blackmailing high-profile security funds to keep their expensive living standards in Moscow.
They're not just raising money from legitimate businesses, they're raising money from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" - takes its share of the money that moves up the ladder.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on his homepage by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there's hardly any evidence that he's been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption charges over the years, and he has won numerous libel cases against such charges.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian television station: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty".
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual, as the ambassador's report shows, for individuals to be named, and it is unheard of for a foreign diplomat to do so.
"The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it 'disorderly' and conclude that the government is more of a kleptocrat than a government", the memo says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'kryshna' (a term from the criminal/mafia world, which literally means 'roof' or protection) that extends across the police, the State Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Defence (MVD) and the Prosecutor's Office as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-tiered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is in the top spot".
"FSB, MVD and militia are on the second level".
"Last, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom level".
"This is an incompetent system where criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any assistance".
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the biggest companies and that the police arrest small business people.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because not only do they have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but they are also protected by law".
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as it used to be".
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is extensive, the protection itself will not be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - for one reason or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy memo contains descriptions of men entering the Kremlin with suitcases that were believed to be full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats", Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"It's not part of the political class because there is no political class in Russia anymore".
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo from the American embassy, which took place late in the evening after Moscow time, will certainly provoke disapproval within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are being solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country", he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know".
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty, leafy walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to face publicly those who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time told the history of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian community tribunal first convicted a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society more difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil".
"It's even dividing families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to the government, leading to the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was awaiting trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are rooted in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime".
"They grew up without any professional knowledge".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat".
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to trial.
The court's task is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it has not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has done little to ease the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told a Cambodian documentation center commissioner that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that killed thousands of forced labourers.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her log cabin on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to summon her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability", she said.
"If there were no more persecution, there would be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court indicted more suspects, although experts and historians debate this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means putting together the broken pieces", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that as everything can understand".
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's High School History Book, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court", he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be convicted by the court".
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence", he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a powerful appeal here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with bushes and covered with plastic debris leads to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a rusty brick roof.
Pol Pot's body was cremated here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a street vendor, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray", she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she'd lay a bush of ripe bananas - hoping it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to stop collecting weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and it seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
But U.S. government officials told The Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about 500 pounds, according to an official who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's April nuclear security summit, which Belarus excluded.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012)".
"This proves to me that it works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did it under George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs out of it and we're not going to sell it to anyone".
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the draft budget.
The first attempt to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that stretches more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second takeoff was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The US government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money going to Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative at the Department of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Extended Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012 under the joint agreement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's gross disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens", it explains.
No objection from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA's flights of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as shown in a telegram from the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in documents leaked by WikiLeaks and transmitted to the daily El País (by cable), adding that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are properly monitored".
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing the aid to human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassadors Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega met.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the Council's report had 'hit Zapatero aside' and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed", Aguirre reports by cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also told the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges".
In January 2007, the Prosecutor General, Vicente González, informed the Embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information", the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than the declassified information from the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly between governments", complained Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba commented that "although the Spanish judges are madly concerned about their independence and are doing what they think is appropriate", he instructed his staff to "avoid bloated rhetorical comments to ease the tension".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that, from an indication that the US government has tolerated or deliberately ignored Zapatero's actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, capital will be hit even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government", he stresses.
The child killer admits to complaining on the Internet about the "harassment" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet.
She has been using this nickname since childhood and has been in contact with a cousin and at least one friend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructed based on testimonies from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with industrialist Iván Túñez in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she ended their relationship, it was revealed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do a DNA test.
Soon after, she entered into another relationship.
The one chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But the content of their messages suggests that their love affair broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, while alone in Menorca, she wrote: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work".
"When I told him, he liked it, but now he naturally realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free to do and let do what he wants".
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy".
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back".
In May, she says of her return to her village: "This week I am going there, but I will stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I do not want to lose it".
She explains that she'll take her firstborn with her if all goes well.
"He'll be with who he needs to be, that is, with me, and I'll never leave him with anyone else in my life except my mother", a dubious intention given their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
As she writes, the boy who arrived on the island on the first of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is believed to be dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not".
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day".
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to attend a summer school there, so I have less money to spend on babysitting".
On the 17th, memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you're coming".
"Alberto says he emailed me some videos, you see, if he wants to, he finds me, like, shit".
And then one at 30, "The boy is fine. He's going to a summer class to learn Catalan".
One of her current partners, Víctor, says: "He's throwing me money".
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages about her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now blocked, and she called herself "Muki, the Prison Breakers".
"Terror a la gallega" is the title.
The last man who lived with her, an oath-taking hunting overseer, declares he has a conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe it happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mom.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the Court of Prisoners in Menorca to the Palma Provincial Prison.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not recall the course of the case, "and she had no intention of causing the minor harm".
She had previously confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and to having his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor's office have requested a psychiatric opinion.
Popular Party won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
The results of 28 November could be a decisive factor in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
The PP is already looking to the parliamentary elections, whether they are preferred or not, after the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections.
The Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, compared with only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - a result of the diversion of the PSC's voting share and the binding of the PP's constituency - were to continue, PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 MPs, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for the PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while the ICV could retain or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next municipal elections will be held in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the balance to end socialist dominance in four provincial capitals and with its majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists cannot win a majority or rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debate, it is not inconceivable that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, where it would have to get 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, increased its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in the Tarragona revolution, where they ruled with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus, the People's Party also saw a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers arrested by the Barcelona Police Intelligence Service were part of the Thai-led jihadist cell that provided passports to various al Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Laschkar e-Taiba (Let), the latter of which was responsible for the bombings in Bombay in 2008 that claimed 106 lives.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, saying that the "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaeda's counterfeit apparatus worldwide and "hence its capability to act".
The researchers estimate that during the two years the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries without punishment.
The cell was not the only one of the jihadist networks active in Europe, so other European police units were involved in the investigation, besides the Thai investigating bodies.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another operation was carried out in Thailand, in which Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had run the cell from Bangkok, Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole tourist passports in accordance with the guidelines of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents must be issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 and valid for several years; they must not be stamped with a visa.
Investigative circles stress that no link between those arrested in Catalonia and the Bombay attack has been established so far, although the author of the attack, 'Laschkar e-Taiba', was one of the recipients of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several days before the assassination in Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid mobile phone cards, which were later used by the members of the "commando" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated a large amount of documentation.
PP demands that Mas postpone the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took yesterday the opportunity to present to Mr Mas in person the conditions for his candidacy as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are no different from those already put forward during the campaign and can be summed up by the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regional leader wants to propose at the height of his term.
The President of the Catalan People's Party was sure to address Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to make her feel indispensable, because the candidate from the CiU party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to cast their vote in his inauguration.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to make in the upcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible alliance with the PP.
As regards the PPC's party chairman, it calls for the establishment of 'all discussions concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia' and an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to that in the Basque Country - to be held in the background in support of the candidacy, and which the CiU leader wants to hold a referendum.
Both political leaders agree that they want to streamline the structured political apparatus of regional administration and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations for Mas's accession are being discussed by the PPC's Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mr Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot nursing home do not rule out that their nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot, Gerona, held a press conference yesterday, where they revealed the damage done to the facility by the criminal activities of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who killed at least 11 elderly people in his care during his work.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to charge the person responsible (for the deaths) " but "the law and our responsibility compel us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must accept a loss of social standing not only because it failed to establish the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but also now pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities were handled by telephone because of their age and illness.
The head of La Caritat denied this point and stated that "the remaining measures could not have been the reason for the incidents at any time".
The La Caritat lawyer added that "there were no indications of negligence by any person other than the accused in the proceedings".
The already "angel of death" baptized confessed to 11 murders the day before and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and a month and a half later that he had murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat stated that access to medicines by staff was difficult to control.
The nurse used insulin injections and sedative cocktails on six of the nine crimes committed to relieve the dying patients of their suffering.
But the results of the lab tests will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them from within by administering bleach, as he confessed to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, the nurse's testimony is not believed, not even in terms of the number of confessed murders, which could be much higher, and this view is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they were there for that reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
The European Central Bank (ECB) threat signs
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to react".
The risk outputs of the euro area countries have increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be wrong and that the euro has barely accumulated points, which is a cause for concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market which is recovering to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which means that tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years and probably several times in the future, the ECB will have to back down.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the public debt purchase plan as it was ineffective and for the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, with only one week of unlimited access to be maintained.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended 'at least until March' and quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity to be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase programme to continue and to send a stronger signal.
If the expectations set are not met, the excellent response of yesterday's markets will be thrown back and if we are persistently urged to withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB meeting in May, when the Bank confirmed that it would not consider buying government bonds and that markets would collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday, she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new market crash.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The State Administration spent only 500 million at 5.28%, compared with 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in market perception, according to Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt gap between Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The sum is estimated at around 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000 million.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after failing to recognize the problem of stress tests in July, the figures under the bailout plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
The Commission has already decided to adopt a new budget for the year 2000 and to adopt a new one for the year 2000.
Angela Merkel has made her speech more moderate in view of the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where political unity is called for to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the action plan, which is due to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as in financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation measures, measures that are in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The Zapatero and Trichet double effect explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was rapid and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are putting a strong demand on it that will eliminate all doubt about our ability to redeem.
For Spain, applying for a plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity we don't need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now not only being matters, but appearance".
Just be brave, we can do this!
The President of the Board of Directors of Eulen is appealing to the Vega Sicilia meeting of shareholders at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the companies Oulen and El Enebro, is not going away.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge the meeting of shareholders of El Enebro, which will be held on 16 May at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers it "absolutely void".
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing legal action for a new chapter in their dispute over control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not appear to be willing to give up control of El Enebro's institutions in his dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children who were appointed to the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The meeting of the El Enebro shareholders, convened by the Judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the heart of the Álvarez family.
The summons of the judge to hold the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the general meeting.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a 'desperate means by which the applicants - his five children - are able to obtain recognition of the 18 January meeting which was declared void by means of legal tricks, fraudulent machinations and abuse of the law', as stated by official spokesmen.
This argument is the basis for the congregation's appeal in retrospect to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who are quietly hiding, tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting in June.
At El Enebro, a holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
The company's services group is, on the other hand, entitled to 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
That is the actual background of the case which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are upgraded in real time with software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history has been marked by the speed of surprises and successes in this elegant universe.
At first no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep climb during the past few seasons, in the final race last November everyone was betting on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without wanting to undermine the skills of German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into its hands, thus creating a winning team, has become legendary.
In fact, it is a high-performance process simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for non-car racing purposes.
This computer program, called PLM, has been used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce or simulate a product or process faithfully before it is actually built, to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that using this software in the Red Bull Formula 1 factory can design and implement the changes and improvements that are detected in racing and testing "in a few hours, almost in real time".
Russwurm points out that in 1992 there were on average ten technicians working in the racetracks, who could make no more than three or four improvements in a season.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 highly skilled young people, using powerful computers to perform analysis and make all kinds of changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was capable of analysing and improving all components of Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault claims sole responsibility.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the simulator's virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula One team can spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory to develop and manufacture its racing cars in a village 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially by journalists, are severely restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula One hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
The enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer uses to help its competitors are the backdrop of other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is zero.
The head of technology at the plant, Steve Nevey, emphasizes that five years ago, it could be said that the progress in race car R&D contributed 50 percent to the victory and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, the shares have changed, and technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers because they are "not predictable gladiators".
HP will open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a network of 20 stores, each of which covers 80 to 100 square metres, which Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the 16 existing multi-brand sales points, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted shop on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 in Spain.
The first of these was inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia).
Herrera didn't want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but he didn't rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Vice-President, who is also Head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening a shop is always the same.
The North American group of companies advises these and takes over the exclusive store facilities (with interactive products to touch).
HP is also responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of sales points was intended to "optimize customer service and advice to small and medium-sized enterprises when shopping and after, even packaging".
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service connects to the technical headquarters in Maastricht, Netherlands.
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, sometimes taking up to two days".
"This system has been developed specifically for small and mediumsized enterprises and private customers, because the large enterprises already have their technical customer service service service contracts", explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from his rival in three years
Banco Sabadell's chief executive, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, believing that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but first rejecting a new liquidity crisis and predicting the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a drop in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset by raising fees and borrowing prices.
Sabadell expects to have a million private customers in three years, a field that still needs to be explored.
Sabadell has found a way to make the most of the next three years, and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without the public assistance of the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if the customers that the bank will lose are deducted - which is the great challenge this bank faces, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has reached 250 000 private customers and 50 000 enterprises.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while their business customers account for more than 10 percent.
The Bank will also be able to provide a financial report on the challenges facing the Bank in the period 2011-2013.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has disrupted all the banks' plans.
Sabadell will complete its Optima Guidance Plan, which was originally set for three years, this year, but was extended for one financial year due to market conditions.
The customers who leave the savings banks are the bank's main target.
At a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a great reach".
The manager thinks Spain will only come out of the crisis "slowly".
It would also be "very difficult" to "create jobs" in two or three years - essential for the survival of banks.
Even if the war on liabilities - which punishes interest rates - is expected to subside, the risk premium banks and savings banks have to pay for their issues to maintain liquidity will already be counterbalanced by the price of loans for falling profit margins.
"Liquidity and financing are structural issues and will put pressure on loans".
"We haven't turned the corner, but the interest rate differentials are very high", Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of longterm loans and to increase the interest rate differential (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy of 'increasing fees' but 'within a competitive framework'.
The Group's strategic plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the Group does not exclude corporate business.
He assures us that in Spain "larger enterprises are necessary".
"Everything will change in the coming year", he assures us.
It stresses that the demand for capital is currently 'increasing dramatically' and does not exclude the possibility that some Spanish financial institutions will fall to red.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in case of capital increases.
After assuring Sabadell that he could survive a temporary market closure, he defers the argument of some bankers who already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be done, but unlike the incidents in June, it was possible to obtain short-term financing through repurchase transactions and thus to stem the crisis.
CECA excludes a second merger of savings banks
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the marketing of certain products is therefore not intended to be interpreted as meaning that the measures taken by the Member States are not in conformity with the requirements of the directive.
When the Spanish savings banks started the process of concentration, several savings banks insisted on not participating in the first stage.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings and Loan Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed.The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but rather as adjustments".
"The majority of the work is complete. We may have 13 or 14 instead of 17, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has been very supportive of all the processes".
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process had been completed 'as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process set in the past, not now, in the business plans with Banco de España', he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million in assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process.
Olavarrieta explained that "there were a number of unbroken opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed the absurdity and absurdity" because "Banco de España urges us to complete the process on time before the end of the year".
The Commission's Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world, adding that those who doubted this would do so "without any deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation we "have no need to worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very important" concentration process to be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has opted to retain the euro but has also set conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero proposed new adjustment measures, from tax reductions for small and mediumsized enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers or the abolition of the EUR 426 unemployment benefit, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the one responsible for the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is a matter of course not to be mistaken for Merkel's public relations position.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which is in conflict with the preservation of the old traditions of most of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, speculation is beginning in Germany about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second is the reintroduction of the German mark, although it sounds more like science fiction at the moment, supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is the conversion of the euro into a single currency, in accordance with German proposals, which means: greater macroeconomic control, stricter budgetary management, the punishment of countries that break the rules, possibly the suspension of payments by some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been declining for some time.
The Commission has been working on a number of initiatives to address the current situation in the EU, including the creation of a new European Union framework for the financing of the financial crisis.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to rescue Greece.
At the time, this was heavily criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has come out with a clear position again, calling for a reform of the European Union agreements to enable a country to be rescued while obliging private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has been the driving force behind the Irish crisis and all that followed.
But their proposal, although somewhat sweet, was accepted.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that even if unpopular measures are needed now, the euro will no longer function as it did before.
The Commission has therefore considered that the Commission should be able to take into account the fact that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
Germany is showing us that we must follow a hard growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and buildings with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be taken into account.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be doing badly if we didn't understand.
It's not just about reducing the government deficit to 3 percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is fool ourselves.
I hope the current turbulence will pass in more calm.
And that we will be using the opportunities that are being offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in the house has already made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything will change.
The possibility is that we should leave the euro area, which is full of low-level countries, without excluding it.
In that case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sports and leisure
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos's in the Ajax game show inventiveness, but not the will to evade a penalty.
The allegedly exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 game against Ajax in the Champions League led to much speculation as to whether or not it was an unsportsmanlike act and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is common knowledge, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee would show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead their group, the two players will meet the sanction imposed on them in the next league match against Auxerre and thus enter the next stage without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under these or similar circumstances is not a new practice; it is more common in the world of football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos -- the unwritten rules that are followed in this sport.
Part of the debate surrounding the case is that a team from Real Madrid (who in their anthem praises virtue and honor and on other occasions punished their players for similar incidents) played the lead role, and that Mourinho dramatized the story by adding an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are an infraction of the rules.
In this respect, the damage to the spirit of sport should be investigated.
The spirit of sports is defending the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the opposing players taking unjustified advantage of the opposing team.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by a foul game or circumvention of the rules, because circumvention of the rule was usually not done in secret to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and happily accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders derived from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasised here that the rival was neither put at a disadvantage nor benefited from the game played, as the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It's also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club doesn't have those players.
The advantage is obviously that players can start the next Champions League game phase without playing cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, to some extent uncertain, because the team could eventually withdraw, and the players with this procedure also receive a penalty and move on to the second card cycle, where they withdraw less than in the first cycle because of card accumulation.
It is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
In the end, such practices are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which includes strategic decisions to make the most of the rules.
In this case, players did not want to avoid a penalty (which would in fact be a clear case of rule violation), they preferred to choose when to comply with it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or escaping punishment.
Although the boundary between invention and rule of law is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the controversy arose from two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the kind of rule transfer provoked.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the protection of the environment.
The dictatorship of the calendar has caused an avalanche of reservations to fall on 16 and 17 December this year.
The celebrations paid for by employees themselves are spreading. They don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas period that supply Barcelona's restaurant and leisure industry with oxygen, but as a result of the economic crisis they launch a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which is the large crowd: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on a lunch or dinner, the entrepreneurs and associations surveyed confirm.
To make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of 13 December, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two top floors (16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when bad times began, many companies have cancelled group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To avoid having to abandon this tradition, many workers pay out of their own pocket.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new directive on the protection of the environment.
The representative of the umbrella association has not yet dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think a hundred times before they make a reservation".
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to prices", he stresses.
Business will be successful for those who "offer quality at good prices with good service", he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices of 25 euros are the most in demand.
A survey of various central restaurants found that the evening of December 17 led to the collapse of the vendors.
The Soteras Group says demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros will boom, and the group has adapted its menus with full offers of between 25 and 35 euros to the current economic situation.
Another leading group, Andilana, which operates 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led to the peculiarity of the calendar to make advance reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros", he explains.
AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, is optimistic as revenues have been booming and the outlook for Christmas business has been positive, albeit for a few days, since the second quarter.
Sources in the group say that the 18th will also be a busy day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
The six group menus have been added to a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more as a price tag, giving the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
In some companies, too, green shoots are seen, which is why employees are invited back, giving the impression that group dinners are on the rise again.
On the other hand, the Fecasarm umbrella association (with associations such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association) is confident that the vice-president, Enric Gomà, will see the end of the tunnel and notes that the overall bookings are quite 'vivid', although customers 'hit a high.'
But the fun of the celebration didn't go down, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a major concern in the United States
Islamabad is building nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
WikiLeaks' revelations confirm the relationship between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concerns that Washington is facing about Pakistan's nuclear program.
On the margins of the clear and juicy details that the documents provide on the content of the talks and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being strengthened but is "decreasing" on the contrary, and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored in individual pieces to make it harder to destroy them in the event of a possible attack - is making Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of former National Security Council head James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area under attack by the Taliban, the probable dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of transportation of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in nuclear weapons and missile programmes is no longer considered by the United States alone but also by Russia as a source of distraction and reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan needs to hire strictly religious personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs", Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is waning and the increased pace at which Pakistan is making nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" said: "There is often no transparency; we don't get answers to offers or they are rejected".
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, an official with the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country".
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the commander-in-chief of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" to the official that "the Pakistani army must cease its silent support of terrorist groups".
On the hunt for the WikiLeaks boss
Obama has appointed a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further revelations.
Interpol has issued a red alert to prosecute and locate Assange.
Everything that is connected to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze in which the facts are difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" on Assange's "discovery and prosecution".
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new. It's from November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The lawyer for WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens also assures us that "the police knew where and how to contact Mr Assange".
On 20 May, the international police authority based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not made public until yesterday after receiving the authority from the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are tasked with identifying and tracking Assange "to arrest and extradite him".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the organisation, consider the red alert to be a release letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is presumed to be staying.
The move angered Assange's lawyers, who gestured to publish a letter informing him that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and was granted permission by the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"It's like a hunt, not a legal pursuit", the letter accuses.
While the world is looking for him - and his Australian mother is claiming her son's innocence - Assange is in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he interviewed Time magazine's editor via Skype from an undisclosed location, asking for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN, violating international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign", he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation motion "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should take the opinion of a guy with a website seriously", he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent new document leaks.
President Barack Obama's attempt to draw less attention to Assange is contrary to the views that conservative politicians and commentators are promoting these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports or contributes to them".
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, went even further and had to withdraw his statement that Assange must be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target disk and use an unmanned aircraft or something".
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever leaked information into the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is a too mild punishment", he told Fox.
Puigcercós looks with a twinkle at the Carod for peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret ballot to keep him in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the assembly principle.
It seems that Joan Puigcercós has found a recipe for the tenth time to avoid internal unrest in the ERC after losing 11 MEPs and half the votes.
The party chairman is aware that his threat to resign is not enough for the immediate family of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weak today as its mentor himself and will not give him the same head-breaking as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is winning the new critics with a twinkle in the eye, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the start, it was announced yesterday that the more than 200 regional councillors of ERC could comment on his stay in office in secret.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to pass a penalty to the president, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division and submission among himself.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half the votes plus one, and he added without giving a percentage, that a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod family demands more from the president than just the party to provide his office, an inadequate gesture since Puigcercós controls the highest organ of the Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board on a plan of action from now until May.
They hope to be able to contribute to the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation, which the management will submit to the Council for a vote on 18.
Their intention is to bail out for Puigcercós, who in return will promise to present the Congress in the fall of 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.
The ERC's party chairman believes that polyphony is damaging stability and is striving to make the organisation clean its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting consul Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the Innovació owner considered it a fact that the party chairman is supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, which means the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second one could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the principle of full assembly as a functioning principle.
He is therefore calling for a reform of the statutes to allow elected delegates to hold the congresses.
The end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is obsessed with Puigcercós' team, which has already fought for it in the last two congresses.
In fact, at the 2008 Constituent Assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the General Assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
The Commission has not yet decided on the date on which the Commission will take action.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
23 murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, four cases were recorded in Mexico less than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to the MILENIO México census.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, we have a total of 390 deaths, which are believed to be related to organized crime.
Among the cases is Cuexcontitlán, a town in Toluca, San Diego.
The subject had at least three gunshot shots, the grenade was fired at his head, and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas Street in the Santa Cruz Acatlán settlement of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, early in the morning, farm workers found a body with torture traces and at least three deadly shots in the chest basket on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway on the section that runs through the village of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was found a message, presumably signed by the Crimean organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was killed with eight shots after leaving his home to do his job as a garbage collector.
On November 7, two 30-year-old people died from gunshot wounds to the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with a gunshot wound to the forehead was found on a deserted road in the village of El Naranjo and under the body a cartridge case fired with a caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewage of the Playa Golondrina settlement.
The ER was looking for the rest of the body but couldn't find her.
Residents of Tepotzotlán were informed of the discovery of a body they had discovered near Peña Colorada, with their hands tied behind them and their head tied together.
The man had a wound in his neck from a gunshot wound.
In the middle of the month, two men were reportedly murdered, wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two covered dead women were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the body of a man, probably named Mario Ríos, was found wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, according to the message left by his murderers next to him.
In the San Francisco settlement of Ixtapaluca, the body of a woman was found dead with gunshot wounds to the neck.
The woman's skin was marked with Santa Muerte tattoos and chains with corresponding images.
Last month, in the municipality of Zinacantepec, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads covered in tape and a message were discovered in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
A message, presumably signed by a criminal organization, was placed across the body, saying, "This happens to those who do not participate".
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with torture marks were found inside a taxi parked behind the San Agustín Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and chained in black plastic bags, with a message attached, the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the settlement of Juárez.
Next to him, the police found a box with a message.
China keeps its targets for reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of China at COP16 said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and would maintain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is holding its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16, assured.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to transform its industry.
He said that in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He said, however, that China would not change its objectives but would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that China's climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes targets for reducing emissions, he said.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China, the federal authorities had worked with the central government and the local authorities to achieve the energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction targets.
It also noted that several multiannual plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those financed by other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been in place for the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private sources.
He also said that a provincial project on climate change is underway, another one on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and another one on mitigation and adaptation.
Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is generally believed.
He pointed out that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States, they are 100 tons.
He also said that the country is making unprecedented progress in energy use, with energy efficiency increasing by 20% over the past five years and expected to increase further by 2020.
Legal exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party chairman had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the law would grant him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was justified and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the law would grant him.
In an interview given before the appeal Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the State, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Sonora Commission of the Law".
'Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case, for a decision to be taken by a competent authority,' he added.
On the other hand, he said it was not the time to think about 2012 and that an alliance of presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, when his successor will be elected, would strengthen the Acción Nacional.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not scared of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly select the best president or the best president needed by the National Action for the next three years, so he would hand over the staff "to the one the Council would appoint".
"I'm quite unconcerned and open-minded, and I'd be proud to hand over the office of party chairman to each of the five".
He predicted that the party's upsurge in the last election on July 4 will be reflected in the next election, although "it's not the time to think about 2012".
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his mission".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be watched throughout the country, so "many hopes and aspirations are placed in them and I am sure Gabino is on the level of the demands".
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse during his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally get out of the closet", he reiterated.
He believes that the holder of the federal government could make expressions like those he would make in his speech in the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no ban on speech in this country, let alone censorship.
Obama is on Twitter advocating for the law in favor of undocumented students
"If you're for the Dream Act, call your senators and push for it", the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - the law to legalize undocumented students - with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you're for the Dream Act, call your senators and push for this bill", Obama tweeted.
His brief message includes a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document urging the public to contact their senators in a subtle way as the vote on the bill is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you", he stresses.
The news spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any legislation, unless the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were expanded.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could have an impact on the passage of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratifying the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the remaining projects could be set.
"I think we have plenty of time left...
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year"...
"I think we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would "ask for a vote to close the debate" to pass the Dream Act, which would allow the Senate to pass the bill to legalize undocumented students starting next Thursday, although it would be more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were under the age of 16, lived in that country for the past five years and enrolled in a higher education institution or the military.
But the bill's proponents need 60 votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans.
The Democrats, who have a majority in favor of the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
That's why the Dream Act's advocates need to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans in the House are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the term of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who has spoken out for the bill, John McCain, has not yet set his stance.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is the biggest obstacle.
Put your fingers in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust for Language' was a walk where participants made a strong effort to tell the story
"I understand the sex in language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, she explained, the round table was dedicated to sex in language).
The finger in the wound... "put us in trouble", the Argentine writer spat sweetly at the audience, which was made up mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and Shultz described it as a great story afterwards. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get an answer, but clues to the guide to her story.
She leaves the infectious disease specialist convinced, "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound".
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the trauma specialist who took her breath away in the middle of the walk, but who explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "The wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The main character of the story sighs, relieved, and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it was really open and did not exist".
Valenzuela, the writer, played with them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful account, which he called the "Lob of the Invention", in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous witch who touched the clouds, brought back men who had travelled far, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The tale made a turn and told of America, the great novel that was not lacking from the beginning in its own chronicles, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with an imagination that even the sense of shame was lost".
However, he emphasizes that "the crazy and the liar are the ones who imagine things best", and that is where reality and lies come closer together, where you no longer know which side the story belongs to, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
He actually calls it the "Cervantes tradition".
"We inherited from him the story of being told".
When Mayra Montero was in her turn, the author commented and praised the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the FIL to the round table of 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed to.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that is affecting her country - as well as all of Latin America - as a result of the drug trafficking struggles.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unplanned commitment", she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and a bond that builds between the author and the readers as if it were a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also raised "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness also lead to dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial a little yes".
"To possess our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means putting our finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white", he noted, inviting them to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano is fighting for his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he's had ups and downs in his career, but he played three crucial games.
In addition, the final match between Santos Laguna and Monterrey will feature two different styles, which are set by their respective coaches, and their match, marked by opposites, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has had three crucial games, and so far he has been good, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine has been a second champion, one step behind the winners, and surprisingly, he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santista strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 2002 Torneo Apertura, when del Morelia was in charge, with which he suffered a major defeat against Toluca 4-2; later, at the Clausura 2003 he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario, where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a back-to-back as the game went 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes, but in the eleventh meter he came 3-1 ahead and got two chances to clinch his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned out to be a 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finals to the Devils Rojos and one to his rival Monterrey, so he doesn't want to be haunted by bad luck and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he says the game itself is the most important thing to him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, which I'm giving up, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens first is the most important thing", the driver commented when asked about the lost finals.
He remembers the final game very well, and he says he learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we're ready to go, the players are ready to go, because the last time we were ready to go, we were already two feet ahead, and I think that's a lesson, until the game is over, there's no reason to celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be decided by a quarterfinal doesn't worry him because he trusts his players: "You never want to get to the quarterfinal, you want to finish in regular time, but sometimes there's no alternative and you have to be prepared for that, we were prepared in the previous tournament, but unfortunately fate prepared us for a bad game, sometimes because of nervousness or the intense effort to keep the title in our hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope it won't happen this time".
It's in Romanso's power to not just be second champion and to taste the fame that the titles bring for the first time.
The United States is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves to the visa application service before their interview at the consulate, thus reducing the costs of waiting times.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must introduce themselves to the visa application service (ASC) before they are interviewed at the consulate.
The ASC staff shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be reduced as the deadline, processing of the visa application and the transport service that hands out the document will no longer be required to be paid separately.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including temporary visa for employees) and $390 for handlers and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas do not have to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and be fingerprinted.
As biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment to the consulate will stay there less than before.
Those applying for visas at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service fee.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found at http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency has convened a press conference to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for life in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, a science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a surprising find for the search for extraterrestrial life", prompting speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments previously considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures could exist, and the hypothesis was raised that they could transform into intelligent beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, and it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for all life forms because the lake is highly arsenic-rich.
In some ways, the microbiome uses arsenic as a survival resource, and given this ability, the chances are higher that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, astrobiologists say, it has been shown that "there is actually another life form, a second life form, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the actual scope of its fund at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon) under the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to Earth's.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The reform of the Congressional Organ Act will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislative session had just begun and an opposition bloc had already been set up, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who had declared himself independent.
Before the start of the 60th legislative session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a "two-party system" would be introduced, because now there would be two persons, the same number as the parties, controlling the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, Coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-Chair.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political margins with these reforms.
He said that they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI in the coming days to change the scheme, assuming that they had the political will and that if they did not, they would be re-oppressed by both parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"I am going to come this far (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there were consensus with PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the legislative reform that a two-party system should reign forever in Congress".
"For the start, this group starts with five Members and they are talking to more colleagues to make them more", the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, in reference to PAN and PRI, stated that the Congress has now become a 'booty' for two.
"It used to be just one party, now they're dividing it in two".
Mr Montalvo asked the Members to be respected and to be given their place at the negotiating table.
"The five, who are currently seen as divided into different factions, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table because of the reform that was carried out and agreed upon by the others, and we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform".
200 000 pesos more for the supplier
The municipality of Mazatlán pays another check to the disputed owner of the company for electrical equipment.
Another cheque of just over 200 000 pesos for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
The amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year is thus 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the City Administration's page for greater transparency, this check, numbered 9258447, was issued on 16 November for the purpose of "accounting for open invoices" and amounted to Peso 200.144.56.
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go to this supplier from the municipality, which is being watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at exorbitant prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and, as a result, the number of checks still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debt is being paid, just like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last checks 'reappeared' in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal as required by law, when a company is challenged by ASE to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be re-used.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on 25 July the examination of the checks issued by the municipality to its suppliers, it was announced that the municipality had previously paid Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos with 42 checks, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she received checks worth over 3 million pesos.
The tourist areas need to be improved urgently
Tourism companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the Glorieta Sanchez Taboada break-in, the Mazatlán tourism industry requested special attention from the authorities to areas in poor condition that give a bad impression of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Merchants' Association, recalled that on different occasions, the tourist destination was asked to maintain its location and to turn the poor conditions that tourists face into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had a negative impact as tourists came for a stroll and saw the mess, which would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to have to shut down a company one day, and they don't care how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction work this slowly and unplanned".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall had brought to the attention of the city the lack of prevention and maintenance work.
"The community must take responsibility and prevent this from happening again. How should they do this? Well, through preventive maintenance rather than improving everything in retrospect", he explained.
"We are eagerly awaiting a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, but because we have a right to clean living space, the city must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition".
"There are other places that also look unattended and unfinished", he said, "for example, El Escudo y el Venadito de Mazatlán".
"Today, more than advertising is needed to attract tourists, but a good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and tourist attractions in constant focus", he added.
"These arrangements have not received sufficient attention and these types of incidents only show what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed".
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, stressed the importance of saving Mazatlán's tourist sites, as they were not being used properly and created a bad image.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take the necessary measures to ensure that the city is clean, orderly and attractive for tourism.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned up and cleaned up first to make them attractive to tourists and to add to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP is demanding results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that the Members should take the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business sector in Mazatlán is demanding a decent parliament, free of negotiations between parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and facing great problems.
The 60th Parliament was inaugurated yesterday and consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergencia and one from the PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanism and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right to act free from party-to-party agreements, because it is common for them to make agreements that represent their own interests, which turn them into carnival parades for the leaders of the parliamentary factions".
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We're making sure they do a credible job and are committed to society and its groups above all else, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last election".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people was to drive and work together for the economic growth of the country, because the economic situation is extremely complicated today.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures that will in some way promote job creation".
In the light of the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the necessary priority to the tourism ministry in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I understand that the Ministry is the second-least-resourced, and that is incompatible with a major economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agribusiness".
The tourism projects must be funded, the state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been re-written in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
A Holy King is Seeking
Puppetry, cars, bicycles and other toys are something the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Triennial, for the household is composed of no more than twelve persons and no less than one goat.
Yet, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar, and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement, where they live hand in hand because the father has no fixed job.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and I'm going to the street with the goers to sell them in the afternoon", said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting a 'monster car' for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests one-year-old-size clothes.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would love this monster so much,' but I replied, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive", Cayetana sadly remembered.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is 12 in height; the ten-year-old Isaías is 10 in height; the eight-year-old Miguel is 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes, and a pair of 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the 'Holy King is Wanted' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the Noroeste newspaper's lobby.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie were carried out in the context of the smashing of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, places which are said to have been used primarily for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used in the production have been seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Police.
A total of 11 men and three women have been arrested, including two of the men who are believed to be the main drivers of the drug ring from Sherbrooke.
The suspects appear outside the courthouse in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be charged with, inter alia, the production of cannabis, the sale of cannabis, conspiracy and the supply of criminal services.
These house searches were the result of a lengthy investigation that lasted over a year.
'The information obtained from the public has enabled us to make these arrests,' Mr Ruel explained.
About 70 police officers from the Estrian Regional Investigation Unit, the Quebec Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
The secret migration could be easily tracked
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says will address the problem of ships loaded with secret migrants, is expected to be stamped after the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they could not support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter".
"I stand with a party that has put chains to your feet", Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff told the assembly after the weekly caucus.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows anyone who comes from a seagoing ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the proposed Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it was targeting the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for the government to act", Mr Duceppe explained.
The criticism of the immigration question by Olivia Chow, NDP, has turned a blind eye to critics who claim her party has not been steadfast enough towards the secret migrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree that measures should be taken against the blind passengers, and that is what we are trying to enforce through another bill, C-35", Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservatives' bill because it blames the refugees and keeps children in captivity for at least a year", Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling the House that they do not tolerate this kind of covert immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that treat the country like a foot-retired person".
"They expect Canada to take tough action", Minister Kenney said.
"The government has not announced any confidence vote on its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a Conservative told QMI that the government would call for a vote to have any opposition MP immediately present to his constituents.
The new unity will not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest that a new, existing anti-corruption and collusion unit could be set up, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public committee of inquiry into the matter.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Safety, claims that this idea is not yesterday's: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue in January.
The metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Nevertheless, Wednesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at all at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, described the announcement as "a hat-trick of rabbits" and "a well-crafted solution at a table".
Minister Dutil had, in turn, addressed those who feared that political power had too much influence over the future unit in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it", he said.
"You're aware of this problem".
According to Réjean Parent, the CSQ President, nothing can replace a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide", he explained.
"The only way to form an inquiry committee is to resign Jean Charest", explained Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and policy systems at ENA (the National Academy for the Training of Senior Executives).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he suggests that the Quebec financial audit authority be given a special mandate to conduct appropriate investigations into corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control", he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec Audit Office could grant the same powers as the Commissioners, which would also allow it to compel the public to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
The Quebec government will also demand that Ottawa amend the penal code to better deal with these types of crimes.
This request comes from the Prosecutor General of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain updates on this dossier.
During Operation Spring 2001, which involved motorcycle police groups, 131 people were arrested despite the fact that the penal code had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa passed the gangster law.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several streams remain under strict control due to heavy rainfall in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has sunk into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 milliliters fell on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimetres of rainfall were expected here by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
In total, up to 100 millimeters of rainfall had fallen here.
Since the snow melting which has already accumulated in certain subregions is to be added to these precipitation, the crossing of several waterways is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec security service issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The floodwaters in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière are being monitored here and continue to be monitored.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge was torn down due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Security Advisor Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec State Dry Water Centre issued warnings on Wednesday of a sharp rise in several rivers, particularly the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly corrected
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered some setbacks before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial comments about welfare and Haitians as well as his poor radio speech.
The CCNR considers that while Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their views, certain statements 'have contained inadequate information on social security and unwarranted negative statements by Haitians, as well as unspoken language which is not appropriate for broadcasts broadcast during the day.'
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violated the Broadcasting Code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was lodged on the basis of a complaint lodged by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators should provide more solid than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
'The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the impact of the 'Dupont le midi' programme in question would have been more family friendly and appropriate to address a sensitive issue.'
Therefore, he was not charged with any offense against himself.
The last point of contention was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media-friendly debate on this issue that generated a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he had not donated to Haiti's aid, since it was not known for sure whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Board considers that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension in this case".
"My case has been virgin for a year and a half", explained the moderator.
In all its decisions, the Supervisory Board condemns the spread of uncouth expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted 'beyond its obligations'.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was to communicate its decisions only once during prime time within a three-day period, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a Montreal native of Algeria, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (Full Contact Kung Fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now climbing into the world's boxing rings in search of new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek combat everywhere, for those who do not like the way mixed martial arts portray ground fighting, North American competition is rare".
Recently, the security officer and UPS employee of his character gave bad news to his rival, winning two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, from October 23 to 30.
"I won the full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China".
"Those fighters from each category who had placed among the top four at the last World Cup were invited".
"I got babe bronze in Toronto in 2009".
"I became a Vietnamese in 2005".
"In 2007, I finished fifth in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto", he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition".
"With this rhythm, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San Shou or Sanda is a Chinese discipline that allows fists and footsteps as well as throwing.
The two-legged match is usually played on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most famous boxer to emerge from this kind of martial art is the American Vietnamese Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal were to withhold only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most prestigious in China", explained the sympathetic pound-for-pound dog.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium".
"It was a super experience".
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro", he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will meet each other in the final of their respective categories".
"Then the winners of each category will offer their faces to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu".
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to award contracts of $450 million to project planning companies for the Eastmain-1A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium comprising BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor has received the most important share, namely the project management, for a total of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector, to hand over responsibility for this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Gerence consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia represents a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of distortion of competition and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a card game and it weakens the competition".
"This means that instead of playing games in secret, they are now being played in open form", PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a press conference yesterday.
The question was raised by Mr Simard in the National Assembly early this morning, because he found it difficult to understand how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the Treaty.
"I will remain true to my line", she insisted, adding that the PQ was "unfair" and "lacked hardness".
She said it was "the least" that PQ apologized.
The consortium model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scale of work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competitive battle; negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir reported last week, the consortium's model used in civil engineering and consultancy is the subject of government investigations.
A short overview of the Quebec Business Register allows more than 200 consortia to be named, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way Dessau, for example, cooperates with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Commission.
As regards the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that 'the Bay James area is subject to a particular labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has taken this fact into account in a particular way since the 1970s'.
Réal Laporte, the main employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement which has been very disappointing in the agreement on the project management contract.
"If you bid and there are few applicants, your prices will rise".
"So you have two options: either you take the people on this Mart and tell yourself, 'We'll negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price.'"
"The idea is, however, that it is not the price that matters, but the expertise of the people", Laporte stressed.
This contract, awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium, is part of a long list of contracts totalling more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet concluded any formal investigation into the existence of a market economy investor in the Union.
SNC-Lavalin had secured 22 contracts, Génivar 16 contracts, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 contracts, without taking into account their participation in Energy Gerance.
All these contracts have been negotiated.
The total amount of these contracts is $449,783,344, including the contract with Energy Gerance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the Parti libéral du Québec.
Minister Normandeau had indicated that PQ was equally linked to the companies that 'financed' it, before clarifying that it was their executives.
Barometers of responsible consumption - The 'green' label is not a confidence-building label
Green, but uninjured skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little confidence in the brands or ecolabels that are intended to guide his choice.
It is a pity that it is bathing in a media-driven world where information is flooded with the benefit of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption is complaining about a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that is a brake on its commitment, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Although they have promoted the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to be offering little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebecers admit to having no faith in the environmental commitment of companies as much as they do in green business advertising, according to the instrument developed by the Centre de Consommation de l'Université de Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers question the credibility of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the Barometer.
The same pattern is followed by the political discourse on this subject which is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Information on responsible consumption seems nevertheless important to stimulate this segment of consumption, which currently accounts for almost one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and doubtful nature of the information dampened the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Moreover, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the performance of the green products and services that are being offered.
According to another communication, in 2010 more than half of consumers had already changed their habits and, mainly, changed the brand of one or more products to express their beliefs.
According to the barometer, they also favored 61% of purchases from local merchants and favored the purchase of food grown in their area.
Greener and more responsible - the environmental conscious consumption index had reached a 64 of the 100 maximum this year - Homo consumus du Québec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its environmental footprint by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness still seems to be holding up in front of his car, according to the barometer: barely 28% of Quebecers said they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the transportation hubs to demonstrate their environmental interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds on clichés.
State aid for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and the company Parallèle, which had hoped for a grant of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, to return it to its original cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they demanded.
The government has agreed to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond lower than originally expected, which could lead to a viable solution on favourable terms, at least according to sources available to the government.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million were rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request has been revised downwards since then.
A proposal and an action plan have already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had her filed a final report.
The Council's counterproposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to answer these questions.
In any case, the premise of public contribution seems to have been really pushed aside.
Recall that the Quebec ownership association of cinemas and movie theatres opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there which he had not allowed to be given to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic aid.
The director of cinema, Daniel Langlois, had been presenting the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over a decade after the cinema was self-financed, with great difficulty, which could justify the exception from the State budget.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clients on the line.
The company Angus and the company Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are in turn running a privately funded campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of Xavier Beauvois' highly successful film Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini has not called off the newspaper Le Devoir and you ignore what he and his group think of the downward-correcting proposals that have been made to them.
The Secret of the Complex Shaken Canada
The new American diplomatic guidance released by WikiLeaks exposes the secret of what the United Nations believes under the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but with the same blow, it exposes the superiority of the latter to Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters are not thinking about Canadian-American relations in the election process, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer even more sparkling details than the mere substantive content you have to gnaw at.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, shows the point at which the United Nations ceased to participate in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"A complex of inferiority that is almost inherent in Canadians may make Canadian political leaders much more inclined to talk about everyday issues than to push the United States to black Peter in this election (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign) ", he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of choice: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of".
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, given the intense political and economic relations between the two countries.
'Logically,' he assesses, 'it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to conduct such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the voting process.'
Another expression of this sense of importance is found in a statement sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a business owner in Ottawa, which President Barack Obama is preparing for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's continued support in the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, which was created by a $30 billion to $40 billion stimulus program", Breese explains.
He had never mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the coalition from overthrowing parliament and that the opposition parties' continued existence would affect the quality of the proposed stimulus programme.
Another January 2008 news release, written by Ambassador Wilkins, tells Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series aired on CBC from the United States is spreading.
The ambassador is concerned about shows like Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where you can watch little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or even diversions for the purpose of CIA muscle-protested interrogations.
Another communication details how Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual 'case by case' decision.
At the end of the meeting, it was described that "he handed the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim".
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file again".
Finally, let us note that the feelings about the WikiLeaks website are heating up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close-knit adviser to Stephen Harper, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for renewal of lighting
The UN yesterday proposed in Cancun a plan to renew lighting for households, trade and industry in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, equivalent to almost a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
The main problem, which is that 1.8 billion tonnes of CFCs are being released to the earth from lighting, would be avoided if the white-hot pears, which have a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market so far, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the world's fleet of exhaust gases.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions from 53 to 49 Gt.
However, we would have to deduct another 5 Gt from this balance sheet to stabilize climate change by 2 degrees Celsius between now and 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-hot pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces light.
The compact bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, and the new LED bulbs reduce energy consumption by a further twofold.
The compact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched this week by Philips - which was part of the UN study, by the way - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white-lighted bulb, giving an indication of the savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs give off very little heat, they can also operate with a regulatory resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless producers provide a reception centre.
The report notes, however, that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulbs, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity used by the glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants produce 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the gains each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 coal plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast is excited to announce the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election to be published "immediately" as soon as they are due to expire.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay", a UN chief spokesman said.
'It calls on all parties and institutions in Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.'
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the election commission had delayed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
Some 40 minutes before the start of the programme, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue its work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls were made from all over the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round of the elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the Constitutional Council to cancel "fraudulent" voting rights in the north, which were achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, confirmed that the FN's manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the president from running.
The whole election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council takes into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo contractors are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politician closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former rebels, has called the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to call for victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and it is illegal to file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election commission was prevented from publishing the results.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was held to crown the process of unification and reconciliation of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held accountable for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of the election on 31 October with 38% of the vote, compared with 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% (including overseas departments) according to the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, according to preliminary seasonal data published by the Federal Statistical Office Insee on Thursday.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% for overseas departments.
The unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points over the year.
More generally, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were unemployed in the third quarter but were looking for work, including whether they were employable every two weeks or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market continued to deteriorate, with the unemployment rate in the metropolis increasing by 24.2% (+0.9 percentage points over three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the 15-24 year olds were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of those over 50 years of age, including 6.6% of overseas departments.
Only those aged 25-49 benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After a debate on its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office has not published monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues to use this method, announcing on Tuesday a 9.8% share in France for October (including overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Accused and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), was investigated and was taken to the prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public and fraudulent markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of company assets, misappropriation of public goods, bribery, complicity in corruption, illegal bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and will comment on any questions the prosecution may ask him instead of spreading brainstorming".
"It's easy to make him a criminal case, but it's another thing to prove it", his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had insisted that the judge be given a memorandum of justification before his hearing by his lawyers.
A Guérinis member, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and jailed on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but keep his landfill running.
He never knew the scope of business competence or the target location of the associated funds, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne Municipal Public Service, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but then again released under the order to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts alleged against him".
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom", said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released from custody on Tuesday night, including two under judicial supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the disposal company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for 'unauthorised influence and passive bribery'.
Two civil servants from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the grounds of 'Defraction and misappropriation of public property by a public servant' and the other on the grounds of 'accusation of misappropriation of public funds'.
Alexandre Guérini's wife, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "bribery and embezzlement of social property".
Among those confronted by Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar public fraud case involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company of helping to launder money from "high" crime circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the field of winding-up, will be carried out in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigative proceedings.
According to the Commission, the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the area of the airport.
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysee Palace is exaggerating its role as an intermediary for Syria
Within six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", kept the French public in the air, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eye of the United States diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by Le Monde newspaper give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not serve the liberation of Majid Kakavand, a French prisoner wanted by American justice for trafficking in material for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they highlight the way in which the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media in order to make it credible that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he had done nothing in that regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled 'Iran: French comments on the way hostages are handled'.
François Richier, Elysée's strategic adviser, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
They urge Americans to do everything they can to bring back their own nationals who were being held in Iran.
"Make noise", they said, "articulate loud and clear and without interruption" the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this even more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do that".
Because "silence does not solve anything", past the attempts to discuss in a subtle way that the Iranians are "masters of evasion maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "conventional Iranian tactic": "hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss' release from prison (which was to take place on 16 August, the day she fled to the French embassy) "calls for the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he makes it sound that Elisee anticipates further hostage taking, a phenomenon that will "grow stronger".
He said the Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future".
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but remains detained in Iran.
One information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being demanded by the United States for illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials with Iran, has been released from prison following a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iranian networks illegally acquiring material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France bought a cow shop ?
The liberation of the Iranian against the Frenchman ?
At a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured him that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision" but also tried to resist.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court decision", he explains.
Mr Richier also points out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under 'strict' supervision by the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser picks up a phone number, re-opens it, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During Clotilde Reiss's detention in Iran, the Elysee did not spare its efforts to make it appear through propaganda and "escape attempts" organized by the media that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediator".
The Americans are not without irony in observing this activity and observing that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 calls for 'the media flash of the French authorities'.
What is the basis for so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy asks.
"Despite their praise-filled statements, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did".
The document then examines the reasons that led the Elysee to the decline of this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria", he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008 that was "perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and unwarranted".
"Building up the role of Syria", Paris is trying to "show Syria what promises can be made by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier confided to her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians did anything".
"But we thanked them for everything".
"This should at least confuse the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is receiving her at the Elysee.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is passing a law called "the ashtray", which will ban youths from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill to call on online gaming operators to ban access to these games from children under 16 after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, representatives from the Ministries of Culture and Family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty learning at school and living a normal life during the day".
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", said Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the draft law for the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be open again from 6 a.m.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to proceed with the application of the law.
The government also intends to ask the manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games for those young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free programmes to those who wish to limit their time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events involving intensive Internet use.
The country is also an unchallenged champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA names the host country
In a heated uproar over suspicions of corruption, FIFA's Executive Committee on Thursday is naming the 2018 and 2022 World Cup host countries, a highly political election that threatens to push the technical criteria in the background of influence ranking and lobbying.
One thing is for sure, however, that the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will be held in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its 2010 African premiere, or to continue its presence in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the figures who are members of the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Head of Government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the extent of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the behind-the-scenes machinery threatens to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's assessment report, the English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documents offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the forefront of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the chances of its own country, the cradle of football, having only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC had again given the floor to the debate on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that shot down three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the British officials who have been lobbying heavily with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The Prime Minister hopes to re-publish the chess draw made by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had organised the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to restore England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking in trophies with its already-finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympics 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the British and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia becoming a major outsider despite its gaps in the record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided to condemn the Committee members' unfair competition in the preparation of the vote for the comments made by the English press.
"You throw dirt at them, you try to compromise them", Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, reinforced by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorite.
First world economic power, home to the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries that co-hosted the 2002 competition.
Another threat: FIFA's long-awaited bid for the 2026 World Cup for China, which will knock out Asian opportunities for 2022.
With Australia and Qatar having pulled all the records with the anticipation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion into new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk because they are certain.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by European countries (due to time delays), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
The second mandate is openness.
De Gaulle was really stunned.
Mitterand had made him think he was a stalker.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than that.
A warrant at the Elysee is calling the next one.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not well-defined on the side of the mystery that holds the presidency together.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, supporters of Jacques Chiracs argued that a third mandate could not be ruled out without believing it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "some time in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would present the prospect of a "two-term" in the Elysee on Tuesday evening to the UMP parliamentarians had thus spread a bit of fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy ?
I'm very short.
The President merely reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone on the occasion of such a meeting.
"You have seven and a half years with me at worst, or at best", he told them in July 2009.
To a news story in May 2010: "Don't believe I'm not thinking about the next phase".
His words the day before today do not make him a candidate any more than the day before; nor do they make him any less.
If they make comments, they should be for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the presidency with the PS on one side.
But it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many PS members are urging to campaign early than expected.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidate from François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to a survey by BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP about it", the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to see defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, who has taken a stand against openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB's central bank last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis or at least to announce the imposition of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The European public debt crisis has forced the central bank in Frankfurt to make up for the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, and it is certainly not in a position to make them worse.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, welcomed yesterday at a press conference the ECB's active role in solving Europe's national debt.
It did not dare to say whether it believed the Central Bank could do more, for example by encouraging its programme of government bond purchases.
'I reserve my views for my European trading partners (...) '.
Mr Trichet, President of the ECB, had not been very vocal about his plans during his hearing in Brussels the day before by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, but had rather been content to point out that the secondary market purchases programme would be 'further developed' and that we would 'see what the decisions look like' at the meeting on Thursday.
The ECB will maintain its key rate at 1% unchanged, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to about EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to some traders, she reportedly made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government bonds yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
The expectation of a continuation of the purchase price is not in any way doubted by traders (see page 29).
The economy no longer expects a noticeable change in prices.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will be able to make use of the unlimited reserves of cash in a free-flow manner over a period of one week to three months.
The economic situation is already changing and the measures are being extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine the ECB changing its programme in any significant way".
"Otherwise, it would risk provoking new tensions in the short term", assumes Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me", says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm going to open the house.
In the area of its intervention in the public debt market, 'the ECB should maintain a volume of bond purchases that will revive the sluggish market,' adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area public debt markets, the ECB has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the marketplace at all costs to the lowest investors and act in such a way as to prevent the early enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest countries", a key bondholder testified yesterday.
If interest rates were to rise, it would make it even more difficult for countries to reduce or even stabilize their debt.
This is the price to pay for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is going undercover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation has relaxed somewhat with the decline in key interest rates to 10 years yesterday.
A return to the deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional presidents, Giulio Tremonti, had described the situation as 'unpredictable' and expected an 'unpredictable' weekend, but the minister immediately denied it.
The German interest rate cutting would have reached its record of 210 basis points on Tuesday and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy would have risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council of Ministers that the Spanish rate gap with Germany was 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed "serious concern" about the "turbulence of the market" and the possible risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, a public economist at the Hudson Institute.
In the light of the above, the problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated taxation which is dizzying and which puts the State at risk of not being able to meet its financial needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts have been a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italy is expected to grow by 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, although the budget presented to the Senate for consideration is expected to grow by 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission estimates that the budget deficit will remain at 4,3% of GDP next year (as opposed to the 3,9% predicted by governments) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
The Commission has therefore also called for a new budgetary group which could be used after the holidays to the tune of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken", says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving the support of international institutions.
"Italy's economy is in good shape and its accounts are in order, as we have been saying for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is the IMF's Italy manager.
"There are no problems at present, either in the short or long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.) is required to make less stabilisation progress than other countries", observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Mr Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies which could lead to a pre-selection by the end of March.
The Commission has therefore decided to adopt a new proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
Europeans are thinking about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde stressed this at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoon and evening that Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area".
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are fully used.
However, there is no way of talking about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, which is probably the most effective target for speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perception, which is particularly bad for banking systems", said BNP Paribas economist Exane.
The Commission has also been able to take a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the development of the internal market.
The European countries, aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 counterparts are progressing well.
This is also true of the Eurogroupe and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan is to get rid of unconventional measures to reinforce the backwardness of the euro area countries at the crossroads of markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Funds, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not to raise funds, he is certainly setting the stage for this.
The first publicity spending from the EU Stability Fund is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative told Reuters that the United States was supporting a possible increase in the fund, which was mobilized by the IMF's additional direct involvement.
Portugal and Spain, the main countries, are committed to structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are complementary to austerity measures are expected to have an impact in the near future.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the marketing of certain products.
Both sides are determined to avoid having to ask for international assistance at all costs before they have set their own budgetary corrections and decided on the necessary structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European investors are discussing the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on a tour of Paris on 24 November, was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-enter its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, in the European public debt market, consider that an extension of EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, preferably in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means that the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion, exists.
An advisory board that has every opportunity to be closely examined in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are worsening.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in alert level Orange
The snowfall still causes traffic difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threatens to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Orange alert level due to the threat of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, and then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the northern Gironde and Charentes rivers, while it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow cover is expected to be 2 to 5 cm, sometimes 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The regions affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic congestion and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads of over 7.5 tonnes have been closed to heavy traffic, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac roads.
The traffic situation on secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to traffic police, who advise against using your own vehicle only in emergency situations, and the use of some TER buses has been suspended throughout the day.
School traffic in Picardy has been suspended for Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no specific restrictive measures were laid down for heavy traffic.
The prefecture "requires drivers to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris' Roissy airport and 10% of their flights from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector in the Ile de France has been in full swing, billions have fallen.
At least in the discussions.
The Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the construction of the new railway.
To help start the construction of the SGP, the State has announced a capital contribution of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is the amount that would then allow the SGP to lend to the markets a part of the financial amount to double it.
Today, finally, we have reached our first high bills.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was reviewed by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
The Commission has also proposed a new tax system to be introduced in the new Member States.
The first, as Article 15 of the draft law states, is 'for the benefit of the Société du Grand Paris, a public law institution'.
The tax is calculated as follows: "The proceeds of this tax amount to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganisation of the existing corporate taxation: 'to modernise it, to increase the resulting product and to respond to this increase in the Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would that bring?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not mentioned in the text.
Of the four billion, you're a long way off.
'It is understood that the tax resources will be added to the €4 billion of capital contribution which will be raised by the State and which will be gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project,' the explanatory statement states.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"From the moment you register your income (the two taxes, i.e. the tax), you can cover the project for three years and then only draw on the 4 billion", it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually withdrawn".
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will be entered in the 2014 budget starting in 2013.
This measure, which will be looking for a long time to come, of the 4 billion promised, is in danger of provoking a fairly moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Avenging Hackers and Scamers
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sinister hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste of a future dominated by regression.
But let's take it one by one.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file created by an intelligence agency (an x-favorite nation) is made up entirely of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what you've been reading for months in every X-popular journal (except those owned by Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has long been a source of substance for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of already known news is essential for the dynamics of intelligence, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library devoted to esoteric publications, you will find that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosary Cruisers) repeats exactly what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (or because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who practice the occult believe only in what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
So is the secret.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers true what he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a crackdown on the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person knows, that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then, when heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have become spy centres, except for some small representative functions.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very well, and it's not hypocritical to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and serves to cast American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an X-Rated hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Moreover, the scandal is less a victim-driven affair than a "slaying of the slain".
But let's focus on the profound nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, you could unite all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been perfectly correct since then, where you could control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel you visited, the highway you chose, and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of the power.
But if you think about what's happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can uncover the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold on when it can no longer keep its own secrets?
It's true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it's also true that any knowledge of Berlusconis or Merkels' character is basically a secret free of secrets, as it reveals the public sphere; but to reveal in the style of WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets is to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this abuse inflicted on such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer post any reserved information online - which would be like a street corner hanging.
But it's also obvious that with the latest technology, it's futile to hope to keep confidential phone records secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has been on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships, which are for certain ears only, be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents secretly moving on uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages with them nowhere but in mere memory, and beyond that, hiding the few written information they've got in the shoebox.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate's espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is advancing like cancer these days, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) videotapes had enabled film researchers to explore a film tape by tape by coiling it backwards and forward and uncovering all the secrets of assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays only allow them to jump from chapter to chapter, in macro proportions.
High-speed trains take three hours from Rome to Milan, while flying takes three and a half hours, including the transition.
It is therefore not uncommon for politics and communication technology to come back to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what kind of secrets were being forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is making good on its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance of the rapidly resolved financing pledges (also called 'fast start' or early financing) implemented by developing countries.
And the French cosmetics are already exposed.
The Copenhagen Treaty pledged developing countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU pulled all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
The operation is remarkable and appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society are happy to see all developed countries doing the same thing at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be 'new and additional' under the Copenhagen Treaty to ensure that additional expenditure is made without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark they consider best.
The EU Commission has chosen, for example, the target for 2009: international funding will be maintained and 150 million will be added over three years under the 'fast start' financing.
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either in terms of year or terms at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France considered that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 was 'new and additional'.
In other words, there are no guidelines for the previous year's expenditure or for public development aid at global level.
In particular, the total French support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to 'new and additional' financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There's no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own computing mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 € borrowed as equivalent to 1 € donated.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission controls based on the most efficient technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro as the equivalent of a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the donor country should be counted as the commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following view: it 'respects' its €420 million commitment by taking in 91.5% of loans (€389.8 million) and donating 8.5% of €36.1 million) - see also the EU document to convince yourself of this.
France is the only EU country that uses loans in large part.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are 100% committed to donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its commitments, France pays just 10 cents and understands a comparable commitment.
That's a good hockey shot.
In general, France operates with a double-edged approach to its fast-start financing: partly with the development of action over time and partly with the reality of financial use.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Treasury Department (as it seems that Bercy was the one who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect: once within the EU (why do the other Member States continue to donate if they can borrow enough?) and then in the negotiations, since developing countries cannot be completely deceived...
The chapter on early financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But it could be too much of a drop in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of balanced equity with the other countries of the European Union.
France could, however, advance the debate on the issue of longterm financing (another crucial and currently debated issue): the question of the 'accountability' or the accounting of its loans is not avoided.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues of dispute as it is on other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement of France's fast start and its vision of 'accountability' and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals per day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (formerly the rights and respect movement for future generations).
The association, which states that its results "do not reflect a statistically significant value given the small number of samples analysed but are illustrative of the problematic nature of the problem", had purchased the food normally consumed by a four-year-old child at meals and an intermediate meal at supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were studied, as were snacks from laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is shattering: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as potentially or likely carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disrupting factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
'Even if the legal limits for each individual chemical taken are not exceeded in the approximate total of cases, the fact that the consumer is potentially exposed to carcinogens or endocrine disrupting substances is a matter of concern is well understood from this survey,' the association notes.
Already at breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than 10 of the residues that may cause cancer and three have been shown to be safe as carcinogens, as well as more than 20 residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, which was meant as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same is true for the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hawksteak, tuna from the box, even the baguette and chewing gum were spiked with pesticides and other chemicals.
The analysis of the tap water revealed the presence of nitrates and chlorophyll.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 detected chemical residues, and even the plastic kettle used to heat the meal in the microwave was not untouched.
The ultimate risk of this "pollutant cocktail" to consumers "is likely to be underestimated", the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, in view of the urgency of the situation, a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt the 'increase in diseases of civilization'.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
