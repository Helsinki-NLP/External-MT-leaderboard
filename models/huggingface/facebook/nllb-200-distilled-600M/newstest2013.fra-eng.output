A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that election fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on participation rates.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
With this in mind, a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 making it more difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states join.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of voting rights were introduced in 41 states in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the time for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and deprive citizens with a judicial record of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities quickly extended the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of U.S. citizens - 21 million people of voting age - do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a card.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
That's a lot more than that.
Students, who are considered to be voters who vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their institution-issued photo ID cards.
However, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit Hispanic voting.
It turns out that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers sponsored legislation in 2011 that abolished voter registration on election day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the general election of 2004, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the number of new voters registered in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states to reduce the voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33 percent of those who voted early were African-American, while African-Americans made up only 13 percent of the state's electorate.
The same was true of Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, made up only 46% of the early voters.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the pro-democracy nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on participation rates.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
The fact is that the APS test could sometimes produce false results, with false negative or false positive results, which would lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
Which makes even more hesitant men who are already reluctant to take screenings.
Pass the test or not?
We asked two experts for their advice.
In the US studies, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that you have a 30 to 40 percent higher chance of getting metastases if you're not screened.
So I recommend testing from age 50, or from age 40, if you have a direct relative who has had prostate cancer before.
African-American men are also at higher risk.
The key is to make the right decision once you've been diagnosed with cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are lazy.
We really need to make the patient understand the extent of their cancer risk, by offering them the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead opting, in these cases, for active disease surveillance.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We'll suggest active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we'll offer them treatment.
More and more, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being precisely determined.
So I still recommend passing the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to decide whether or not to pass it.
Movember, in collaboration with the International Urological Society, has developed a tool that assesses the pros and cons of the APS test.
The document can be downloaded (for now, a translation will be available soon) at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Preventing illness
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It's estimated that if everyone ate well and moved around enough, we could prevent 30 percent of cancers.
"If no one else smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many remain completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Society maintains that the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85 percent of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
It's a huge health hazard for people.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today", lamented spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging facts: Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer has fallen by half.
Weight
Obesity and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the CCS.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against colon cancer", it adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
Too much of it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
The carcasses are also, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer", it is explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CCS.
While one of them saw a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another saw an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
Mr. Beaulieu also stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Getting a screening test doesn't give you cancer".
The Higgs boson is decortified
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, just that.
And then it's the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model -- our best, or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter -- but that hasn't been empirically observed yet.
But physicists are still not entirely sure that it's actually the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we're holding a genuine new particle, and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely certain.
But suppose it's actually the Higgs, since the odds of being wrong seem slim, and let's see what it's all about.
There is, in this world of the underworld, a inevitable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a strange world, it also has a similar law: Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" consisting largely of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And the other is the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything -- at least not for this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) Berkeley Laboratories' The Particle Adventure site: mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "force particles", through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson is somehow related.
These bosons, it must be pointed out here, are not all such exotic beasts as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is because of an extraordinary banality of a boson: the photon, or "light particle", that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at that precise location, much like a rock thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" gives rise to an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
It's the same with the Higgs boson, except that it's almost the same as another field, the Higgs field, which has to be "disrupted" for that boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, kind of like it's a frozen pond whose surface can only be covered by a very large rock.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN's -- the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! -- to reach such energies.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while others (like the photon, yours) don't.
What is the "benefit" of all this research, Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and predictions of MS.
There are many who would like to see some of them, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physique" and close some holes in the Model.
It is true that the universe still has enormous flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (again!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (again!).
But we haven't found such discrepancies at CERN until now.
The impact
The impact of this research on Mr and Mrs All World's daily life is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
Note: In the early 1960's, the pioneers of laser at Bell Laboratories had no idea what revolution their work would trigger.
They were looking at scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle has already told us - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - the laser was originally seen as a "lab gadget".
I mean, imagine.
And then, applications can also come from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 while working on optics.
This sensor, although not originally intended, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras worldwide, and won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This doesn't mean, of course, that LHC activities will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Commission to Die with Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
But much remains to be done in this vital area.
The duty tried to look at it more closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was eating him had left him with two years of rest.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven", he said, half-figure half-raisin, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it", he says.
The disease is working its way up: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone, even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts help to eat, resigned.
He's brave, he even smiles, he talks to strangers around him, they bring him his medicine, they offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating", he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for the disease.
"In our lifetime, we learn that a man urinates standing up", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
To go back to the childhood stage is, for some people, an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept regression, he notes.
For many palliative care workers, there are great moments in the heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois paediatric care home all have cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no wishes in life anymore", she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provides physical care and nutrition assistance.
It's palliative care, which you give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there are 11 700 people in a palliative care bed.
It's very little when you know we all die one day.
Here life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
We'll accept oral care with brandy or Pepsi on death row, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died last night.
This morning, it's her son who's gonna finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help our loved ones as much as we help our patients", says Nathalie Savard, director of health care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days go by, but they're not the same.
Alongside a 93-year-old man enjoying his last family gathering in the courtyard, well-closed in his pillows while a drink is being made in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife, and two young children, after trying to survive.
"For six months now, there are still three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under 45", says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate pain when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this large shortage of health care in Quebec that has caused many palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October a manifesto, signed by the leaders of the palliative care community, including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
She says that recently, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room in great pain, without any relief.
I'm afraid some patients are asking to die just because they're not getting the right care.
And at the same time, many oncologists are sticking to their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helen Richard's survival prospects were already low when she abandoned the stressful chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist I was stopping treatment, she said she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
She told me I was done!
No Almighty Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank their caregivers for not acceding to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not necessarily all-powerful in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are reported to be reluctant to receive pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often use paleo-medication, which is used to put the patient back to sleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
You can't pretend you don't hear that part of the pain anymore.
More and more, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase, "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to euthanasize me", it means, "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP contractors, political party fundraisers and specialists in the Italian mafia are telling people day after day what they know about a formidable "system" that includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
This is an industry that has cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system has been falling apart since we took the big money", says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
He was the source of the scandal in 2011, through a thorough investigation into fraud related to road works contracts in Quebec, which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only agreed to back down.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, party financing and corruption of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts", he says, some controlling their instincts to reach a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he added, hoping to "demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the "Hammer Squad" cops who, since 2009, have led the Montreal Sewer Cartel to put the soft pedal on contract inflation...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of searches and has been charged with fraud and corruption against municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
He is suspected of repeatedly taking bribes in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, engineers on the streets of Montreal and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, are formally charged.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the Commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3 percent of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked broker who was reimbursing money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has been a successful businessman since the 2000s, donating over 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, most notably the then-ruling Liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts which he inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was running rampant.
Gilles Surprising, a former civil engineer, told the commission that in ten years he had received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736,000 in exchange for contracts for sewerage, which he inflated.
Other road officials admitted to getting fat on their feet by inflating bills by 30 to 40 percent, with fake extras.
Then a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget that fed his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she has been protesting since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and sold back... 1.6 million to developers, in the middle of a real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will eventually be launched, she says, "takes a wire to understand how the system, infiltrated by ants, works to stop gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but we're gonna need a Montreal-based investigation unit and a day before, so we don't see any more suspicious practices.
Like we do the housework.
- I do it regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elects aware of the scheme", when they are not in the middle of the pack!
Estimating that 70% of dirty money is used to finance electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told that this was only a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government is proposing to limit party donations to $100 but this will not change the situation, he said: "Until we strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics".
He called for a complete overhaul of the system of public procurement and party financing: "You cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things with courage will help rebuild the house on a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own courtyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day I'm making progress alongside them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements make me play more.
And in a game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not getting burned.
From my beginnings at the INF Pre-training Centre in Clairefontaine to my move to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by stairs.
So you're taking advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face up and provide the best.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti has been a great influence on my position.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man in the situation?
- Of course you do.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he is unrivalled in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience and won a lot of titles with the clubs.
He's been around some great players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
How do you feel about the first game of the season for PSG ?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the final eight with the way.
What is the club's aim in this competition?
We're gonna try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we'll have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our hen, before Porto, so we can get back in the eighth round.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and sign up for the duration.
Today, that is not the case.
The PSG is providing financial support for this project.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
Last season, we didn't get far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a really big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
I think this year's the one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's only natural that we expect a lot from ourselves given what we've invested and the players we have.
We're totally in agreement.
After that, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame, it's sure to be a little frustrating.
You wonder what else people expect.
We're never gonna be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game plan.
A team builds with time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer in person.
Look at Manchester City who have not been able to qualify for the final eight for two seasons, they have also spent a lot of money!
Looking at the money invested, we thought you were 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was a complete disregard for our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
That shows how exciting Ligue 1 is.
I hope that in May we can have the smile to tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties we finally won.
PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better say there is a "Zlatan addiction".
That means Ibrahimovic is very good and he scores a lot of goals.
He came here for this and he's proving he's the star of League One.
He's shown everywhere he's gone that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, is also helping everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's such a disappointment.
I wanted to be a part of that Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from cramming in time for the game.
I saw things there and I came out strong.
I'm able to make good games in the national team now.
That's what I've been hoping for since I got baptized with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must now set an example.
How do you feel about Didier Deschamps ' first few months as the Blues ' leader ?
He's got the results for himself.
We're well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is strict, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc had reached his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads the Blues to Brazil.
Is the draw of 1-1 on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before the shock in Spain, I had never seen a game like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
The opposite is true of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often happens in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, which is made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent-like exchange protocol, which allows for peer-to-peer file exchange.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
After reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, the price of bitcoin fell to $2 five months later, before falling back to around $10 today (the prices are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive compared to the global exchange of real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is distinct from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", which are used to progress in a video game that is won by playing or can be bought (and sometimes exchanged in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes the trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both bookkeepers, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two email addresses in the form of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file also make it possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged are well kept in the public ledger, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction into this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that extra line.
This is a file hashing phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter, unique digital fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "making" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes can easily verify that it's the right one.
The transaction is then inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, for fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided in half regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
So the number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundred millionth, leaving room for...
The difficulty of the challenge is also highlighted with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has had its ups and downs.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The flaw used is not the protocol itself", says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Weight-bearing actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, "giant soldiers" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who also authored an educational book on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its Paytunia system is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which is cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they need is an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if the currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What happened after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US should follow in late 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take back their territory and for the Afghans to choose their future without expecting anything from us.
It is the Afghan peasants that we have punished as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse to be accompanied by foreign troops, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will not be tolerated when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul uninjured, overrun by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban outbreak in Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the land on fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these farmers outnumbered by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are joining forces in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become businessmen, seizing government lands to sell them back to the refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, with huge U.S. subcontracting deals.
They were not considerate; most of them were not fighting themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have benefited from the American bounty: capital flight is considerable.
The young are tired of war and its ideologies.
They've been around the modern world when they were in exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they've enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25, and now Kabul has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, boys and girls.
We will have to provide work for these young people who will not want to return to the obscurity of old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including armed opponents, is a fan of cell phones; TV and its Turkish TV series, which present a modern world, are everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to enjoy some decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has been restored, no dams are in good condition, no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ravaged by 30 years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
Rumors were spread that Afghanistan had immense mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the West was only here to take it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, or transportation to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
It will also take some time for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' secondary school, French department at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of bringing aid and offensive actions together, a "civil-military actions" department of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and is being carried out by a small French NGO, numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
These local labourers, who were eager to help contain the insurrection, were able to do so: irrigate, well, clean water, reforestation, fruit trees, protect the soil and increase the cultivated area.
What will we leave as a memory after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the local conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to escape the insurrection of foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, they must be given a small, well-controlled civil assistance that directly affects them.
A Constitution in Force in Egypt
This is another poker move by President Mohammed Morsi.
As Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provides it with provisional full powers, he decided to play his part.
He briefly announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave this Assembly two more months to finish its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which has weakened institutional stability and led to legal loopholes.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "betray his word" and "trample on the law".
The Commission's supporters are assured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forced the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
The President also sees it as a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as the country is in a state of protest.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he asserted in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The use of a rushed vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I hold full power", and it is supposed to end after the Constitution is adopted.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent assembly, overwhelmingly Islamists, voted yesterday on the text.
Most of the Liberals were out of the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, feeling that they could not defend their views.
Human rights, religious minorities, and civil society representatives had done the same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 alternate members were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were voted unanimously most often.
Some commentators have also joked that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, with some members of the committee feeling that the pendulum of the constituency was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, has 234 articles.
The article 2 of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law", is the same.
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the Liberals reply, seeing it as a communication.
Because they believe that Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular in verifying compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egyptologist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
It is the beginning of a theocracy".
The Liberals are further alarmed that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text were not scholars but scholars, for some trained in the French system", says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "there may be ambiguity about Article 220, because the terms used are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
The term "fiqh" is used in particular in the Islamic legal system.
And the question may in the future be how competent civil judges are to rule on this issue".
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another issue is the powers conferred on the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will civil trials in military courts be banned, as human rights organizations have demanded.
The Commission also expressed concerns about the text, which it considers to be libertarian.
The offense of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Moreover, no article echoes the protection of women anymore, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
She said the only positive thing is the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The President's support will march on them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Center and a sea of brimstone await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land was filled with Bible truth, modern comfort, and wildlife.
Argoumenty i Fakty has listed five main reasons why you should visit Israel.
Go to the holy places to worship
Go to the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone entering these "baptism grounds" will be affected by divine grace.
But Galilee was the land of Jesus' miracles - where water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on water, calmed the storm, and where he performed miraculous fisheries.
It was there that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But where you'll find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
The believers walk through it on the Street of Suffering or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins near the Antonia fortress (prince's palace), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the place of the Anointing Stone and burial.
It is the center of the Christian world, a symbol of humanity's salvation.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is built on the spot where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the Jewish holiest place, the Wall of Mourning, which is the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.E.
Tradition has it that people of different faiths leave little words and prayers in the Bible and are then answered.
Traveling in heights
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, a former refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineers can get there on their own.
For others, a cable car takes them to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of between 1,600 and 2,040 m, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
Old beliefs say that pagan gods once lived on the top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It's impossible to visit them all in one stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First, the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It is home to the very old Qumran, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art
It mainly exhibits paintings by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moulds from visitors and watchers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem Memorial, in Tel Aviv, which is one of the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go in there and you go into a total darkness.
The stars are shining.
You heard the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and wellbeing
Israel's three major seaports are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Dead Sea.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and giant aquariums.
Note that you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not drop below 21°C while the air temperature can reach 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year long.
It is the world's most unique sea, and it is the lowest point on Earth, at 417 meters below sea level.
The blue water contains brine and is very easy to hold back from swimming, even those who cannot swim.
The landscapes around it are surreal.
They come to treat with salt water, mud, and curative mud and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also simply to relax.
Discover the secrets of ancient times
They are guarded by the ancient city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
Legend has it that Noah built his ark here and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially enjoy walking along narrow alleys named after the zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to your sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will meet newlyweds who have come to take pictures from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesar's city, King Herod's, you can wander into the Roman theater, "conquering" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your English. About 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to euros, since they are easily exchanged for shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
The main transportation in the city is by bus, but Jerusalem has a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations that can connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost like an underground funicular.
The cost of all public transport is 6 shekels and you can make changes for 1:30 hours.
In Israel, Jewish tradition requires that the Sabbath be observed on Saturday.
From Friday evening to Saturday sunset, markets, shops and public transportation cease operations.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
There are a multitude of dishes made with lamb and beef, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, various sauces, ground chicken peas, falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, many well-fed cats are seen walking around in a proud air.
You can see them sleeping on the rooftops of parked cars at night.
These felines love passing places and don't refuse to be given a gift.
Car rental varies according to the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
The average entrance to the museum costs 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who had come to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visas were cancelled on 9 February 2011.
"Whoever has a language goes to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
While lawmakers and human rights activists are debating what the compulsory language test law will do, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who are left at home.
Since 1 December, a law has been in force and stipulates that every migrant worker must pass a Russian language exam.
At present, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sectors.
However, in time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
The Commission will also have to approve the language, the history of Russia and the legal basis.
You will need to validate your knowledge of Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian is the official language are exempt.
The law also excludes those who had obtained certificates or degrees in education before the fall of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all cities of the country, with more than 160 centres already set up throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders had already repeatedly asked the press: What will it bring?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, the Migration Department says, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, says Victor Sebelev, director of the Russian Federal Migration Service's office in Tajikistan.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organised selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future migrant is destined to encounter dishonest people who, under the guise of helping him, will provide him with a "journey" to a crowded little house where he and dozens of his fellow immigrants will be tortured for months without food and paper and have to sleep between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We've been getting a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised something, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken away, and they do not get the expected salary", confirms Tolib Charipov, Head of the Directorate of Migration for Work of the Tajikistan Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, officer!
However, many Central Asian citizens who wish to come to Russia to earn money confess that they not only do not know the language of the country they wish to visit but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajik can afford even a passing primary education.
Their families have no food to feed their children, not to mention proper clothing and school equipment.
As soon as they reach adolescence, they start earning money as soon as they have the opportunity.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they confide.
"You feel diminished and diminished".
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of language law.
The examinations will be for migrants with legal status only.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work afterwards.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defend yourself"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is the administrative barriers and still these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then you can get a fake recording quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know we have fake documents, we don't have a record, hence extortion cases.
"They ask us for 100-200 rubles, for cigarettes, for tea", said Tajik journalist Umad Khushkadamov.
"Hurry, do not tire and buy yourself a fine artwork"
From the first day the language law came into force, it was discovered that immigrant registration documents were not the only ones that were fake.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by the Federal Migration Service.
The counterfeit paper comes out of a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not disappointed: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the examination task had to pay 7,000 rubles for the document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The government and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "bits of paper".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have failed the first examination time to take language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Interior Ministry proposes to tighten the law against civilian gun owners.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it was the shooting at weddings or the murder organized by Moscow jurist Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to ban the carrying of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age to obtain a gun permit by raising the age from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "closing screws".
An open letter appeared on the Internet in which the authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded that "this senseless hardening be abandoned".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, in a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168,000 crimes were registered in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that strengthening the laws on civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from sourcing their supplies from the black market.
They say that any weapon can be found in Moscow today at a reasonable price.
However, the Interior Ministry says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market for weapons is being supplied through several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and at Headquarters.
Screenshot from a gun control site
The first is "military trace", i.e. weapons stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians", explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons that come from the black market are those that criminals steal from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stores and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns are on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have been hit by explosions.
"A number of documented versions indicate that some fires were deliberately set to cover the shortfall", explains the former military officer.
Baranets thinks the gun makers are doing something.
"We see private arms factories that do not compete with international competition and sell arms on the black market, especially in Moscow", says one expert.
Another source of black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and is organizing the supply", the former military adds.
Where did the guns come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market have been found there, the report says, "because of employees whose work is related to weapons".
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen during manufacture and 5% come from "clandestine smuggling".
A gun dealer and consultant who asked to be kept anonymous said that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these specialists in the secret excavation; they are too old.
He said that most of the time, the sellers go to the military warehouses to get the new goods.
The person purchases a unit through a sign, for example a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a grid.
"He transports it to the city and sells it back for 900 euros per unit with two chargers", he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers", adds the seller.
"Like in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I went through websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "corner" to shop.
The price of the gun, I got it on the spot.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
"I know someone, but I don't trust them", explains the salesman.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to come and say, for example, "From someone like this, who asked me to tell you that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give it.
The new kids look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, haven't changed.
We gave him a photo album that said "everything you want".
"I thought I was in a luxury store", recalls the soldier.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller into the woods and we set up a target.
"I'm fired and when I'm convinced the weapon works well, we start negotiating", the expert describes.
A shop from the couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For that, we don't need any documents and no one to meet.
"You just have to have a certain amount of money", says a commercial on the website "Buy a gun or a machine gun".
Users leave their request and ask questions.
And we sell to miners?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Purchase TT. Moscow", Fedorenkov writes in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and is raiding people who want to buy combat weapons.
People run for food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I've heard of this kind of schemes: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take the lead.
The buyer shall make the payment at the automatic terminals.
"He gets a photo and instructions on where the weapon is hidden", explains Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the Right to a Gun Association.
Victor Baranets says that by applying on the site, you can end up without a gun and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and is raiding people who want to buy combat weapons.
"People run for food like hungry wolves and then find themselves mining coal in Siberia", he says.
A Makarov for 100 bucks
Experts estimate that buying an illegal firearm can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to a Gun Association, a Makarov pistol can be bought for $100-300.
It'll take about a month and a half.
It was taken out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the Ministry, in comparison with the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7% overall to 22.9 miles while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.

Nearly a quarter of American teenagers work as a cashier at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has been mounting against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At this time, no one can predict whether this wave will increase in intensity or slowly exhale.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Alongside the rise in the modest salaries of Walmart and fast food chains, the organizers of the protests are seeking to get unions formed.
This sector is not covered by the trade union movement at the moment.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, on "Black Friday", when a torrential downpour of balances swept through America, sometimes triggering scandals.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize strike picketing with unions and leftist activists in the company's stores whose products are aimed at middle- and lower-class consumers.
Walmart sells everything from blankets to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, products are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain of difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifting cars or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded a pay rise, they complained that the price of the company's medical insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For the basic worker at Walmart who makes $9.5 an hour, that's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raised the average hourly wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That's 1.1 percent more than he's spending now.
If Walmart were to transfer all the pay increases to consumers, every run in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They'll spend only $12.39 more in one year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8pm to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second over that period.
His coffers made a total of 100 million transactions for Black Friday.
The company's spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was only "an operation like many others" by the organizing union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York City and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, so they are not yet established there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces they're selling billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage required by federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food companies increase it over time, but on average, its basic employees earn $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one touches them less than they do in this town.
I don't think it's possible for me to live with that kind of money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with that salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, there are comments that it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Protesters who started the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food chefs be paid a minimum of $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing the protest and punishing union protesters by firing or firing.
However, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
For a union, catering fast food is still a difficult task, and for concrete reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They disagree.
Other tumultuous protests were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including Jumaane Williams, a city councillor, who said: "McDonald's announces that they sell billions of servings and after that they don't even give you sick leave and pay you for the honest work you've done!"
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said that "we all need to support fast food workers so they get the fair pay and economic well-being every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times described this event as the largest fast food industry event in its history.
But only a few hundred people took part, not all of them fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is difficult to say at this time whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"At the moment, the only way to fool the brain is to trick the brain"
Lately, fans of new technology have become accustomed to seeing augmented reality through special glasses.
Google first unveiled its current model at its annual conference this summer, and in November it was reported that Microsoft had filed for the patent.
However, it appears from an interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Shahram Izadi, that for the company's scientists, glasses are already a thing of the past.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating virtual open spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group does?
- We're working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we're trying to broaden the boundaries of that interaction.
Humanity as a whole has been left with pixels on flat screen and sometimes touch screen for the time being.
We want to look at five to 10 years ahead and guess what radical changes will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in command by gesture.
- What else is in store for us?
- Although the Kinect has rendered physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on really 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to bring the computer world out into our own, into the physical world, make it more tangible.
However, this requires not only identifying the user but also the space around him.
So we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And first, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command ?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overrated?
The question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of our actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of computer interaction is good, but each in its own niche.
For example, when we were ordering the devices in public places, we had a project where we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera but by a wristband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean, "the one"?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- I usually only talk.
- Oh, it's going to be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or can't do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think very soon we'll have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolution in depth and that's very important.
- If we're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what's not to love about modern cameras?
Are they lacking resolution, depth, or something else?
- Basically, it's the current generation we're building on in our work on 3D recognition.
Obviously, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to the latter, all the current technologies are pretty good, adding to the work of algorithm designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind for the X and Y axes, but also for the Z axes.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s really isn't enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche of our Redmond lab gave the touch of the sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
I'd really need a camera like that in my work, but not requiring touch, to get more frames a second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second one is a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a regular field of view sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help define locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not shown its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the perspective of the everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, walking around with your hands up all the time with a smartphone is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transitional" augmented reality that would allow you to move from a cloud platform to a smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device, and that's what makes them strong (personal elements are the only ones you see) and at the same time their weakness: Augmented reality from glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the common mortal.
There is one problem that those who oppose this idea point to: there is no sense of touch!
The hands can't feel anything!
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth one might very well be the addition of touch sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is using the second hand as a picture medium.
It's a perfect record of pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give palpability to these "air images": for example, interference by several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is and which gives you the feeling, for the moment, of a breath of air on the tips of your fingers.
There are also wristbands that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspective.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still a task below which it will take a long time to work hard on: how to make someone who is physically in a very narrow space think they are walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of race carpets (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only fool the brain with a medium, and there are still many years of work to do.
That's what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The rule of taste, not culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "The Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the city's people who are at the forefront of culture and art.
This highly selective list has already welcomed prominent artists from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements extend beyond the city's borders and have gained recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded, red-clad man who can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, or at fashionable parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always bring crowds together, no matter where they are on display.
He is one of the most socially and philosophic St. Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller was a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and makes them feel good.
He recently took over a Barbary organ and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg as he was mature enough for this difficult role through his existence, philosophy and image as a Bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you walking around town all red and not in yellow or turquoise blue?
- I chose red as a stylist specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image maker and society.
Even if anything that is not grey in society is a source of aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free ones, like me, were misunderstood.
I started to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I'm interested in theater, fashion, music, all kinds of things except words.
And all of this ended up in your art clinic... it was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took a seat in Pushkinskaya-10 which was home to a music and art club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Petrograd Bohemian.
Many of them were born there: NOM, Tequila-Jazz, I still see Chnour coming up with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy playback songs in moulded shirts, including today's fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career began, but his basic training and education was at home.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboedov": these are repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I'm a hero of the last century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a press poll was held: it was the "City personalities" award.
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign ended.
It's not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I'm a representative of truth, honesty and the culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a cultural person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very high level of actuality and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through the Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be a social person, but now it hurts and it's scary to be like this.
But with clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it's the outfit that matters, the outward mechanism that matters, but not the inner person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we should spit in his trunk.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- We saw you playing the organist in Barbary recently.
Who else can play it but me?
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful too?
- Today commercial art must be neat, delicate, liquor.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
In the past, people were divided into herds, bohemians liked one thing, fools another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everybody.
Today, you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and in the end it's less management, less money, it's all gone.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to ruin the experience.
When I was young, I used to paint paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones you paint at the end of your life.
Today, people often confuse ideas.
They say there's a spiritual culture, a consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money for painting precisely.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand culture well, but they understood that you had to keep the good experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're being left out, because we need higher-level experts who will properly evaluate these experts and pave the way for them.
Today, the "reign of taste" is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they don't take all contemporary art, that there are painters who need to be in other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our rocks, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, which is bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who go to exhibitions, concerts.
This is a very fine sheet in our house.
We must make art as fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project supported by the St. Petersburg Scholarship
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with landers on board set off in search of a planet of relief.
To save humanity, a big question arises: How can we keep our species alive in a weightless state or on a life-saving planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, even if only by hypothesis.
"It's Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If Mars is more suitable for life, the surface temperature on Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live there at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to take an interest in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, we were experimenting on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit were no different from the terrestrial varieties.
Then we put insects, small, breeding drosophilic flies, into orbit.
In 1979, sperm whales were sent into space to see how an embryo grows in weight.
You get a perfectly normal chicken out.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chicken needs to find a support, get on its feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medicinal Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
Without any support, the chicks moved in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chickens were not responding to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die within four days.
"We had to close our eyes twice and then we gave up because it was simply impossible to work with them there", explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was launched into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, Bion will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, we have not discovered anything supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites, and then it's the only experiment", observed Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproduction is not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a small matter.
The animals lose their normal environment and are unable to fulfill their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans are capable of doing so, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not done for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what mankind has most in value.
Our whale flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive a flight into space.
If she could have had a baby after the robbery.
"No one answered that question", explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired rocket and space scientist.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Terechkova, gave birth to a baby girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been in orbit twice and even worked in an off-road environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it is dangerous even during orbital flight", concludes the Soviet Union's hero and Russian hero, the pilot and cosmonaut Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonaut Training Centre: a mandatory step in the preparation for flight.
Here, with zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train for off-road excursions.
Water mimics weight.
While the water is comfortable for adults but a strange environment, for infants it is their real element.
The little amphibians seem to confirm that life on Earth originated in the ocean.
As the baby develops in the lymphatic fluid of the mother's womb for about nine months, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
This makes sense, in principle, because from birth to first bathing, it takes only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget", explains Marina Aksenova, a swimming instructor for infants.
In a nutshell, if for the newborn baby, weight is a more natural condition, the woman needs gravity, weight strength.
When the baby is overweight, the muscles of the abdomen and pelvis atrophy very quickly, and the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
Of course, you can prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will be able to get it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov, inviting us to think about this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the body does not feel the earth's pull, it cannot form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You can't dress a baby like an adult with a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experiment we would consider in this case by imagining a child being born in a foreign environment will result in a disabled child returning to Earth, completely unfit", predicts Igor Pestov, Director of the Committee for Bioethics at the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality when the Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the home of their spaceship-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Supreme Financial Control Institute) said: "The control of the pseudo-independent work (in Czech 'Svarc system') has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but is lagging behind in its application.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, the vice president of the Higher Financial Control Institute in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and I think that's what we lack", Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of Petr Nečas to the "Svarc system".
Mr Prime Minister recently said that the SDGs are not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls; so is it allowed or prohibited ?
"The law must be enforced in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an inspection authority from going to demand compliance with the law", says Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on Auditors in the Chamber of Deputies you referred to a Czech-German draft in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and practice itself follow it.
We have put all this together and although this inspection procedure is not yet complete, we have found some very interesting differences: in general speaking, our legislation may be 'more stringent and of better quality', but, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to develop ever more detailed rules but that it is necessary to focus on the very application of the law.
How can this project help you in concrete terms and what will be the result for you?
This kind of joint control should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, lower and improve the thresholds when this has no real positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the item at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those who look for flaws in it will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As regards institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof, like the ISC, operates there in a similar manner, and it also has a slightly different board, but these two institutions operate essentially in a similar way.
The competencies are also similar to a certain extent, with a slight contrast to our system: Germany is a federal structure and therefore has similar accounts at the level of the various Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to state resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities in our country are controlled at the level of the Länder' accounts.
Is the national legislation simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model but it cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, I'm sure not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country which we consider a model also faces a whole series of problems.
Otherwise, they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As regards national legislation, what has the amendment to the public procurement law meant for you as an institution?
This amendment has not yet had an impact on our control operations, as it has come into force relatively recently.
Since we're doing a post-examination, we have to count on a delay.
Our comments concern only the process of preparing future checks - we have launched a new 'mismanagement risk detection' tool which has been used to identify almost 14 000 public procurements - and these changes will of course be felt, because thresholds have been changed and the conditions for certain types of tender procedures have been changed and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law more of an advantage or an added burden to the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) obliged the controlled entities to accept that any infringement of the market law constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not like that, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without impacting the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently the Prime Minister said that the SDGs would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system banned or authorized?
The law must be enforced in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it", but he can't say we're going to act like nothing happened.
The market law has relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a tenderer is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law can never be perfect, but the application of it must be just and I think that's what we lack.
The roads are frozen, but most of them are still usable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowed.
However, the network remains largely practicable, with increased vigilance in some places.
The Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, roads were easy to drive this morning, but in places with frost and snow.
Temperatures have dropped and fluctuated between -5 and -10 degrees Celsius but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
The snow has stopped falling in the region and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the peaks of the Krušné hory are covered by about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service shows that due to fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 motorway and the national roads in the region are now easy to use.
However, caution is still necessary, for example on some bridges where the coating may be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still remains of frozen snow on some of their tracts and in traffic-crushed places.
Drivers must be more vigilant, especially in high-altitude areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions
The Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that snow-capped traffic can be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in the Pardubice region at high altitudes.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is found mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts, a snow layer is present on the roads in the high altitude areas.
In eastern Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, usually clear, with possibly cloudy passages.
There will be a low wind and temperatures will usually range from -3°C to +1°C.
Region of Pilsen
Roads in the Pilsen area are now practical, although in some places more vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions are needed.
It's freezing this morning, temperatures are between -3 and -9 degrees.
After the last snowfall and the subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be through frozen areas.
Drivers can expect to cross foggy areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is shown in the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway is practically easy to use, but the road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coating on most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some parts may be frozen in the South Pilsen district and in the Tachov district.
The departments and third category roads are wet and the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less busy roads in the Šumava region.
The Olomouc Region
Drivers traveling to the higher elevations of Olomouc must now expect thick, soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road to Videlský kříž after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance workers to the field that night, and according to the road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are easy to use.
"On the heights of the Šumperk district are the remains of snow.
Drivers driving towards Jeseník should expect to encounter a thick and soft layer of snow at the Kervenohorské sedlo", the head of road maintenance services in the Šumperk district told ČTK today.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also visited the area during the night, and they said that after the chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are easy to use, but in the Šternberk district drivers should be careful in sections in forested areas with wet roads.
The regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, the Northern Bohemian road maintenance services reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered by snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads.
No traffic problems have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and freezing at night.
The main traffic axes also report difficult conditions on the national road 13 on the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The traffic between Telnice and Knínice is closed due to tree branches that have bent under the weight of the snow to the road.
Šimon Ornest said: "Together we want to collect positive energy".
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news stories, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh at it and think we're the only group that can collect some positive energy to push back or prevent the end of the world.
And you're having a very unique project in December: three concerts about the end of the world.
Can you give more details about this project to our readers?
This is a charity we've been preparing for for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the eve of the 20th of December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end virtually at the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed it with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Aside from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support by purchasing online at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded a world-ending anthem titled "End of the Cancelled World" (Czech: Konec světa zrušeno).
She's already very popular on YouTube, will you hear her at these charity concerts?
Of course, in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't happen...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in all three concerts.
The hymns will also be joined at some point in a very unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, Xindl X also sings in it...
How did you get to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech showbiz personalities, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We are working hard to get them to take an active part in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts be for against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest them and amuse them.
The students themselves cannot afford to attend classes, so we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we will move this project to a new independent building.
Will multiple bands and performers take the stage at each of these concerts?
What criteria did you use to choose them?
We tried to develop a program that was aimed at all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be on stage.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you preparing for other mega events like this in the future?
In May we will play for the first time in Prague as part of the Spring, and we will surely prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic House in New York and personally, once we are in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap is a disabled group.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it looks at first.
We have five electric wheelchairs, which have to be loaded, and of course we also carry a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
Until now everything has been more or less always going well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have you been through so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have seen in Moscow that all the eastern parts are still in an early stage.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to disabled people, and it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the city centre.
They still do not consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being set up to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities.
How else do we catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
It is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, and you, The Tap Tap, are on the forefront of progress on this point.
Respect for the public and easy access are one thing, but things will really start to change when we have among us famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
At the moment, these are only a few cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what made you start this band in 1998?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I'm a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we started a music business.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we lost some control of the situation. (Laughter)
Success only came in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
True, building relationships with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We've learned that if a work isn't visible, it's as if it doesn't exist in the background.
The European Union's grants can also help us to have quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you set out to reach that level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
Show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: anything new is accepted with caution and lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person seeing us for the first time is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But compassion is completely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned by everyone, whom we should have compassion for.
They are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided they have the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it's not just a breakthrough for them but for the whole society.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you're a demanding leader, as many people call you?
If we want to do good work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to our house with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
There's only one, Láďa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and go out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to anyone who wants to join us.
This will be the day before the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012, from 9:00 p.m.
The event will take place in Prague at the Incheba Arena, Brno in Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, the three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the band The Tap Tap will sing together the song "End of the World Cancelled".
The aim of the concert is to raise funds (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional training centre Studeo in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
Tickets for this concert are 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, ticket sales are open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed took part in a number of ESA projects.
However, Poland's journey to space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, enthusiastic Poles were working on spaceflight; they did not always get along.
I would like to recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw on December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas from his groundbreaking book "An Introduction to Astronomy".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a major proponent of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned promoter of astronomy, and his contribution was rewarded by the fact that one of the craters on the Moon's hidden face was named after him.
As early as 1925 a dredge was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, we don't know who wrote this project or the details of it.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to propel or to brake the drill.
The only known information about this drill is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the preserved documents that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of German troops, the search was interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by author Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of operation, the war began and its activities were terminated.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
A company was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of Problème, which contained four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronomy.
By this time, artificial satellites had already been launched, and it was clear that space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and from the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM Meteorological Rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This 1,800-meter-range rocket was 80 centimetres long and weighed just under five kilograms.
Later an improved version, RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was about a foot long and probably weighed 11.5 kilograms.
The next prototype should have been capable of performing concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all the development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965 succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
The rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the aeronautical institute, and the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland joined COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and that a national COSPAR committee was established two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut in this programme.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the Public Works Act.
This decision has been the subject of much public debate.
It is certainly interesting to examine this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the various economic entities and national economic systems are in perpetual conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and the free (unlimited) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) create price pressure.
The following meaning of the term should be given: a producer, by importing goods sold at low prices, strives to resist economic competition by 'making the price of the competitor more expensive', with the aim of taking a larger share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, to buy cheaply or to disappear.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it creates, the social burden of the State necessarily increases.
This situation intensifies the unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this profit-making race.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital have led to a situation in different economies in which governments in different countries are forced to enter into mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the existing laws.
The aim is to force its own population to accept the dictate of private capital prices, particularly in the wage field.
This is achieved, on the one hand, by a system of economic constraints in the event of longterm unemployment and, on the other hand, by restricting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is increasing and the gap between rich and poor is deepening.
In the FRG, public food distribution points have been in place for years for the poor who cannot support themselves by their own work.
We already count millions of these people.
As the competitiveness of the German economy increases, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a surcharge to ensure that they reach the minimum wage.
Such a scandal has been updated, for example, in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live on the margins of society with poor wages in the hope that private capital will one day invest in their countries.
The question here is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are tired of saying that the state cannot invest capital in its own economy, because the controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
The question then arises whether private capital does not influence and even direct politics and, by doing so, the whole State, in accordance with its own selfish interests.
The answer to that question is no doubt yes.
The evidence for this is that there is a practically all-powerful lobby in every state.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in the provision of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the RFA, the situation is such that, due to lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of laws to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracies are now rapidly facing the situation described by Appian in his book "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Times of Caesar and Pompey": "The state had long been in a state of disrepair and its functions were assigned by violence.
Bribery, illegal favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-the-table and corruption proliferated endlessly and the people went to the elections with votes already sold"... ... "Honest people did not seek office at all, resulting in the State being left without consuls for 8 months".... 'It really began to be said that the cure to this difficult situation was autocracy and that an energetic man had to be chosen"... Appianus had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who irreversibly turned democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, modern society is based on the preference for personal gain, without regard to the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and to assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result is an unprecedented decline in elites today as in the past, with no effort to make any major reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present situation, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely ignorant of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human lives being lost, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen investment in state capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the lab of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will", says Sting in the song Fragile, whose main chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be no wars", said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take Israel's side, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide of Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is guilty and who is the victim in its repeated waves of killing; in fact, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the Autonomous Territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a view from behind the scenes of the one who is mainly benefiting from the tensions that have been going on for more than 95 years (since the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others come from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In each age, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to someone who directed their actions according to pre-defined goals.
We must admit that we live in an age where the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration of power cannot have been achieved in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth, the Rothschild family stands out in particular, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know whether these families still have a leader but I do not exclude him).
Little is written about them.
Of course you do.
In the 1990s, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) to stop the link between their name and the serious crimes they were involved in that had always meant a rise in power, an increase in wealth, or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up to this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America's central bank status and began issuing his own money during the Civil War (governmental, I mean) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK started issuing his own money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he was trying to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second to suppress colonialism, particularly British colonialism, and the third to reduce the world population from 1 to 0.5 billion people (such a large number of slaves is enough for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution), and finally to gain absolute power.
The method used by the richest family clan with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are wrong and still lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed to prevent a recurrence of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After succeeding in starting World War I by assassinating in Sarajevo Ferdinand, Habsburg's heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended abruptly with a German surrender without economic or military justification (war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the Central European power.
To make the Second World War easier, the bankers allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany far-reaching war reparations thus generating the conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses (they then had to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing the finger at the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who was to play the role (and indeed held) of the fifth to set the columns on fire and start a war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the establishment of a Jewish state, preferably in the historic Judean region with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundation for a massive Jewish emigration to Palestine and the first friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or whether everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps laid the foundation for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as war reparations imposed on Germany were the cause of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel set a fire that could trigger a third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during World War II, the first casualty of fighting, this time as will the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but internationally (just look at how sharply people are divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong causes another wrong in an endless cycle of violence and where the greed of some individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world are at the root of everything?
We must distinguish between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only propose to the people their own candidates for elections.
The current Israeli prime minister is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in his power to start a war with Iran, which could, due to the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand into a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of all world oil passes (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and cause destruction of the world economy.
In what light are now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order?"
They think that the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth with an electronic chip that makes him a completely controlled being.
"They will make everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a scarlet mark on their hands or foreheads, so that no one can buy or sell anything except the one who has the name of the beast or the number of its name.
Let the one who has the sense count the number of the wild beast.
This number is the man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six".
The movie Argo: When things go wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a group of Islamic students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who after the revolution had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not give the US administration a positive outcome, because it could not abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, the hostages were not able to be released.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, further compounded later by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The sequestered diplomats were finally released after 444 days, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, depicts an episode of this story that gave America a small victory.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After a complicated ordeal, they were reunited at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a rock-climbing cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make a landmark for the filming of a major science fiction film.
Combination of sexes
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires Hollywood to work with him.
To make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on the film project, press conferences were held, and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained a secret for a long time, as the film was based on memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is part of a realistically conceived political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
The scenes are sequential: documentary-style footage of Tehran (subtitled footage shows iconic photographs of the time of the events and how, thanks to these photos, the same situations were retranscribed in the film, there are no major differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with men in costumes discussing the situation around conference tables, in the halls and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in remarkable ways.
He was ridiculed as an actor, became a respected director, and his acting career stopped arousing ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the darkly-themed police drama Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The Town (2010).
It is also the first of Affleck's films not to take place in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his early films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real events; the initial sequence of the embassy fall is impressive in clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is being written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director must have settled for a subject that in fact offered few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
It is very successful, sometimes adding elements to reality and the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is turned away by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway is quite a drag).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipative nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-workers, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are far from alone in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it is seen with moderate interest, appreciating the 70s's re-making and style.
He's drawing the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the job.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a public survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the most absurd regulations or ideas from the "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is recently considering adopting a quota of 40 percent women for the management of major European companies has been the basis of our decision", said Patrik Nacher, the survey's organizer, to the Právo newspaper.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the work of the European Parliament.
Until now, however, women have been given the advantage of life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the 'EU workshop'.
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", Nacher informed.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the requirement to add bio-components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition on using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the actual prohibition of the use of the term 'tasting butter' or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
The quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose claims are usually defended in Brussels by a State or group of States (the Czech Republic is thus currently imposing the claims of its banks by threatening to exercise its veto power).
The interests of pressure groups are also driven, for example, by the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an 'abnormal curvature'.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The rules on fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that inflatable balloons must have a warning that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a US survey that found balloons to be the leading cause of childhood deaths from choking among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing in fair trumpets.
We have weird ideas here too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone holding an official position within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In this investigation, in collaboration with the Laissez Faire association of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com mentioned, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum food stocks that could be in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession.
The Czech Republic then exceeded the volume of canned mushrooms and was therefore subject to a heavy fine.
The organisers of the survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and to grant grants to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"Not having a sea is a handicap.
We will ask the European Union for a refund.' This was the view expressed in the autumn of 2004 by the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and following so-called 'interventionist' purchases, the State had left with full stocks which it had to export.
Palas said the EU should have paid us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for the granting of grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development under Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) and were to be used to draw up applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Weird regulations are rare".
While regulations often attract criticism in the Member States, many experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its overall development are worthy of praise.
The problem is even more serious, for example, according to experts, the problem of using EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration but which have been imposed by the Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle that it does not always win) is stirring strong emotions among the Czechs.
After six years of fighting the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", and our producers had to replace the name "Tuzemský rum" with the name "Tuzemák" for the name "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to the 19th century.
Only products made from cane sugar alcohol, not beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
The official list of EU registered products includes today world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck cheese or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary biscuits, Pohořelice and Třeboň carp, and Žatec hop (Žatecký chmel).
Pardubický perník and Hořické trubičky are also proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do we plan on running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked out in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can't stand to see the country being plundered over the last 20 years, that thieves are not under lock and key, and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And as I am over forty years old and an independent, nonpartisan, I have no other choice to influence the situation than to run for president or for senator.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set off for the Castle.
Is this how you turn your backs on those who have chosen you?
I always said I'd fight for the castle according to the results of the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
My purpose is not function, it's just a tool to make my vision come true.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we rally at the bar or in front of our TV station, but we also cough up those who try to make a difference.
And the press is also one that is damaging people's reputations and confusing freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was accused of bribing journalists or of being a counselor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have begun the fight for the Castle with the themes of political material and criminal liability as your battle horse and retroactive tax returns in excess of 20 million.
You must change the law to that end.
As president, you don't have that kind of power, and only the Senate as a whole can pass laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen I pushed for tourist guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is the politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly rejected and it delays citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing or a left-wing man ?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right doesn't really matter.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that people are brought together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs, and I am equally impartial against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn 't prove it ?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get close to it.
Some may call this populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without parliamentary support, all you have left is slogans.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will be able to, for example, impose material and criminal liability?
I don't have a choice.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to rally them to my side to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Then they might have to explain why they don't want to.
When there is a strong personality who identifies the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the direct presidential election, which was achieved through public pressure.
I admit, without question, that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person can't make a difference, so I went to a number of personalities and asked them to run for the Senate as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the oil scams.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I'm hesitant.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and most of the people who did did did so voted for a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
The people have elected a Senate that can hardly impose change.
I will, however, fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Are you considering starting your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means to do so.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have 20,000 in my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal possessions at about 60 million.
I have a 25 million dollar plot in Prague, an apartment worth 10 million dollars, another apartment worth 8 million dollars, a collection of artwork worth about 10 million dollars, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million dollars and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million dollars and a few million dollars on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove cars, was a woman's man, and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth $60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not getting much attention.
I'm not obligated to pay for this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the salary I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't afford it, like paying my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I wouldn't run for office.
So you 're going to continue your business to make a living ?
Didn't you say you were going to put your business on hold?
But this has nothing to do with the amount of that compensation.
As I promised, I cut back on my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan saving the Republic.
I'm supposed to be living off something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were a contractor?
I won and I keep earning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd end my business.
You can find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects at MVRDV prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination.
"I find this building funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large nearby company, tells us, "Yes, this building is indeed beautiful".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everybody has the Internet, an iPad, and e-books.
No one is willing to go to one of those shady libraries now, is that right?
Spijkenisse, a dormant town that has nothing to do with the gates of Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
To give some neurons back to the brain, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small, painted concrete miniatures.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
The city officials realized that there was only one way to get back to the statistics - to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam architects' office MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of mindful and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual flegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a laughing smile on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, confused and shouldering, Maas, the shameless, packed his favorite books in order of size to make them a pyramid, and finished his speech backed by activist arguments with a "dear fellow!"
Here's my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the $30 million mountain burst to the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 houses.
In early November, the book mountain was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this dull little village, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunningly ugly town hall, whose white façades suggest that they house a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to Reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book with cheese bell.
While an elevator takes you to the heart of the cliff, the real joys of reading and architecture are opened to you as you step on the floor of the building and discover its topography.
The interior, made entirely of glass, is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant refractors speak the language of municipal public squares.
The atmosphere in the city is perfect.
We're already looking for the public banks, the dogs and the little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere there are books, books and books.
"Usually, the library beams are along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal", explains Willy Maas.
We completely upended the classical spatial configuration and opened up the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain has been skillfully laid out: in the center are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental center and the building's technical center.
A special beauty lies in the black beams of the library, which are sometimes lined with walls, sometimes with balustrades, sometimes with stairwells.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unfamiliar materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse Municipality, in a response to the Standard.
We have found ad hoc agricultural waste in a farmhouse.
In the Netherlands, a millimeter-thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons and then thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time, in such quantities, into plates four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
Nearly 500 metres away, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute most to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model ecological project", Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun shines only briefly inside, even on good weather days.
The thick wooden beams mounted in a wrong direction from the glass facade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting much of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic computer scientist mentioned above, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even described the Boekenberg as "Spijkenisse's finally found soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure helped fill the gaps in the library that had not yet been filled (now 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are pouring out all over the place.
According to architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library".
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows their book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for the decorations".
This is how MVRDV has developed into the master discipline known in professional jargon as "creating an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even if she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role".
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose not to.
Why would you?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, since it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel.
In the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany have difficulty in taking a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as it were defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
The lack of coherent and common policies within the Union is also complicating the situation.
The Germans are therefore facing off on several fronts.
They're expected to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I believe they are still trying to find that role, but they are on the path to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as in France or Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for Germans?
It is willing to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that Germany's foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, and therefore by its exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other great powers, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and its abstention from the UN vote?
Germany has, first of all, important trade opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
This is why Berlin must be careful not to strike public opinion but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, as it is not a one-sided relationship.
But this is at least a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany damage its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain from important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans understand Germany's position perfectly.
I therefore believe that the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States, however, has declared its veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic political scene in the United States.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is far from overwhelmed with enthusiasm about Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany have difficulties in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
It is clear that it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a larger political line and must assert their unique position.
This is what they are doing now in the euro area.
In my view, Germany will in future play a role as a locomotive and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.
That question has always been tricky.
But I think the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that will further their independence.
Does Germany see itself as a major player on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does she still have trouble taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to this, it is always uncomfortable and for obvious reasons the country is still having difficulty playing a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are expressed.
It's not easy for the Germans.
In fact, it's still the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with very different neighbors and opinions, and that's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only decreasing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don't like it, even if they don't like it, even if they don't like it, and they don't appreciate it, it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, D.C., an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America work together to analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, U.S. foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Trade mark protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are world-renowned brands.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark is thus protected in such a way that the company bearing the trade mark's name cannot bring a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd win.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a firm specializing in infringement of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my desk.
Impersonators only need a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies also have legal copyrights, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sportswear.
Pattloch opens a ledger containing the records made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, a designation that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually nothing but counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's case is different: his agents are charged with addressing the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese say "Bang Mingpai", a family name.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
This is the term used for women who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend", Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the reputational damage is enormous".
The financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA, China is the world's third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market, with an annual turnover of EUR 15 billion.
However, it is not easy to remove dubious trademark registrations from the register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports on trials in which the court rejected the complaint because after a long period of time the criticised denomination had become a "true market".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the beach resort, because it would damage his trademark in China.
In this area, sometimes the law of the jungle is the dominant one.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought out the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo acquirer, used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW's logo before the dispute was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to the beaches of Hong Kong and Singapore who had turned the famous crocodile's gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits, however, that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office was reportedly moved from a "work situation of emergency to a normal situation" last year.
The number of untreated opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type were reported to have been closed, a 75% increase from the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain pending at the office.
The cost of doing so
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and it means that China is for the tenth time in a row at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly had 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each registration brought in an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs far more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese beach house.
The Germans were able to obtain a suspension of the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the copycat retained its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"It's our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany", explains Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Speciality in Munich.
The trademark office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichers.
Freudenberg won the following two cases, but the opposing party still struggles to this day.
The Warning Is On
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, time-consuming, and costly".
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs, and the Archives Department has even had to review the records of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing party a "big six-figure euro" to settle the dispute.
"That's how we see what it means to us", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to extend even to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region were to ensure that the unprotected trademarks are exploited.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register Freudenberg's name in Germany for a shoe and leather company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "The vigilance is a must".
Mr Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
They say that it is not enough to rely on international trade mark law, but that foreigners should "register anything that is likely to be protected in China as well", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the final act of its legal drama, the company would have to pay the opposing party licence fees for using its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: footsteps, songs and help
The Imbongi Choir is playing in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans in Swaziland are rejoicing at their arrival.
Here's the story of a connection that goes far beyond a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, women's scarves and men's moccasins hit the ground to find the rhythm.
One, two, three, four.
Then the singers' voices slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor, and soprano - they become angry, enchanted, and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 came from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choir member has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help Yourself
UN AIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
Moreover, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Estjeni have found sponsors in Germany through the association Voices for Africa.
70 of them are in secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo centre.
Imbongi means "story-telling" or "singing praises" in Zulu.
No one in that area can speak the Bantu language fluently, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been playing songs in this foreign language that she brought to Germany and now returns to her native South Africa.
Because a few miles [8,733 km] away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which relies on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people with
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest straw or clay huts and most of them children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as their parents were taken away by HIV.
In Estonia, the disease that is plaguing Swaziland is seen on a smaller scale: the highest HIV infection rate in the world and the lowest life expectancy, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40 percent of the population of Swaziland is infected with the immunodeficiency virus, and deaths in their mid-30s are not uncommon.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village, and the Imbongis saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a high school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was just a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros a year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, an association that has since been working almost professionally to care for Estenian AIDS orphans.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs include HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pubis lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and blenorrhea are common among men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is the cause of at least four out of five reported cases of syphilis in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, fungal candidiasis, blenorrhagia, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The HIV prevalence rate among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, but about 20% of new HIV infections are found in this group.
Young people have a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than other groups of the population.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the rate of infection?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years, from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been declining.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abcesses in the genitals, urinary pain, loss of whites, lower abdominal pain, and the appearance of bumps and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and are therefore hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don't protect you 100%.
The reason is that sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who frequently changes sex partners undergo regular screening.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late seizures can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, donations, but above all the funds raised by the choir members through their voices throughout Germany, the funds are being accumulated.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estjeni", says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also makes sure that orphans are well-placed, such as in the home of their grandmother.
The Gogos, as the old women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them house up to 14 orphans, provide shelter for them, and ensure that they arrive at school on time each day in their uniforms.
The orphan who is left alone is welcomed into a safe place, at the home of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa has set up a sewing school and has allowed the construction of two chicken farms. With the help of the US health organization PSI, the association has organized HIV testing for many residents.
This is not a coincidence, because even though the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
"AIDS is a taboo", explains Annette Lennartz, "because it is a sexual issue".
It's pretty curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These state-sanctioned practices, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
"There are condoms on every street corner", adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh".
To encourage cultural exchange, Imbongi's choirs go on trips together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the Black Continent's tip are still familiar with from apartheid times.
The bus full of white people singing in African language is a sign of gratitude, so that it not only brings good humor and joy, but sometimes also tears from some fearful border guards.
The bus still takes them to Estjeni, where the choir members visit their pupils.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Estjeni, you'll find light", people say there.
And after a flight of 8,733 kilometers back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who are kicking their feet in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although the planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as three studies published Thursday in the journal Science explain.
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of an ice sheet in the region of the planet permanently submerged in shadow.
This covering would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters, up to 20 meters.
The water probably came from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one is linking the discovery of water to the hypothesis that life exists on the planet, explains Messenger's chief scientist, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help us understand how water and other vital elements for life came to be in other parts of the solar system.
Unseen by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and tiny robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like tiny interstices through which we observe infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets in our solar system, along with the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union's new definition of the term.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink dots, the most difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the universe's birth chamber.
The Spitzer Telescope discovered this region of star formation, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope has photographed the flickering brightness of a dying star.
The donut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star throws out when it dies.
In the massive nebula Trifide, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer Telescope has photographed this galactic birth chamber.
The Pleiades, also called the "seven sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
But the telescope is more about colour.
In this infrared image, the helix nebula looks directly at the viewer like a red eye.
It's 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography allows for a spectacular shade.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble Telescope is that of the Milky Way.
Depending on the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifidus comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three tracks of dust divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginning of a cosmic carambold in the constellation Serpenturus: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are jumping into each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cephas.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is composed of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than normal domestic dust.
This photo was made from optical and x-ray images taken by different telescopes.
You can see the black hole circle that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed this group of galaxies for NASA, which it called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also continuously create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy of bright rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the big bang, when the universe was largely made up of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown in size and have allowed us to see farther into the universe.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, has a huge stomach, and the mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter is still about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its peculiarity lies in its great ability to collect light.
Despite its relatively small diameter, this capacity is close to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe to search for signals from extraterrestrials using the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone with a computer can help with the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) by using the computing power of their machine.
View from the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to be an impressive 42 meters in size, and it will be made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors, each 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which uses the Subaru and IRTF telescopes to observe the sky.
A new giant telescope is also expected to be built on Mauna Kea, and its mirror will be 30 meters in diameter.
This illustration is admirable.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mostly habitable ones.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will be used to find the light that was projected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe that the south pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data has been indicating ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day, and live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the ages of the Bible's patriarchs.
There's even a longevity museum.
A survey of a country where people are still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to the ages of the Bible's patriarchs.
There's even a longevity museum.
A survey of a country where people are still relatively young at 97.
The journey through the Talysh mountains is a romantic one.
The bus, which turns from many corners of the road, roams along forested hills, rivers, and small farms.
Everything is green and fertile, you'd almost think you were in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Talysh, a Caucasian ethnic group, live. Little is known about them except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and live a very long life.
I'm going to get a new one.
The small town is full of overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that doesn't match the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
European tourists are scarce here, and the journey from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, is far too arduous.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, since the road has only one road.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision contest, and next year the festival of the world's oldest people will be held here", says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
There you can see the life of about eight dozen Talyshs in the area who are over 100 years old.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having another child at 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who is said to have lived to be 168.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when you think that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region and died in 1973", says Fatulayeva.
The man would have been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he would have conceived another daughter.
Would Şirali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the old man in Central Asia.
"Strangely elderly people also live in parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley of Pakistan", explains Scholz, "and in Sardinia there are men who live incredibly old".
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because there are no documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of butter
However, the fact is that the people of the Lerik area often reach a age that is worthy of the Bible's patriarchs.
Today, 20 people are over 100.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tour guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
But Fatulayeva, the museum's director, thinks it's about food.
However, it does not seem plausible from a nutritional standpoint that high-calorie meals in the Talysh, who like meat, bread, and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of butter every day, are healthy.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth?
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the area.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a cockroach, beating its contents tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have grown up for a long time.
Two little kids are also creeping around the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armored glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long black blonde beards that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost my hair and it kept its color.
"I have never used shampoo", Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate what came from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life, I've never bought a single piece of food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst times were after World War II.
But things improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda is astonishing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the figure of the father of the nation, a man who ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manats (about the same amount as the euro) to ensure a good standard of living in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-gray son is right: "The elderly are highly respected in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for, and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep fracture in the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy with words full of emotion.
We need to make the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God", he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but also especially to Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and lay people.
For all the members of the opposition are confused and desperately disunited.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not know exactly what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California, U.S.A., wants to do.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hastily drafted by the 100-member, mostly Muslim assembly during a 15-hour night shift are indeed somewhat disturbing.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal margin of manoeuvre to enforce a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, this is reminiscent of a newly introduced article stating that, for all matters relating to Sharia law, al-Azhar University must be consulted.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative body, which would in fact result in the judicial branch being placed under the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the dictator fell, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The draft also says that the state must "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of filmmaking and literature.
Clearly, it would be simply censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
The wording that "offending people" is forbidden is equally questionable.
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft which Morsi is putting to the vote and which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum among the Egyptians "very soon".
"The revolution was born again"
Opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual accord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to overthrow Sharia law before it comes into force.
"The revolution is born again and we will win", says Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the garbage of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of trying to foment a "coup against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoning", said Khaled Ali, an Egyptian politician and member of the opposition, according to Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they will not monitor the referendum, which would result in its annulment.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for their part, called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precaution but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was being held outside Cairo University.
The women and Salafists who were in large numbers were shouting: "The people want to obey God's law".
"Purify our country!" they asked Morsi, saying "the Qur'an [was] their constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that the opposition to the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud.
They say it's time to let the people decide by the ballot what direction the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process which should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood in prison and in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their worldview but because he considered human rights indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and jailed.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution", he regretted in his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are a flagrant violation of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is effectively stripping him of all his powers", Saeda lamented.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who view the battle between the different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could be worth it.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You give birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control".
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret to the country's success be linked to the local appetite for a highly odorful fish?
Have some advanced cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of wet, dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most prized dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The snow is snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and the smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
Rakfisk is made up of salted trout that is fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - and can last up to a year.
When it gets dark and cold, Norwegians gather in large numbers to attend a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this amazing culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit", explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival's management.
People around us swallow small pieces of fish and pour a large amount of liquor.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk", adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, that's not bad - it's like sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, and before the invention of the refrigerator, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, the fish, once well fermented, came out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - was eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mostly to emigrate to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 percent are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered an important, vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 euros each.
Norway is not often mentioned in international news, which is not to its displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about the murder, they're talking about "the July 22 incident".
Norwegians find it hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own could have committed such a savage act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has been rich because of its oil and gas industry, one of the world's largest.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success", explains our waitress, Anna, with blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in her hand.
We are, as you say, prudent people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out of the window, in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its stock market tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"Not to mention rakfisk", she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and I line up to buy food - I've had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger with momentum, a real discovery, is great.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or maybe the most smelly of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
You'd think you were in the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, maybe because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is having a tough start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, BBC's Will Grant is interested in the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic is normally high, a security barrier has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key roads in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent the protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scar to become the new president at the head of the nation.
He's got a complicated task ahead of him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, thanks to outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already killed about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was governor of Mexico.
A very populous and sprawling state that encircles the capital, and in its favorite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A straight man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is recorded in the memory of all.
The local authorities attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plaques bearing his name hang outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change", said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and member of Pena Nieto's PRI party.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for the real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, there are many expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He's a man of integrity, very committed, with a great vision of the country.
He's a great statesman and, above all, he's a good listener.
However, this is not always the view of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more pronounced.
Hidden beneath the highway bridges, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to rescue the drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly severe.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years have been found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place infamous for the number of innocent women killed there.
Pena Nieto's critics say at best he has failed to address the issue of murders of women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a typical concrete house in this decayed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed to me that her body had been washed", says Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the rigidity of the corpse had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana is dressed on the wall, next to a cross with the word "Justice".
However, that was exactly what the family was refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old woman who was a troublemaker, a weeping woman.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions", she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarves on Saturday, she will be carrying a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make it a priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as he was as good as he was when he was governor", said Olvera, a congressman in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to disprove claims of abuse that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered while in custody.
The trial is about Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's seizure was done under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the largest leak of classified information in the history of the U.S. military -- missed many occasions to complain about the mistreatment he claims he suffered during his military detention.
During a counter-interrogation with Manning during a preliminary hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter-interrogation -- during a hearing, the defense filed a motion to dismiss Manning's case on the grounds that the seizure was done under very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning expressed his desire to commit suicide while in custody.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were later published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms the officers had filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at the Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum-security prison confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment provided by his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in prison was "very professional" overall.
The forms do not mention any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns orally about certain problems and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the problems mentioned.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn't mean I hadn't raised problems", Manning said.
Military Judge Colonel Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a January 2011 interview with the Special Commission that met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know I was fine, and I wanted this status to be removed... so that I could enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine Corps Military Prison at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide while in Kuwait and once passed out from the heat.
He added that not being told what was coming to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was confined to Camp Arafjon, to this cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least nine hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes, and glasses.
He tried to stay on the move, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also explained that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning questions about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself during the call.
During the judge's questioning on Friday, Manning said he had inferred from his guard's order that he should drop his blanket that could have hidden his nudity, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he attempted to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the rubber on his slippers or his tongs to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences while in custody and will significantly reduce his sentence if he is found guilty in a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty to lesser offences and fighting for the release of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were warranted.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the terms of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all the accused are caught, he faces criminal custody for life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
The signs indicated two roads: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexican") and the other for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing which line to take.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, just like my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italians".
Then I became "Mexican-American".
But here, it was Mexico.
And on the earth that my grandfather was born, there's no need for special qualifications or a bond.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in one or the other.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed to the "Foreigners" queue.
I was thinking about that time of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite topics are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are complicated and bitter.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half their territory in writing at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.
So as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite -- complaints about how the Americans are undermining their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason why there are so many Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, someone, maybe a parent or grandparent, didn't find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And most of the time, this person was a typical profile -- dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream right now, that we went to good schools and we have good situations, we should never lose sight of the fact that we're living the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We're giving it to the United States.
We also know that some of the Mexican elite in the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they weave us as if we were inferior and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
To them, our existence is a failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they never would have left.
And we wouldn't be stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexican-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels like she belongs to two countries.
And many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they belong to any country.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love the music of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we're not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we're considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little bit more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as wealth ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a beautiful country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course I do.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the widespread inequality of wages, corruption, and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to do this on your own, amigos.
That's not a bad thing.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want to be forgiven for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
I'm not going to.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist about who started, dozens of buildings have been razed to the ground; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full flux.
The Arab Spring has blown everything apart, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Maybe their struggle will get a little more intense.
Yet there is every reason to believe that it could help them out of this deadly stalemate.
A war that makes no losers and no winners
At first glance, it may seem difficult to be optimistic.
Even though the ceasefire agreed on November 21st remains in place, this week's fighting has strengthened the support for force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast that they forced the Israelis to surrender, even though Gaza has suffered a blow.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed back the 1.7 million people of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the rest of Palestine now in the hands of its rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may think that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a booming regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken action for Hamas; so has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hamas members cheer and say the rising Islamist is curving around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah militia dominates, through Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can topple Bashar El Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more easily exposed to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that cannot be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas has been re-packaged.
The Iron Dome missile interception system proved effective and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence.
But most importantly, Israel has prospered, especially under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who completely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, notably by the separation barrier that encircles the West Bank, the main part of what could be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more militant party led by leader Avigdor Lieberman as the January 22 election approaches, has the good side.
Why would you give these Palestinian bastards a state?
If they were in charge of the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they get out of the head.
Maybe the hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring may change the game.
Even though the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defense budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to settle their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is a good omen -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories - much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to blow up Hamas will have a diplomatic reward.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains that of the reasonable people on both sides, and of most of the outside world and of this newspaper: two states, with a territorial cede by Israel in return for security.
One small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will give the outside world an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in line with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of foreign countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal for a pseudo-state at the UN.
Mr Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
New laws for neutral cigarette packages come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packets which are all identical, regardless of the mark
This law, which came into force in Australia, is the first of its kind in the world, and the logos and colors have been replaced with dark olive green and horrifying pictures of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by their parents smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small letters on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regimen in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating all glamorous depictions.
Studies have shown that if people haven't started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance they'll never start.
"Even at a very young age, children understand the message of tobacco manufacturers through their brand image", said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a logo crown with a princess".
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and the changes have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pressured against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said this would revive black market trade, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be harmful consequences from this legislation", said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had given them a boost in activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said that demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia's High Court.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
We're doing good business.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the target population.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship, and the requirement for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by local businesses and websites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the place to go", said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some lambda citizens in favor of brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is just a citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video, or is this a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation in force rather than marketing.
The industry has even paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - countries that have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said that the government had been in discussions with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning pictures on packaging compulsory in 2001.
These warnings are now being given in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Tighter laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain indifferent to these photos.
I'm not bothered by the pictures.
I don't know them.
"You take a cigarette and you pack it", said Victor El Hage when buying a package with a picture of a mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna get arrested is because of my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacco shop" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packages on the outlets.
"I used to take an hour to unload a package, now it takes four hours", Yu said.
"The government had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that's fine, we stop and put the key under the door", he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a world that is constantly connected, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had enough time to think about the subject of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines, and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development are praising boredom.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
It forces the brain to take interesting pathways, even to nurture creativity.
And because most of us are constantly in front of different types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
- Yes, I did.
And no, I did not.
But I'll be back.
First, like many people, I thought boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Trouble goes back a long way", he said.
The walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there's the definition we give boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and debated in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and presenting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to do something but failing to get into a satisfying activity".
He says that what distinguishes boredom from apathy is that the person is not doing a task even though they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, coupled with a dull mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be linked, bored people tend to think the problem is from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem is from them.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened on tape to the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard from the next room the loudest sound of a TV show that had no relevance, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who listened to the TV at a low sound level said they got bored more than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or busy task, distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like watching objects on a string assembly line, music can help you not get bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that when you twitch or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay still", said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - my late flight, a speaker with a monocorded voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Predisposition to Boredom Scale" in the 1980's.
The scale includes statements like, "Many of the tasks I do are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all".
Using this scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and need a variety of stimulations.
But teenagers are usually quick to get bloated.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It found that 32 percent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
But 3 percent of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its peak", especially because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
Let me just say, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead to people taking absurd physical risks, betting, or abusing certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
But many philosophers and writers have pointed to a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain has found to tell you that you should do something else", said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what the best thing to do is.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he will not get bored, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or himself, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another", he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, but he gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant upheavals that are being generated by activities and technology is the goal we should be striving towards.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens a keen, frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense", he said.
He says what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated", he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops".
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old college student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was summoned to appear for possession of drugs and other material used for his consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date for appearance.
"We are treated like criminals", said Mr Orozco.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of low-drug cases depends more on the location than the law.
Here and in Washington State, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of marijuana-related offenses have been settled without a trial.
Police have stopped charging adults 21 and older for minor marijuana possession as the law will go into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado counties have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to prosecute marijuana owners.
Meanwhile, several cities from the Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains are currently voting to block the opening of state-licensed marijuana stores in their neighborhoods.
"Things are changing so fast that I don't know what the future holds", said Daniel J. Oates, the head of Aurora, Denver's eastern police department.
The Washington State regulators also ask a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, authorising production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that whether we like it or not, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first in terms of medical use and now in terms of personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and it's a good indicator", said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves", he said.
Washington's law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the permitting system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis retail stores within a 30-km radius of a school, park, playground or daycare center.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently formed Cannabis Legalization Center, a research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates emailed his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people 21 years of age and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging people with this type of crime "with immediate effect".
Chief Oates said the police would enforce the new court rulings governing the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that they would continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, "district attorney" Ken Buck embodies a more rigorous view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many are on other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those who have committed a crime that was a recognized offence at the time of the events", said Mr Buck.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer bring adults in for possession of restricted amounts.
The county public service representative, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to immediately classify all marijuana possession cases.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time on continuing to enforce the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and governmental framework appropriate to personal marijuana use is not an easy task.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with public service officials, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they have a hard time accepting it as legal", he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the verge of becoming a case-law for legalizing drugs.
As state advocates and officials plan a new frontier of legal sales, they are anxiously awaiting directives from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will back down.
Despite some media arrests of medical marijuana patients and drug dealers, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police will likely not slam their doors to seize small pockets of drugs, there is a good chance that they are opposed to licensed retailers selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have waited for the federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local authorities approved moratoriums on the opening of new marijuana shops, even if it was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a six-month moratorium, and it's expected to impose that ban next week.
"We don't want to end up in a situation where a permit is given to someone and then we find ourselves facing a federal problem", said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're more interested in community voting than state voting.
There are many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and expelled from Oxford because I was a "Tory".
It's not just students today who are being attacked for their opinions.
For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what I considered a prominent place of learning, a kind of modern Greek amphitheater that stimulated the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university because I objected to the fact that undergraduates had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with a flattering face that I had left after being forced to drink in cracked cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I had been bullied and attacked constantly.
Not because of my rather outlandish name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why bring it up today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of right-wing middle school students are suffering the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalised hatred of Tory students at Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College Student Room (CSA) said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative on the University's Equal Opportunity Committee so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which dealt with student politics and depicted the "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
Among the items were student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who was driving in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and moving around with a chrome-plated head cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated like scapegoats for the implementation of higher tuition fees".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a Corpus Christi history student who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the UUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate and to the well-being of members", she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first few weeks at Oxford.
I joined in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and paralyzed by shyness.
The Conservative Party's hatred was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree because of the cut in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was to come.
I found out that the teachers not only took part in the sarcasm of Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy of child strikers, privatization and government opposition to the anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa were engraved in the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was subjected to was a translation into English of 18th-century French texts, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustule-faced face, was easily upset.
"Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
I was burning with tears.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time - if you're not too busy making friends", he said in a harsh tone.
I went back to my room, uncomfortable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then I felt a slight bump on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student named James, who applied to OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said, gently.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is being targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be even harder for you.
Most Tory youths claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This ploy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken up the chorus.
I was a pervert, you dirty bitch.
"How do Tories make love?" one of them asked.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt like a homosexual before the liberal legislation of the '60s.
Could I have lived a normal life only in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and denied my views?
The next three years would be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was hardly ever there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I started taking the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded family and friends in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a dreamy-bells town.
Even my Communist friends had impeccable manners.
He was tearful.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also a Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a workshop the following week, when another history professor suggested most seriously in the world that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Inwardly disgusted, I admitted that my parents were brainwashed and called them "old fools".
The rest was short-lived.
My father was the one who knocked the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At the time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I was stuck in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a wet, crying chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such bullying in a school setting.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-end fashion models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he declared with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the proud point of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
The first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, features an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino presents his personal memories as the trophies of his social upbringing: from the modest stylist of the northern Italian city of Voghera to the idol of the international jet set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful rug like some pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960's and 1970's, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and a generous and elegant host.
"We all loved being invited to his Gstaad cottage", says "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, who was a close friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
Argentine model Valeria Mazza also remembered the stylist's charisma.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Square in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His spirit was seen and felt in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go out of fashion, because its creations are works of art", she concludes.
The line of nobility
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He loves the people who are high and with the highest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous, 60-meter-wide podium that offers the opportunity to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must scroll down the podium to admire a dream "public" wearing Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "The Note", or a wool and fur coat belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
Among these models are Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the seamstress in 2006
Many of his clients say Valentino's first clothes are like first love, "unforgettable".
I remember that perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "jelly" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-72 collection.
"It's a gift he gave me", said Naty Abascal, one of the seamstress's muses.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he elevates our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they're bright and they brighten my face.
The proportions are perfect.
Neither can Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of being old enough to wear one of her evening gowns...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990's.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Ligne.
It was a red evening gown, with a flying skirt, a draped buster and a drop-off collar.
"It was a dream come true", said the widow of Rodrigue of Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, obsessed with timelessness", explains the Italian aristocrat who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the seamstress' evening gowns with "great care, because a evening gown is not only a dress, it is also the whole collection of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 ragas (the seamstress is called her seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with pearl incrustations, twelve different kinds of laces, and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to Suzy Menkes, the top authority in the news, this dress represents a historic event in late-20th-century high fashion, "the return of high-end customers".
For years, obsessed with the "wisdom" of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative.
Knight of the Grand Cross (the highest honour in Italy), Knight of the Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has as many honours as any husband of his clients.
"I always admired her refinement, calmness, neatness, and perfection", admits D. Arenberg.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my best friends.
"He was flawless, years have no effect on him".
If it's a princess who says it...
The hardest job in the world: human mules in Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano-bearers risk their lives and health carrying 70 kilograms of sulfur through steep stone paths.
There are people who work for hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfuric gas from the earth's interior solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large, weighing about 70 kilograms of sulfur, he places them in two bamboo baskets and carries them on his shoulders along the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2,386 meters, but weary climbers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle's pace, keeping their feet in balance and measuring them so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell deadly in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur extracted.
Once up there, they make their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little below at 1,850 meters.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, as it were, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (€5 cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since it is very common in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Because we carry about 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes three hours and ends up exhausted, but that allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it may seem a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the fields.
"The income of miners is very high here, where coffee harvesting is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", says the carrier who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to her family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, constant coughing, and eyes irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on Kawah Ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, constant coughing, and her eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'll work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
This friendly, intelligent young man, who is plagued by life, may be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy woodworking pattern with other carriers, rising every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur never ceases to gush at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the dark.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater, shining with a small lamp attached to his headset, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanised the extraction of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to the self-employed and weight-paid carriers.
They also do not receive a penny of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) in camera surcharge, in addition to the 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) that the park guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for animals, not humans", protested 42-year-old Madrusin, a fat-carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for 30 years since he left school.
He can weigh up to 110 pounds and says he will work "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons, ages 10 to 18.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of serious illnesses... in addition to their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only carry 50 kilos.
Each day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away, through a goat trail filled with weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life", Unainik says, opening his mouth wide, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of five children, a 30-year-old, also works as a sulphur ship.
Time passes, but the continuing misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the one done by the human mules of the Kawah Ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the lack of children on their careers, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must grow".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words came from a commercial for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread like a powder keg on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polyp in the drawer" to mock the birth rate in Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to bring attention to the issue in a fun way through this ad.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to help people fulfill "their national duty".
It's only for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and entertaining.
This is the main problem in this country.
We're the worst births in the world, so we felt it was a topic we needed to address.
We knew the government had tried a number of things like throwing pheromone perfumes or throwing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves, what could be more creative about solving this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take this so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on politics to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, which is considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family creation", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to counteract population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that show a barely disguised xenophobia towards new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of lowering wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons the Singaporean party had its worst electoral results since independence last year.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem by setting up higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid building many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and are very successful in selling them.
However, authorities are concerned that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular in that they are built much faster than larger homes.
For that reason, it's much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously given sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the central financial district would seem to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, and education is expensive, so people put it off", says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time", says another young man in his early 20's.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as reasons why they are unable to have children.
So while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans themselves have the final say.
What's private offline is private online.
Confidentiality
According to the Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary, this is the quality of private life or "the area of private life that we can protect from intrusion".
What is private property for those under 16?
How can we apply this definition in our daily lives and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers of posting events online that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged 10 to 15, who were frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post", says Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of the term privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone", he says.
I post some cool pictures or games on FB.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I'm not going to share one of my pictures or anyone else who would be stupid", he says.
The boy admits that it is wrong to post pornographic pictures, naked people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends on FB and nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are family.
Her mother's part of it. She knows the password to one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them", he adds.
"Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends, fast", he says.
He says he would never accept a request from a stranger.
He will not trust anyone who recommends a stranger.
José, 14, is a different case.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his friends list.
"I don't care because we have something in common, music for example", he says.
The boy said no one had asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply delete them from my account", he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we now know as cyberbullying are no stranger to the young boy.
A relative of one of my friends was racked on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was", he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it on as a private profile".
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post pictures of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I was angry or upset.
"Even though I know it's cyberbullying", he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and a licensed teacher in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to seek information but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed", she says.
The academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in education from Yale University and is the author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are themselves, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them here, while we are learning ourselves", she says.
He adds that the subject is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is or is not to be disclosed, published or said at an age when they are not mature enough to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is to use questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is useless", she says.
Then, list a few examples: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like a friend you posted?
Do you know what other people are saying about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any given moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they should act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, and it must be the same on social media", she says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education advisor, says that it is vital that parents read the terms and conditions of social media carefully.
By understanding each of these terms, they will have a solid foundation for discussing with their children the implications of opening an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published", he says.
Guardia says it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNSUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The sixth Presidency Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven delegates present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the summit was closed, then claimed that it would be posted from time to time on the Peruvian government website.
When they were asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollante Humala in brief press releases.
The access of journalists to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the silent video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was aired in the press room.
The few reports among journalists were those given by press officers from some of the governments of the United Nations that were present at the meeting, except for the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency emailed the media with the summit's "final statement", but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document concluding the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the 3rd South American Arab Summit (SAAS) and, on this occasion, although press urged it, it did not publish the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
The official website of ASPA confirms that the document was published last March.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities tried to set up secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice which decided on a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the pleas of both parties in the Lima trial against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing today before this international court", President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been and will continue to be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of international disputes, treaties and courts", added President Piñera, shaking President Humala's hand, holding the flags of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact, which had agreed to submit to the decisions of the International Court of Justice, following a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from the UN since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that action lines for 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total investment of 17 million dollars.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the United Nations would make "important strides to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of residence permit agreements".
He said that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organised crime, actions for better access to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not be a triumphal matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to foresee a better future for our people", concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 landmark projects that improve connectivity in South America, particularly in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits", the Peruvian president said in a speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects were in Peru and were located on the cross-sectional axes of Peru's territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region, integrated and in good relations with its neighbours, was another theme discussed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before the regional meeting began that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico City next Saturday to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a decision of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", said President Santos.
"We will review all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will require a discussion with that country", he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", added President Santos.
President Santos and President Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to witness the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, the summit will see the EU's Defence Ministers meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen defence dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the UN, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru shall hold the provisional presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship", says Rafael Correa.
President Rafael Correa of Ecuador said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should set an example for Europe".
President Correa, who attended the VI Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, told Peruvian state television TV that Europeans "had killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they were almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the South American citizenship project encouraged by the member countries of the United Nations.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case for the Andean Community members, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make a thing of the past", he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who are listening to us never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding", he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret his decision, as he did not betray his own principles, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for requiring him to be interrogated in his country over an alleged sexual offence while "Swedish law itself allows videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious", said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health may deteriorate by being confined to a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"It affects everyone's health", he concludes.
Correa reports that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the granting of a safe passage that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he points out that he has been in talks in London to find a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been continuous discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings in different European courts", he said.
And he thinks "if Britain gives the exemption tomorrow, it'll be over".
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows, and as it has done in other cases, interviewed Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or interviewed him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took this opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of press freedom and he said what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil or perverse politicians but the bad journalists who pay for greed, blackmail and extortion", he said.
He welcomed the fact that it was not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than pushing for his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "must stand firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it would destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty, "perfectly relevant".
At this time, this judgment is not being upheld.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We must solve them as a whole to get past them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said that it was "beneficial for Latin America to bring international cases if both countries agreed to accept a judgment as firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of running for a third consecutive term in the future presidential election in Ecuador, he said he saw this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primary, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the guarantor of this eventual victory but we must accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president and I will retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I'll lose too.
"It's my decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a decline in the health status of President Chávez", he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today attended the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now the result of late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed to have HIV.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head", he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and started to inquire about it and his diligence was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless".
Back then, having AIDS was death.
Today, it is possible to survive the syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, many people, unaware of their illness, still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "deleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the world's AIDS outbreak, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG HIV unit, referring to the fact that this information was validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system impairment patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a CD4 rate of 500.
Simply put, this means that for someone diagnosed with HIV at age 25, "as long as they remain under control, they can live without problems for up to 75 years", the scientist said.
To put this progress into context, it is important to note that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico the number of people who died from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died by May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral medicines has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we've never run out of medicines, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact that "nine out of ten patients arrive with an opportunistic infection, and the only way to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make early diagnoses and to do so, mass screening tests must be offered to all who request it".
Experts and members of the Jalisco State AIDS Prevention Council (Coesida) agree with his proposal, as do patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to take his screening test in a private laboratory simply because a friend had done so and that, despite his young age, he was already AIDS-positive and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better I blow myself up three times a week", they say, "not my case".
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
So far, all his parents know is that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person", says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help those who are afraid today, through his testimony, during the World AIDS Day march.
If they get tested, if they take risks, the sooner they know if they're HIV positive and the better, and if they've already been diagnosed, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the average citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest part is prevention.
"We have actually increased condom distribution in all places, before we were given one or two condoms, now we are given packages of one hundred condoms, which is fine, but as a result, some people still do not have access to condoms", he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
The question, "What are you going to do about it?" asked with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, the journalist assures.
He proposed a reorientation of this inefficient distribution; that condoms should not only be sold at the counter but also in the distributors of public toilets and in the places where young people go.
This is not about promoting promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked if there would be a condom distribution in his administration.
"That's not how sex works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active", he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the fourth largest state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and the 13th largest in the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are from the bloodstream and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for every recorded case, there are four or five people who are unaware of it.
A ruling upheld on appeal by a US court ignores the restructuring of Vitro's debt agreed through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
So it seems that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the star-studded country, in contrast to international agreements.
In practical terms, the blow to the judgment given on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the leading glassmaker in Mexico to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on three grounds of inconsistency.
First, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must register under the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, affirms that the main proceedings are the formal bankruptcy of Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Second, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies.
Furthermore, what is certain is that, since the subsidiaries' votes remained, in any case Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the US courts, namely the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have won the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, which has affected the costs of the country.
The Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the Treaty.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require review of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing Vitro's proceedings under the commercial bankruptcy law, stating that this freed him from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It also notes that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-way traffic: they knock Vitro out and they knock the country out.
The balance sheet
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's unions against the company's former boss, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Aircraft Pilots' Union Association already ran into problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority consistently denied providing information to the Attorney General of the Republic about an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw 198 million pesos from the IXE bank's F/589 trust on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds were reportedly used to buy shares in the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're besieging the Dragon Mart.
A group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society gathered at the end of the week in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean and approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the Great Wall country, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the South-East area to oppose the monumental project, which is partly located on protected areas and represents the greatest threat to industry.
The ACTA is dead
The government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Commercial Agreement Against Counterfeiting, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, a topic that is already in the past.
As everyone knows, it was good that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex for the long term
In order to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, home developer Homex has entered the stock market for 500 million pesos.
This issue of securities is the first of four issues for which they offer interest payments every 28 days.
The birth of Competival
A new consortium, formed by the leading IT companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, competival, has just been formed, with the aim of the Central and South American clustering software services market.
The investment in this area exceeds 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball world-trotting "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the field and, thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the history of local basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage sent him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a minor league player, national basketball player, manager and head of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s", recalls Reyes during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life".
Reyes doesn't overdo it when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia reminiscent of his unusual itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he cherishes most are those that remind him of his time as a player with the Vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as the team's co-manager or manager.
"These were my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I was lucky enough to be in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967 onwards, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
This has been a satisfying time for many years, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team", says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was a former head coach at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, telling me, "I have a tough player for you, he's six feet tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how to start with Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse to me, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had let Bayamon win one championship, Gausse would help us try and win another.
He was happy with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only from a distance since in 1988 he was already the main manitou of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's responsibilities in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic Games in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian referee hadn't let us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only made up of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup of 90 due to a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy in the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the imposture of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt about it, it's Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has ever dominated at this level as Piculín has.
And that's without taking into account his track record in the various leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work Leo Arill does when I'm young.
What do you think is your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have liked to have put in place, like the regionalisation of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when that is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
I usually listen to music, watch YouTube clips from my time, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
The death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world-famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a ruthless, fearful, manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night from complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and its sequels, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his press officer, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate, and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Larry Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made a name for himself on television as a regular character in the NBC series "Jinny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In this one, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and took her home.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Her film roles include critically acclaimed roles in The Band, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman became his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to sustain suspense around an emotional episode in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars in bets.
This, among other things, led to the series reaching a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens, making "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. had gotten her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't leave town, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable but charismatic man: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to intern his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take to be an epitaph for J.R"., Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Here's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman this Friday as a "great man, both on the small screen and in life".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas episode aired a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The filming of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is currently in production, the channel said.
So far, neither Warner nor TNT have commented on how Hagman's death will be included in the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who rose to fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the New York theater stage in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he published his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I have not written anything in this book that could hurt or affect anyone in any way", he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I go with them when they come for surgery and afterwards", he said in 1996.
I try to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it won't be easy for a while, but it'll be okay".
He was also an anti-tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A Course on "The End of the World" Just Began
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion teacher Stuart Charmé decided to teach a class on the end of the world, he knew he was throwing a deadlock: the end of the "great count" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many refer to as evidence of the impending end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the months that followed: the catastrophic Sandy hurricane, a tax slump that some have dubbed "the debt Armageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists thought the apocalypse would unfold.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever had", Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If you look at what's happening in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we have to remember that bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only professor to teach "the end of the world" classes this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time", he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to real-life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to teach a course, simply titled "The End of the World".
"We're adding '2012' to give the opportunity to teach the class again, in case the world doesn't disappear", said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world", Restall said.
The classes have proved quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours", Restall said of his high school class of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I am fascinated by what people can do to comfort themselves", says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort, or no comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a course teaching this subject", he said.
I appreciate that.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone one professor, told us to believe in the end date of December 21.
"Our first project was on Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it", says 21-year-old Julie zegle, a senior student at Temple from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, but it is just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I do admit that there is an anxiety about the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back centuries, that makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a surge of speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it", he says.
It is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches classes in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that classes were being taught here about "the end of the world".
"The Philippines is not involved in the end of the world", he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years there have been many supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us they were thinking of going to "the end of the world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together", commented 20-year-old communication student Samira Ford.
