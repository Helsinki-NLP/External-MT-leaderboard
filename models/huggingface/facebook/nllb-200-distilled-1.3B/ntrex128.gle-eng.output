British AMs are concerned about the appearance of beds
There is a disagreement among some MPs before the proposal that its title should be changed to MWP (Member of the British Parliament).
The delegation was prompted by plans to change the name of the assembly to the British Parliament of Belgium.
The AMs are believed by people across the political spectrum to be a fool's errand.
AM once told the Labour Party that his group was concerned that he would rhyme with Twp and Pwp"
Note for readers from outside Wales: twp means fool and pwp means fool in Welsh.
AM told Plaid Cymru that the group as a whole was neither happy nor satisfied, and alternative recommendations have been made.
A person with the Conservative Party said that their groups were divided about the name change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and Muppet in English.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "It is of course for the Members themselves to make the final decision on any rapporteur under the name to be given to Assembly Members".
The British Assembly of Wales was given the power in The Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
The Commission published the results of a public consultation in June on the proposals which had received broad support for the designation of the assembly as the Parliament of Great Britain.
The Commission's choice of the title of the NAMs was the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.
The AMAs are apparently proposing alternatives, but the challenge of reaching an opinion could be a heartbreaker for the Chief Executive Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to table a draft of the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation under the reforms shall include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of MAs and on the design of the committee system.
The MFIs will have the final vote on the title when they discuss the legislation.
Today is the day for the Macedonian people to vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on the right to change the name of the country to Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was agreed as part of an attempt to resolve a long-standing border dispute with Greece, which also includes a province called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and has made successive objections to its application for EU and ECAT membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid if EU and ECAT membership is to be accepted.
St. Martin's Clock comes to a halt and Harlem Chapel comes to a halt
"Historically, the elders I spoke to say that there were bears and churches around every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Neither of those exist today".
He said it was understandable that the bear was leaving.
"People go out in different ways" today, he said.
"The bars are no longer in the public seating rooms as people go on a regular basis".
For the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders wish, "and they will just be back where they started sooner or later".
Churches could be replaced by apartment buildings, and they are full of people who do not help the rubbish in the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be fair-skinned", he said, "and so they will accelerate the day when these churches are completely closed because most of the people who move into these apartments are unlikely to be members of these churches".
Both chapels were built by white communities before Harlem became a blue-collar metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The light-skinned Modish population moved out in the 1930s.
The building was named after a blue-haired people who worshipped nearby.
St. Martin's was taken over by a blue-collar community under the auspices of John Howard Johnson, who led a protest against 125th Street retailers on a major shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the recruitment or promotion of blue-collar people.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but the parishioners commissioned Father Johnson to print it when they planned reconstruction plans.
The record was baptized by the Hon. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, who was the first to baptize the composer's work.
The expert who performed the record in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "a historical musical instrument that could not be found to match".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that the world's first recording of a blue-eyed musician, Dionisio A. Lind, was moved to the Riverside Church's grandstand 18 years ago.
Lord Merriweather said that St. Martin's had not got him a representative.
The architects and contractors who have been seen at St. Martin's over the past few months have been a complex situation, with some being brought in by the village church leaders, and others by the bishopric.
The bishop - the governing body of the parish itself - wrote to the diocese in July about his concerns that the diocese would look to pass on the costs to the bishop, although the bishop was not involved in hiring the priests and contractors who were sent in by the diocese.
Some in the parish community complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the church.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while diving in front of a shark in California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while diving for a shark in California on the first day of the shark's feast, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 AD near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego Chad Hammel said he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then jumped in to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a slip of a glue, and then he realized it was a bicycle.
We have been caught!'
His vision was all connected", said Hammel when he approached the boy
"I beckoned everyone to leave the yard: 'There's a shark under the yard!'" said Hammel to him.
The boy was transferred to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego as he is classified as critically ill.
It is not known which shark species was responsible for the attack.
The Conservation Guard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was found in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not considered a dangerous species of shark.
Giles told him that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to his collarbone.
The officers closed the entrance to the beach between Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and for safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there were no more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK scheme market.
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with their multi-storey style scheme passes and special assistants staff.
The campaign is part of a major push into the UK's £2.8bn scheme market, which is still growing despite declining fashion and home goods sales, with the larger scheme passes to be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be rolled out to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in schemes is part of the efforts of supermarkets to fill shelf space in their TV, microwave and home appliances markets.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its scheme items offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current areas from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The wholesale market is also relaunching its boutique cosmetics range, so that most products are usable by vegans - something that is demanded by more young shoppers.
In addition, the retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing flavour in two stores with Sainsbury's, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week; with the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The trends in online shopping and the daily purchase of small quantities of food at local convenience stores are putting pressure on supermarkets to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that the stores will gradually appear as multi-department stores and the chain will seek to compete with the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has installed Argos substitutes in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced several Habitats since buying those two store chains two years ago, which they say has boosted wholesale sales and contributed to the profitability of the additions.
It followed the previous attempt of the wholesale market to radically renew its schemes and pharmacy segments.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots west in the early 2000s, but the merger was terminated after a dispute over how to share revenues from the pharmacies in their supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
They said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, but add an additional range to the luxury brands of niche care that would include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have fundamentally changed the look and feel of scheme passes to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in expert colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all demands, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now the target of excellent schemes that challenge the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million market
Dragons star Peter Jones was left in a rage after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million market for her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for his Truly brand of household goods and accessories.
The duo's business and Goop brand have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has put star Peter Jones of Dragons Den on red tape when she withdrew from her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the weekend - to focus on their new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and with ITV.
Our sources said Jones was "red-hot" when the white TV girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her inner business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she would no longer have enough time with her new markets - already worth up to £1.5 million - to focus on her Truly homewares and accessories brands.
The business has been compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow, and was predicted to double Willoughby's estimated wealth to the equivalent of £11 million.
With Willoughby, 37, announcing on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones went on a plane out of Britain with one of her holiday homes as a target.
The source said: "Truly was at the top of the priorities for Holly.
It would be a long-term future for her to work her life into the decades.
All those involved in its decision to exit the market were withdrawn.
No one believed what was happening because the launch was so close.
A warehouse is filled to the brim with goods inside the Headquarters in Marlow ready for sale".
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter This Morning, one of Britain's most reliable startups in terms of profitability, could cost the business millions due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cartoons and canned goods to clothing and household goods, and further delay its launch.
And it could end a friendship that has lasted for several years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp western in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacations together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production business.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will take on Ant McPartlin's role as host of I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We will not comment on matters relating to his business affairs".
Talk hard 'and we fell in love then'
He laughed at the criticism he received from the news media for the commentary which would be "unpresidential" in the eyes of some, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump yielded so much?
Trump admitted that he was a "news anchor".
"I did not give up anything".
He noted that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump announced as a major step forward towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
The negotiations on nuclear disarmament have reached a conclusion.
It has been more than three months since a summit in Singapore in June when North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly last Saturday that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's initial efforts towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the US is still applying sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure on them.
Trump was far from useless in his speech.
"We are doing great in our dealings with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed if this happened.
And now we have a wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results - they ended rocket tests, helped free captives and brought home the bodies of members of the American armed forces.
And he defended his unusual approach in the way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be so presidential, but instead of 10,000 people being outside trying to get in this crowded place, 200 people would be standing in the stands", Trump said, referring to the crowd right in front of him.
Hundreds of people killed on island by tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
Following the landing on Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they did not need to be present.
Although no more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was evacuated from their own areas, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for generating international aid.
"In many cases unfortunately they said unreservedly that they did not want international assistance, so it is a good challenge", said Mr. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is sending a team in a hurry to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether the foreign team can go to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the case in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of the continuing earthquake in Indonesia, the preparations for the natural disaster are terrible.
Although sun visors have been built in Aceh, they are not common on any other coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning base in Palu, although a warning was in place, probably contributed to the loss of livestock numbers.
Travel between Indonesia's many islands is challenging when it is rainy.
Logistics becomes much more complex with natural disasters.
A hospital ship that was based in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, and will take at least three days to reach the scene of the recent disaster.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's broken infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, and has spent a huge amount of money on roads and railways.
But Joko's administration ran into funding shortfalls as he was re-elected the following year.
Joko is also coming under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as some people from the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as clashes between Christian and Muslim rebels broke out in the streets, with maces, knives and swords, and other deadly weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge finds Liverpool tied at the final in Chelsea clothing
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the match against Chelsea in the Premier League with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge caught a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal and his team to a 1-0 lead.
He carried the ball on his left foot before releasing an attempt with the longest kick.
The attempt flew hard over the box as it approached the top right corner of the net.
The ball caught just over the jump at Kepa Arrizabalaga in the end and fell into the net.
"I just wanted to get to that place, get the ball, and players like Shaq progress as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and I gave one small hit to the ball and I didn't think about it so much and I tried to back down".
Chelsea led 1-0 at Leeds after a 25th-minute goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The centre-forward passed his teammates in the blue vest as far as Mateo Kovacic in that game, before he turned from the centre of the field and rammed Liverpool about halfway across the field.
Kovacic passed and quickly left in the middle of the field.
He threw a beautiful pass through there, which led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defenders and delivered the final kick into the net from his far left ear with his left foot over Alisson Becker with Liverpool's team.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped under the building rubble caused by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck last Friday, generating waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu with a population of 380,000 was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he shot a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7:55 a.m. with bruised bones at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police rushed to the area to tell people who had heard or seen nothing.
Deputy Prosecutor Brian O'Hagan said: 'We are early in the investigation but I would appeal to anyone who was close to John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who thought of anything with their cameras attached to them to contact us as they may have information that would be crucial to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local woman in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside property.
Friends of the woman who believe they knew her have come to the scene this evening to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as police said they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police are telling him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was left speechless when he heard about what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be several hours before they are allowed back in.
One policeman was heard telling one man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came by and was shearing the sheaves.
She keeps saying 'this is terrible'.
Two police veins were inside the defensive line at 2am, with one other vein just outside it.
Several policemen were standing within the defensive line guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and dial 247 on 30 September.
The chrome statue inside the Parliament is the latest monument to be controversial in the rewrite of history
Its abolition would be in compensation for the Taliban's total destruction of many of England's religious cultural sites at the hands of their foreign followers or the so-called Puritans.
The Cromwell Society described Lord Crick's recommendation as "magical" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society said: "The current debate over the removal of the portraits would have to be expected to make the real Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster the target.
The revolution in the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell himself.
Perhaps the wrong Chromos would be sacrificed for actions of the ancestor Thomas in the previous one.
The beautiful real William Hamo Thorneycroft on Chrome is evidence of 19th century speculation, and is part of the historiography of a man many believe to be worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps no more in the 19th century than today, would consider the Crown to be the defender of parliament against external pressure, in this case against the monarchy of course.
The historical debate remains as to whether this is an accurate interpretation of the subject itself.
It is certain that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation from then on, and that he is an identifiable individual who acts as a representative of one half of the elite.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration".
A Chinese farmer is viciously attacked to death by a deadly pig
A farmer's pig was attacked and killed inside a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man surnamed Yuan was found dead with a severed artery, and a mouse with blood near the pig's chest at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported last Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his four companions from neighboring Yunnan province last Wednesday with 15 mugs sold at the market.
His four-horse column came in the following morning and found him dead, and found that a door valve with a pig's head nearby had been opened.
He said there was a big male pig inside the neck with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound moose had violently attacked the farmer or killed him, according to the report itself.
"My quadruple leg was bloody and sore", the quadruple with the surname Wu, said as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found around one o'clock not too long ago.
It was neither Yuan nor his four horns that killed the man.
A market manager told the Evening News that the muck was locked up so that it would not attack anyone else, and the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's people and the market authorities are reportedly in negotiations for compensation for his death.
The records of cases of pig bites on humans are rare.
A woman and her husband's pig attacked them in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig belonging to a British farmer had either been thrown against his tractor or his wife had scolded the animal for a stray.
After a pig ate his farmer in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that a pig is not normally aggressive but a blood smear can act as a shock.
"They only want to have fun.
They are as curious as animals... they have no desire to hurt you.
You have to show them full respect", he said.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the southwest of the US from the remnants of Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening and moving over the cooler plain off the northern coast of Mexico.
Floods with Rosa am am will come from the fields across northern Mexico and the southwestern US in the next few days.
Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane, had winds of 85 miles per hour as of 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a storm is converging across the Pacific Ocean and moving east toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Sunday as a destructive storm, it will begin pushing a deep northward thermal moisture over the southwestern U.S.
Up to 10 inches of signals with Rosa will reach parts of Mexico next Monday.
Heavy rainfall will then be generated extensively with the destructive moisture interacting with the rock approaching in the Southwest for a few days.
Between 1 and 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous avalanches, drizzle and possibly desert landslides.
Destructive deep humidity will cause characteristic rates reaching 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 2 and 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the Southwest, particularly over most of Arizona.
The rapid deterioration of conditions may lead to the occurrence of tulkas due to the nature of the spread of the tropical rainfall.
Foreigners decided to go out into the desert to avoid the danger of the climate.
The heavy rainfall could cause severe flooding of rivers in the valleys, and local wind shear and dust storms will accompany the thunderstorms.
Some heavy rainfall with rock approaching parts of the southern California coast.
The rainfall may be above half a degree, which could generate minor flows and slip roads.
This is equivalent to the first rainfall of the region's wet season.
Some torrential rainfall streams will begin to slowly approach Arizona on Sunday and fall on Monday, before the more widespread rainfall slowly spreads on the following Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
Sharp temperature fluctuations can be seen in October across the US as the Arctic cools, with temperatures remaining moderately warm.
This results in dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A great example of the amazing temperature diversity will be seen across the central US on Sunday.
There will be a temperature variation of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days the final heat of summer will try to boost again.
A warm start to October is predicted for much of the central and eastern US, with temperatures in the 80s widely across the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could be 80 degrees on Tuesday, with 10 degrees in and out above average.
We are indicating with our long-term forecast that there will be a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the US through the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's hearing was watched by more than 20 million people
The real-life testimony of Brett Kavanaugh's nominee to the Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her, with the alleged attack in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on a television network, was watched by more than 20 million people.
Meanwhile, the political backlash continued, with broadcasters breaking into regular registration for Friday's final chorus: an agreement negotiated with Arizona Senator Jeff Flake in front of the FBI to conduct an investigation into the changes that would last only a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was one hundred percent certain that Kavanaugh had crushed her while drunk, and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his deposition, said he was one hundred percent sure it didn't happen.
The Nielsen report on Friday was probably watched by no more than 20.4 million people.
This business included the audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available on the basis of the other networks on which it was shown, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And some surveys typically involve Nielsen measuring the number of people looking into offices.
As a comparative measure, the number of viewers is the same as the number for a qualifying game in American football.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led the networks with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The demand was still high after the hearing.
Flake was at the heart of the play last Friday.
After the moderate Republican official issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning having a meal from viewers while trying to take an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes on it for a few minutes as they were wearing it down, which was live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in front of the country?
Someone told you, "You have the power and many women have little power".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and told him, before the elevator was brought up, that he would have nothing more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks covered the affairs in the hours afterwards, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the assumption that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, something the Democratic elite wanted.
They were negotiated with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, who insisted on Flake.
It was after discussions with Coons and several senators that Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May told the Sunday Times that critics of her plans to leave the European Union were playing "political games" on Britain's future and taking advantage of the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Action Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview near the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson pushed ahead with his attack on his Brexit plan, or Chequers plan as it is called, saying that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect tariffs on each other would be a "clearly unsound" proposal.
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and booked into jail on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The officers released video of the intersection between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The bond was set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report last Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department is recognizing the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens for assisting the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "dedication and determination to bring justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge as his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "thrilled" and "saddened" by Wayde's death.
"That's a concern in the underground", Wade said.
Ash from a volcano is poured down on Mexico City
Ash is being pushed from the Popocatepetl volcano after it has descended on the southern areas of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay clear of the volcano after increased activity inside the crater, and recorded 183 gas and volcanic emissions in a 24-hour period.
The centre was guarding multicellular shrimps and prawns.
The images on social media showed thin layers of ash cover on the windshields of the cars in areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the independence vote on the same day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence demonstrators and police in the city, as thousands took part in competitive demonstrations to mark a one-year anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote.
White cloth separated by egg-shaped puppets and powdered paint fired at the guarded police, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Sneaking also occurred out in the day, with the police using their restraints to contain the fight.
The "No Forget, No Apology" chant in favour of independence was chanted directly in front of united observers on the "Long live Spain" bike.
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries in the explosions, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the region where the desire for independence has been gaining momentum one year after the October 1 referendum which Madrid deemed illegal, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose to be independent by a large majority, although the percentage that came out with a majority of the vote was low among the anti-separation parties.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to disrupt the vote at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
The pro-independence vote was blocked after a demonstration in support of the national police was held on Friday night.
Production continued, but they had to find a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the show of the separated with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
"We saw one of the best moments we ever had last night.
I saw my parents crying in surprise that they could vote, but we are now saved", he said.
Despite a crucial if unlikely victory for pro-independence Catalan parties in last December's regional elections, they have failed to maintain that continuity this year with many of their well-known leaders in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the resulting declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old technician who recorded the broadcast to support the police on his phone, said that the politicians on both sides were fueling the conflict.
"The tension is rising incessantly", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail since late last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"The best way to criticize the backwardness of democratic values and the backwardness of the Spanish government is to run as a candidate in the European elections", he said.
City of Dover: Men arrested after their house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car re-entered a house in Dover.
The incident occurred on the City of Goods Bridge on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Deputy Mayor Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
The car may also have been cross-coordinated at some point.
Menga score gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first back for Livingston secured the win
Livingston's unexpected victory over Rangers was a great success, and was Steven Gerrard's second loss in his 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's score was the difference in the end as Gary Holt's team came to a tie with Hibernian in second place.
He leaves Gerrard's side unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season as they face Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Rangers will be at home against Rapid Wien in the Europa Series next Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile brings his undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt remains unbeaten since coming up against Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not score chances against slow visitors
Holt's team should have advanced well before they scored, and his straightforward approach to the Rangers caused many difficulties.
Scott Robinson broke through the defensive line towards the tail but made his attempt across the mouth of the tail, and then Alan Lithgow could only attempt to put in a catch after slipping in to hit Craig Halkett's head across the tail.
The home team were willing to let Rangers play for them, knowing that they would harm the away visitors with the fixed items.
And it was the way the back was scored.
Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston created a half-century, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson playing together to give Menga a chance, who touched the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Rangers were in possession of the ball at the time, but failed to break the home team's defenses and Liam Kelly's batting was untouched,
That story continued into the second half, although Kelly had to save Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers batsman Alan McGregor's feet closed the door on Scott Pittman and Lithgow flipped in a win from another standing item with Livingston.
Livingston's box was continually entered and cleaned of cross passes, and two of his claims to Irish chic were denied - after Halkett challenged the rep Glenn Middleton, and one on handling.
'Incredible evidence' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont with BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A proof and excellent result for Livingston.
Every player they had improved, exceeding their expectations on that way up.
His playing style and personnel have changed little since returning to the mainstream, but Holt is to be highly commended for the way he has motivated the team since his arrival.
He had so much courage.
Captain Halkett was on the up, overseeing the king-organized defenders, and Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept his guard from start to finish.
A lack of inspiration was seen by the Rangers.
Although they gave excellent evidence of Gerrard's time, they fell far short of their standards.
They missed the last pass - they only broke through the home team once - and it's kind of an eye-opener for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a warm welcome in Cologne
A minute of silence and a blue sky were seen on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - designed to repair relations between the ECAC allies - is the last day.
They reached agreement on a number of issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The largest Turkish population outside Turkey itself is found in that city.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000 crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came out nearby to watch their president.
The roar of the protests against Erdogan was also heard - many of them in Kurdish - sharply criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The sectional haggadahs are a reflection of the visitor's divisions, being worshipped as a hero by some German Turks and sharply criticized as monstrous by others who are not.
Road rage in Deptford: cyclist dies in a collision with car
A bicycle has died in a collision with a car inside London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southwest of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics arrived on the scene, but the man died.
The report comes several months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run crash on Childers Street, about one mile away from the Saturday crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and to contact his relatives.
Roads are closed and buses diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during a riot
Six prison officers have been injured during an attack by the men's high-security vehicle, the Prison Office said.
The accident occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Officials and "Tornado" specialists were brought in to deal with the area, which involves eight peaks and is limited to one cliff.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: 'A dedicated prison team has been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
A staff member was treated for his injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be brought to justice and that they can put another prisoner in the car".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
It was reported in June that the governor of the prison received medical treatment in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And cricket officials were called in last October to deal with a serious incident in which the team was attacked with pollen balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood targets (which may benefit drought areas)
A tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week as a surge of Hurricane Rosa energy heads over the Southwest Desert, with flood hazards.
The National Weather Service issued tornado warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be signaling an approaching Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix stated in a tweet that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained their tropical storm status or weakened within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 inches to 4 inches of precipitation, and isolated sizes up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including the Central Rockies and The Great Basin are likely to have 1 to 2 inches of feature, and isolated populations of up to 4 inches may exist.
For those who are now outside the tulca risk, Rosa's feast could be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of this could be beneficial as part of the South West is currently experiencing drought.
According to the US Drought Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona is directly dry, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa makes landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which is still at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is approaching colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and so it is losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico during the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or night.
The storm could be severe across parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
Total tornadoes of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, and could reach 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa then moved north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then passing through Arizona and entering southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
The main expected damage from Rosa or its very severe meteorological fallout is in California, northeastern Sonora, and the US Southwest Desert, says the National Hurricane Center.
The forest is expected to produce life-sustaining tulkas and stream-fed crops, and produce soil in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted suicide
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed a few times in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police say.
Officials are appealing to anyone who might have a piece of mobile phone footage of what happened to get to them.
Trump said of Kavanaugh, that he "suffered, grief, anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless tactics and scandals of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered from rudeness, and anger" the Democratic Party during this nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her twenty or thirty years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his allegations.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw the high quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day".
A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is like a vote to confirm one of our most capable legal entities, a legal scholar with an outstanding public service record, he told supporters in West Virginia.
The President made a direct reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking of the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not in my run, and I'm in my run really, he said.
That's why I'm all over the place and I'm fighting for great candidates.
Trump said that democrats are on a mission to "deny and obstruct".
The first procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the earthquake, Indonesian tsunamis and the number killed is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, with many people washed up and large waves washing up on the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a wave of up to six meters (18 feet) swept ashore at nightfall, washing many to their deaths and destroying everything in its path.
The quake was caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and so were killed, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it pulled cars, nets, houses, hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, saying the tsunami traveled across the open ocean at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the rim.
Some people climbed trees to escape the zombies and got away safe, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, complex and broken bridges and surrounded by mosquitoes and water.
The coastal city of Satarn was followed by raids.
The series of landslides was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow coastline, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the landslides and damage could be greater along the edge 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earth's crustal core.
Nugroho said there was no information at all in the messages from Donggala.
About 300 000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, saying its staff and volunteers were on their way to the sites to meet them.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become more, she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not providing information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that waves came in within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film clip on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard crouching and giving a panicked warning of approaching zombies to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water creaks into the shore, bringing buildings and cars.
Routers were not able to authenticate the film piece immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami cut off communications around Palu, causing major power outages, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for only emergency work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the displacement centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunamis has exceeded 800.
It's all over the place.
While World Vision's team from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are hiding in peat bogs created in their office yard, they encountered destruction on the way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's all so dirty.
Even as aid groups began the rescue work, many complained that some foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the Palu regulations, no regulations, funding, supplies and staffing from abroad will flow until a disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That has not happened yet.
But it is still a level five disaster, said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government declares, OK this is a national disaster, we can open up for international assistance but there is no status yet.
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of those still missing were still hopeful that their local people would be miracles that would lighten the burden of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a shed.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in a smoker for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesia national para-professional team, trained two of the required para-professionals for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi also said that some of the others who were staying at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a coach in the field of para-medicine, I have my own emotional burden", he says.
Mr Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the parliamentary community, he sent a WhatsApp message to Palu competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival, descending from his throne with anthems.
But his messages resulted in only one gray tick, rather than a pair of blue ticks.
I think that means the messages have not been delivered, he says.
$26,750 stolen during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
A $26,750 theft occurred Friday morning from a Brink worker who was filling the ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was preparing an ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver more money, wrote the editor Dennis McCarthy in the issue.
While he was busy, another man came from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw a number of suspects leaving the scene, according to the release, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with knowledge of who they are should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The man formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the alias Ye for some time now and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her arrival on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to launch her new album Yandhi.
He will be on the show in place of Ariana Grande who cancelled her appearance on the show for "emotional reasons", the show's creator says.
As well as being an abbreviation of the current occupational name, West previously said the word had religious significance to him.
I believe ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you, West said earlier this year, when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, we are we.
It changed from Kayne, meaning the one, to Ye - which is a direct representation of our good, our bad, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of a number of rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z also performed without bottles and without capital letters.
AMLO Mexico pledges not to use the military in civilian clothes
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force in civilian clothes as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student-led revenge.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza not to use the military overnight to subdue the Mexican people.
Troops stormed a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador protested support for young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that youths are being lured into criminal addiction by unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The USA should double its A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in that field, says AI researcher and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who once worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various parts of the US government on AI, even where the US does not have a formal AI strategy as a whole.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
It would be a good start to double the AI research budget, given that all other countries are much further behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI, says Lee.
Doubling the funding would also double the chances of the next major AI discovery in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player a top ranking, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has acknowledged previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next first visions.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee says.
It is not China that is driving academic leaders away; it is corporations, says Lee.
Leaders from universities working on AI have in recent years been employed by Facebook, Google and other technology companies.
Lee said changes to migration policy could help the US boost AI efforts as well.
I think PhDs in AI should be automatically offered a green card, says Lee.
The State Council of China issued its Development Plan for Second Generation Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding for people at academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established an AI Forum, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an AI Intelligence Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been seen in recent months in US legislation to see the creation of a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether or not to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether or not to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a measure to resolve a twenty or thirty-year-old dispute with Greece that has prevented its bids for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims the name of its northern neighbours as a claim to its territory and has blocked its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist rivals argue that the change would take the basis from the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the ballot campaign has cast doubt on whether the voter turnout will reach the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership to accept the agreement with Greece?
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth considering for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
I have come today for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for us all, says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would abide by the outcome of the vote to make it final.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be required for the name change.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent turned out to vote, compared to 34 percent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
I came out to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe, said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 on changing the country's name to pave the way for its participation in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform and was pulling up chairs in front of a pub built by the people who will vote on the referendum.
We are not in favour of NATO and the EU, but we would like to take membership with pride, and not through the service door says Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and be part of European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
I believe there will be a very large majority in favour because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said a vote in favour would be a "declaration of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required voter turnout.
In another poll, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57 of the respondents were found to be planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to succeed, 50 per cent plus one vote must be cast.
A failure to hold the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero makes his way through all of Brighton's Manchester City defenders for a back
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in a 2-0 win at Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's score in the 65th minute looked very easy.
The Argentine centre forward got a pass at the centre of the park at the start of the series.
He ran through three Brighton defenders, before cutting into the open pitch.
Aguero was surrounded by four green lanes then.
He pushed around one defender before running over a few other defenders on the edge of Brighton's box.
He then pushed a pass on his left side, coming on Sterling.
The England starter used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to score the win on Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a knock on the right side of the net.
Aguero has some problems with his feet, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about putting it on for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored back at that moment.
But it was Steirling who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the Premier League clash.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton ground on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touches before guiding Sterling to the end zone.
The Sky Blues starter hit the ball into the net before sliding across a boundary.
City will play in Hoffenheim's Championship group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer would like to play a spoiler against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the deciding game, there was little reason to force another start.
But Scherzer is hoping to take the lead on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but if there are game-tying implications for the Rockies alone, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the WL West.
The Rockies won at least a special place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but they're still trying to win a first division title.
Although we're playing for no reason, at least we'll be able to get our foot in the door in three games and we know the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team playing would probably be the highest level of any point I'd have in front of me this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of that?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Saturn, but are said to usually let Scherzer pitch in such a case.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, spent a practice session Thursday and would pitch his usual Sunday.
Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's slang in West Virginia
The President made an indirect reference to the case of his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh when speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we have done will be at risk in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I'm not in my race but I'm really in my race and that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump then said, "You see this radical group of jokes, jokes, you see it happening right now.
And they're focused on restoring power by using all the means necessary, you see the grit, the superstition.
They do not know who they are going to kill, who they are going to put in charge of power and authority, that is what they want, power and authority, we do not give them that.
The Democrats' mission is to reject and obstruct.
And he said, Behold, it is four days since thou hast seen this, bringing in the nations, and the nations, and the nations, and the nations, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples, and the peoples,
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee classifying the Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein by name, which caused the audience to pay high attention.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
I didn't leak, uh no, I'm waiting for one - that whole body language was bad - the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
They have no take on those who speak out
Although Momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last in the line of Labour Party Members to be told that we are not welcome - all that is a shame we have spoken out.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated almost the same because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the resolution condemned me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, to Europe, questions which, ironically, Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, this was exactly how the GC meetings were held on Fridays.
Unfortunately today, that is not the atmosphere in many of the meetings and the promise of a more generous, secular politics, if it ever really began, has long been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no acceptance of different views in the Labour Party and that every opinion is weighed against whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy was appointed leader, because colleagues who I had previously thought shared a similar political view expected me to change radically and take positions with which I would not agree at all - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and no matter what I say - there will be a vicious social media crowd calling for by-elections, criticizing the politics of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be a Labour Party member.
And that's not just my hope.
In fact, I know that I am more curious than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually about politics.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to endure the daily onslaught of sexual abuse without a backlash.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the way in which levels of poverty are now being accepted.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are not that broad a church anymore and with every "self-improvement" resolution or change in the selection rules the party is getting narrower.
I have been given many advice over the last two years, praising me for not drawing attention to myself, not speaking out so much and then I would be quite right.
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, spurred by the Thatcher government's neglect of my comprehensive school classroom falling to the ground at home, I have sought to campaign for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
I would not have expected anyone in Nottingham East to be confused about my policy stance and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the resolution on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that threats of election fraud or political activism will not stop me from acting in a way that is good for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr not won goes to the top
Two of you may have put the final score on a matter sheet, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this day's all-star Tennants Main Event.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team out of ten that has not.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as the way they took chances, that helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
We have tried our games so far, but we have not won yet, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "To commend Ayr, they took better chances than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute save by Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but, due to a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who the Warriors released for the game, Melrose was able to take advantage of the loads and Jason Baggot takes an unsanctioned lead.
Climo scored Ayr's opening kick with a penalty kick, before, just at half-time, he scored and then saved a leg-to-arm pre-season to make it 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and with Patrick Anderson's shot, which saved Baggot, the gap was reduced to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the park on a stretcher, and from the start, Ayr pushed forward to flood through Stafford McDowall's yard, which Climo saved.
Active captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card then, and again, Melrose gave the extra man a pay cut to Bruce Colvine's unprotected leg at the end of a fierce thrust.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Climo without the ball, from extending the penalty kick, MacPherson caught behind Ayr's forward-moving back.
Climo, as he had been doing since the almost start, recovered after Kyle Rowe collected a high-over-his-shoulder kick from David Armstrong and sent back-up starter Gregor Henry away for a fifth home run.
Still game star seemed to be going for a fresh career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be moving into the hospitality industry after learning he has been named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Ford has the part of Jack Jarvis on the hugely popular BBC show, a show he writes with and corresponds with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that their upcoming ninth series will be the last during the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life change after Craiglang.
According to official record lists, the director is Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in a successful restaurant business in Glasgow.
We are the sea: Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
There is a shortage of ocean-going craft on public buildings.
Water bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are smeared with the manna: We are the sea from the right.
It is my duty to get her back.
Throughout the Bolivian archipelago, the memory of its lost edgeboard against Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh - as well as the hope of launching it into the Pacific Ocean again.
This is the highest level in the last twenty or thirty years, and Bulgaria is awaiting a ruling from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of debate.
Bolivia has a spirit of dynamism, unity and solidarity, and of course looks forward to the outcome with a positive attitude, says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching CBI control on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague vote will be in favour of the Bolivian claim - after bitter talks over the last twenty or thirty years - that Chile has a duty to negotiate and give sovereign access to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the seductive Bolivian indigenous president - who faces a controversial re-election battle next year - is also keen on Monday's rule.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in favour of Bolivia - and a ruling in their favour would make little difference.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has ordered that it not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CBI ruling comes exactly six months after the final arguments were heard shows that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Sík expert in international law.
And not only was the Bolivian case brought forward, but it may have been dropped in the last four years.
The current Bolivian administration has taken a position on the question of access to the sea, says Zarate.
Morales' offensive pushing has wiped out any goodwill left by Chile.
The EU and the US will continue to work together to ensure that the situation in the region is not affected by the crisis.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was more hasty than usual.
Monday will be a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of mutually beneficial differences, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most beloved Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as political support.
Bolgaria will not give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The control is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome history.
North Korea said it will not disarm unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would not disarm its nuclear weapons first if it did not have confidence in Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to act on its word on the commitments made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the opposing sides.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume a nuclear diplomacy that was halted more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said he was disappointed that continued sanctions and US refusal to declare an end to the North Korean War would be left in the dark.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang takes the first significant disarmament measures.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want to have another summit.
But there is widespread speculation that Pyongyang is actually in the process of rejecting a military that the country may see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris shows the latest line in huge headlights that are on their way to Grand Street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, you need not search any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a huge range of highlights from their SS19 collection on the show floor which influenced the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
There have been a lot of very impractical hats being displayed all over Instagram this summer and these designers have put their incredible works on the platform in miniatures.
In the prominent piece with Valentino is an oversized beige hat on which a wide blade resembles a claw that strikes the knuckles of the mares.
Other giant accessories included jewelled water bottles, a hat and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your skull warm.
Thom Browne revealed a selection of odd masks well-in-time for November.
Many of the dyed masks had lipstick and were more like Hannibal Lecter than they were like haute couture.
One piece of work was like a scrubbing device, snorkel and swimming glasses, and some of them were like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you follow the statement too big-luck you are.
Style observers predict that the big damaged boobs may be making their way to the highways near you.
The giant hats come shortly after 'La Bomba', the white hat with a wide two-legged blade seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultured label behind the very impractical hat that was being displayed across social media put another major work on the manicure platform - a soft beach bag that is almost as big as the manicure on which the muscular back is carried.
The flaming orange raffia bag, which had a French raffia decoration and featured white leather straps, was the featured piece in Jacquemus' SS19 collection La Riviera Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I expect big beach hats and bags to hit the main street next summer - given the designer's influence it would be difficult to ignore the massive adaptations.
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a proven record of academic excellence, which was followed in 2018 by another series of excellent examination results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, for the profession of their choice and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector where we can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we are seeing the rise in popularity of modern languages and their choice as a subject of study in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English if we want to build relationships with people from other countries and trust them.
From the latest examination results this year, we see that languages are at the top of the tables ranking with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved an Honours A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 per cent of pupils gained an Honours A Grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent who studied German, 69 per cent who studied French and 63 per cent who studied Spanish also gained an A Grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now seen as a subject choice, as are STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the reasons given by employers for having difficulty filling a vacancy were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
As languages are needed for more potential job opportunities, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession a person chooses, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future of having a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically promote a multilingual person over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of them, 15 per cent.
This is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
Children, especially those in developing economies, who know more than one language are more likely to find decent jobs.
Different languages will be taught in all schools within Scotland.
Some schools will focus on the contemporary and classical languages, while other schools will teach the languages considered to be the most important for the UK looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff specialised in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be denied that languages are still of great importance for the future of the country in today's global business environment, and that this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, languages should be seen as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer that choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien to watch.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play his first Lakers game Sunday in San Diego
The wait is about to be over for fans to see LeBron James in his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he will play is yet to be decided.
"It will be more than one minute and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited time.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-week preseason schedule.
I don't have pre-season games to prepare for at this point in my career, he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, You Tube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of speeches tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five moves over the coming week, including stops in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to retain his choice for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to gain support for the midterm elections because the Republicans risk losing control of the Federal Parliament, when votes are cast on November 2.
What time will Virginia's Trump inauguration take place tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's move to Wheeling, West Virginia is to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
A look at the Trump impeachment in West Virginia can be watched live online on You Tube.
Trump is likely to speak about the ongoing hearings regarding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court.The hearing was tense over allegations of sexual misconduct.The Senate confirmation vote has been postponed for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main aim of the next week's series of elections is to help Republicans, who face intense competition, step up their campaign.
Thus, President Trump's campaign has indicated that these five moves over the coming week were aimed at "incentivizing volunteers and supporters to protect and increase their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
Control of Congress is so essential to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible, as the busy campaign season progresses, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's launch is set to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage in Pittsburgh, according to Metro News, West Virginia.
Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 points in 2016, for the second time in the past month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the Republican primaries.
 It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has come to try to boost the popular vote said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup Team USA show their willingness to be hopeful ahead of Sunday's singles rounds.
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's quarter-final match was perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum is an invented sporting concept, but players believe strongly in it, especially at competitions like this.
So where's the momentum now, do they think?
"They were six points ahead and now it's down to four points, so we have a bit of momentum, I would say", Jordan Spieth said as he walked for the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, with a four-point lead and 12 points to play.
The Americans are optimistic, however, and have very good reason to be, especially because Spieth and Justin Thomas are playing well, together, during the day and can claim to have won by three points out of four.
Spieth is playing great from home to away and setting a good example.
The goalkeeper's goal score rose higher as the round progressed; he scored a necessary goal to win his four games, when he and Thomas were two-thirds of the way down after two holes.
The goal he scored won the game at 15 and allowed the gates, the kind that tells you that the American team has not lost the tournament.
You have to keep your courage and focus on your own game said Spieth.
That's what every player has left now.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The two players, who have more points than Spieth and Thomas, over the two days that have passed are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood and this is the big story of the Ryder Cup.
Four out of four European pairs have won, are happy and can do nothing wrong.
They were the only pair not to hit a bug on Saturday evening, but they avoided bugs, too, on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the second nine o'clock on Friday morning.
The flawless game they play and the way they draw energy from the glorious crowd show that they are both the players to beat on Sunday; and no player would be more likely to achieve a European win under the sun at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be better if both of them won at the same time, but at different holes.
But it is too early to talk about European glory.
It didn't take long for Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson to beat Sergio Garcia, the morning's hero in the four balls, and Alex Noren, his partner.
The Spaniards and Slovenes were stuck in a hole and could not escape after getting a draw and two doubles in the first nine holes.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you escape the pit you yourself have sunk.
The four balls and the four-ball game are so attractive, when viewed closely, because of the interaction between the two, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way in which strategy changes in the blink of an eye.
Europe have been playing better as a team so far and they have a good lead going into the final day, but this quarter-final game showed that Team USA is fighting, although some people, especially in the United States, were skeptical.
Europe leads 10-6 at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good advantage at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup after the four ball and four match, when they took a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The exciting duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the conflict when they had two defeats over Tiger Woods, who was struggling, to reach four points up to that point at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to win the trophy, which they had lost at Hazeltine two years earlier, against a failing American team, had the upper hand in the four balls, leaving the series at 3-1.
The American team was very nervous in the four balls; they had two games but were unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's singles games to retain the crown.
Fleetwood is the first European green to win four straight points and he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood after a super-weekend, are the second pair to win four points in four starts in Ryder Cup history.
They decisively defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls and played two as a unit to defeat Woods, who was weak, and Bryson Dechambeau with an even better win, 5 and 4.
Woods, who had struggled in two games on Saturday, showed great promise but has now lost 19 of the 29 games he has played in the four-ball and four-quarter finals and has now lost seven games in a row.
Justin Rose took a break during the morning four-ball and played again with his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the quarter-finals and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and number three in the world, 2-1 in the quarter-finals.
Europe was not easy, however, in a pleasant day, south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the major championships three times, and Justin Thomas, set the standard for the Americans when they scored two points on Saturday.
They earned a decisive victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the four balls, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit in the singles tournament, although Furyk's team only needs to be in a tie to retain the crown, as they won the crown last year.
However, after two days in second place, they are unlikely to be able to counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says there is no chance of unilateral disarmament due to lack of confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were adding to the mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea has shown "very good" over the past year, in that it has stopped nuclear and missile tests, removed the scene of nuclear tests and pledged not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we do not see any similar response from the United States, he said.
Without any confidence in the United States, our national security will be untrusted and under these circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm, initially by ballistic missile.
While Ri again made North Korea's common complaint about the United States, which opposed a "gradual" approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be given a waiver, as it took small steps, his statement was significant in that it did not reject a clean unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang had in the past.
Ri referred to a conversation between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States, who was still in office, and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work to achieve nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula as long as Trump promised North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War, 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear forces first.
Washington has also put forward a request to ease severe international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on nuclear disarmament as a priority and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve their objective in a conciliatory manner, and opposes war declarations, even, Ri said.
The idea that we can stick to restrictions is the idea of people who are unfamiliar with us.
But the problem is that sanctions, which continue, are adding to our lack of confidence.
Ri made no reference to another summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and also said: If South Korea rather than the United States were the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament, the Korean peninsula would not be denuclearized in this way.
However, Ri's speech was a very different one from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korean missiles would inevitably be targeted on US soil after Trump, "Mr Evil President", "rocket man" on a suicide mission called Kim.
At the United Nations this year, Trump praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm despite last year's threat of "total destruction" of North Korea, but said much more work still needed to be done and sanctions would be maintained until North Korea achieved nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific timeline for disarmament, saying, if it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: the Security Council sanctions must be enforced firmly and without fail until nuclear disarmament is achieved and fully certified.
The Security Council has increased, unanimously, sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not very successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made; but North Korea fired him within hours because he made "claim like a chemist".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to destroy the nuclear site if the US took corresponding measures.
He said Kim told him that his "corresponding measures" were Trump's security promises in Singapore and steps to achieve normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year to increase sleep in all sub-stages is to counter the growing culture of night-time study with the aid of caffeine.
A student found that students at the world's top university have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, put together the course.
He was encouraged to start the course after giving a talk on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said: 'Why wasn't I told this before, and I'm in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was made available for the first time this year, explains to students the key points of good sleep habits and how they help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university medical services, said the university made the decision to introduce the course, when it found that students were very sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a quiz, in which students chew on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books to get answers about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus is then created with interactive icons, allowing participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that it will not change a student's behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you would have a right to know about the health effects of smoking on you", said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of "sitting around at night" is still alive, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that insomnia is a growing problem.
Students should ensure they get enough good quality sleep as a 'secret tool', he said, to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep turns the brain into a hunger mode, as it is regularly hungry.
Raymond So, 19, from California, who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and he grew up to find a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the sub-graduates to do the same study programme, before entering the competitive institution.
The Professor suggested that students should set an alarm at bedtime, as well as an alarm at wake-up time and be aware of the adverse effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's backs against Gerrard's men
Rangers again lost away as, due to Menga's back injury, Steven Gerrard's minor team were beaten 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox team were looking for their first home win since a 4-1 defeat at St Johnstone in February, but were beaten by Gary Holt's side, Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager.
Menga hit the back seven minutes before half-time and there was no chance of Rangers, lacking in inspiration, being able to score.
While Rangers are down to sixth place, Livingston is up to third place and only the backs are the difference between them.
Further trouble may lie ahead for Rangers, after lineman Calum Spence received medical treatment for a head injury from some material he apparently threw away from home.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that easily beat Ayr to secure a place in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt retained the same 11 players, who had taken a point from Hearts the previous week and would have been very pleased with the way in which his well-trained team had rocked the opposing husband.
Rangers may have had the ball mostly but Livingston was more involved with the possession they gained.
Livingston should have scored after two minutes, when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pitman, who took a kick towards Allan McGregor's back but went out on penalties.
Keegan Jacobs took a free kick that went to captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow with his kick only managed to put him on the bench.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed that they had hope rather than faith in the manner of play they were playing, in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had earned an Irish kick after the fourth hour, when he hit against Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson did not take the Columbia man's plea.
Rangers managed only two checks towards the back but Ibrox full-back Liam Kelly had no difficulty breaking Lassana Coulibaly's head and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi may have had a 34th-minute kick against the pattern of the match, it cannot be denied that they deserved it because they had made an excellent effort.
Again the Rangers failed to deal with a fixed point in the starts from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not answer his pass from Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and passed it to Menga, who put it in the back.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change had an immediate impact as he passed to Morelos, who hit him towards the back but Kelly, who had a super-play, pushed him from his line to overtake the ball.
But Livingston continued to entice the visitors to play the kind of game they liked.
Holt's side could have scored an extra towards the end of the game but McGregor held the lead well to beat Jacobs and Lithgow scored from a corner kick that went out of bounds.
Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had a late demand for Irish chic when he had a split with Jacobs but again, Thomson, the fixer, looked the other way.
The following is a list of the species of the genus Geiger.
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today ....... the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, was born Hans Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for finding and measuring radioactivity, a discovery from which the device known as the Geiger Assessor was made.
The Geiger effect is a cornerstone of science since then. It has also been a cornerstone of pop culture. In the 1950s, a film starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans was made.
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger assay, used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms caused by the radiation released from the minerals.
Evans: Yes, he's definitely playing now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention for which it is named still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to check for tumour cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to check and kill cancer cells.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of a medical treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory.
They can then test for proteins that are common in many cancers and then re-inject them.
An experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one case, a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system how to recognise blood cells, had her ovarian cancer completely gone for 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can check a protein, common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said:  Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that is very promising.
HER2 develops several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and cholera cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach worked, in which immune cells were taken from patients and taught how to target cancer cells to treat a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West started to gossip about Trump, wearing a MAGA Hat after he was on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was beaten in the studio after Saturday Night Live after he gave a free show in which he recommended the United States and President Donald Trump, who he said would run for office in 2020.
When it was not the third song to be named Ghost Town, he was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat.
 I talk so often in it with a white person who says: 1. How could you hate Trump, he's not racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved away from America", he said.
SNL opened the show with a magic sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations, performed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, the comedian, Chris Rock, uploaded Kanye West's video on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with the post.
Also, the audience had complained that he was falling in the back seat over the headgear he was wearing.
They beat me in the backseat.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on".
They bullied me!
And then, they say I'm in a low place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: Do you want to see the low place? He said that he would put a superman cab on it because it means you can't order me around. Do you want the world to move on?
Trying out for love.
He was beaten at least twice for things he said and made it seem like staff members were embarrassed, Variety reported; one person told the magazine; The whole studio was his job.
West was named to the list as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a demo of the song I Love it dressed as Perrier's Border Collie.
The head of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, supported West in a tweet:  To one of the bravest personalities: Thank you for standing up to the masses.
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that Kanye West was "as is" and that's all great.
But I choose not to compensate a person (buying his music or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, accepts and promotes ideology that is harmful to my own people.
It's free.
We, too, are on the sidelines.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying his official name was now Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, has the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the famous musician, Prince, who is no longer alive, changed his name to Il symbol and then to the artist already called Prince.
Charge of attempted murder in connection with a drink in a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in the town of Hakamaru, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast District Court on Monday.
The Prosecutor's Office shall examine the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks the manhood of a poison.
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow, the violent, medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has challenged stereotypes of the male hero, saying that such parts on screen often mean young boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes something is going wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the MeToo era.
Kit, who is married to his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also recently admitted that he feels strongly about dealing with the issue.
Personally, I feel strongly at the moment - where are we going on the path of manhood? he said.
What lessons did we teach men when they were growing up, in terms of the problems we see now?
Kit believes that television may be responsible, in part, for the increase in venomous masculinity, thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: What is native and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets tells young boys that they must be sure before they grow up.
I think that's one of the big questions we have - how do we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong with the young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be taking part in any prequel or sequel stories, when the series ends next summer, saying "there are no more battlefields and horses left".
From November, Kit will star in a revival of True West Sam Shepard.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
I met my wife on this show and, therefore, gave me my children and my future life, he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character, Jon Snow, was in love with in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say the disease has infected more than 820,000 people in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were spread through sex, a change from the previous situation.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China, due to infected blood transfusion.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way has fallen dramatically and, hardly, no one is getting it now, said Chinese medical officials in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is increasing by 100,000 a year.
HIV transmission through sex is a divisive issue in China's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70%-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the spread of the disease occurs from sexual protection, which is lacking in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised full availability of HIV medicines to try to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators' data was leaked by staff members and denounces "disinformation lies and conspiracy theories".
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday filed allegations that a member of her own staff leaked personal information about three Republican U.S. senators or posted the information on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat reported that the information was being promoted by far-right commentators and websites.
 Lies, lies and more lies  Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information provided reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch who both hail from Utah.
The information was made available online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel examining allegations of sexual misconduct, which were directed at Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made public sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Reserve sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identified the source of the posts as being linked to Waters' office and that the information was provided about a member of Waters' team who reported the Hill.
This allegation is completely false, Waters continued.
The staff member - whose identity, personal and security information has been provided as a result of these allegations, which are fraudulent and false - was not in any way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This accusation is totally false.
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online. Among those who denounced it was former White House prisoner Ari Fleischer.
This denial is outrageous, wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she is not in a fit state of mind to be a Member of the Conference.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
It should not be challenging.
He should not question the prosecutor's reasons.
He should be calm and quiet.
Fleischer was apparently comparing Waters' response to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by critics for looking too forward during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro is a Republican candidate in the race to win the Waters seat in the midterm elections; he also expressed his views on Twitter.
It is a big deal, if true, he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that the guilty are identified, she continued, and held accountable for their actions, which are recorded and recorded for every member of my staff.
Johnny English is doing Business Again - a sneak peek at Rowan Atkinson's espionage without a point of effect.
It is now traditional to see if the British accent is important in any new film with a British bent and this seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English franchise, which involves a comedy-style action-packed storyline.
Will the language in the crowd, as terrible as we are, become a new export right for the nation?
However, Johnny English has regained a license to make a fuss of affairs with his bulging eyes.
He is, of course, the secret, sophisticated, high-flying agent who thinks he is seductive, but who is like Clouseau, a combination of Mr Bean and the one who provided the single note for the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is based from the outset on the traveller and international, mysterious man who Atkinson once took part in Barclaycard TV commercials, but is now forgotten in which he left everything in his wake.
There are a few nice points in this movie, the latest JE.
I was very tired of Johnny English as he walked towards the helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval knight's cape and the rotors banging against his watch at one point.
Atkinson's triumph for body composition is visible, but the humor is really weak and excessive, especially since real movie brands like James Bond and Mission Impossible now offer humor as part of the films.
The comic seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me the Johnny English satirical myth is not as fresh and focused as the Mr Bean comic in Atkinson's silent films.
The current perception is that Great Britain has a big problem.
A cyber hacker has slipped into the secret British spy network and the names of British agents have been leaked. This puts the agent on duty in a very small role, unfortunately, for Kevin Eldon.
The disastrous blow to a prime minister, a serious person, who is under pressure; already, he has a complete breakdown in public opinion: Emma Thompson does her best with the character, who is similar to Teresa-May, but can do little with the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that the names of all spies have been leaked and that she must find someone, who is out of the picture.
And this is Johnny English ineffective. He is employed, at present, in a rather cool, but he is giving classes, in a secret manner, on how to be your secret agent. There are some jokes here as English's offer is to provide a Roc-A-Fella-type espionage academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former partner, Bough, whose role is again taken by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a sub-continent lord, a small-time trickster, who has too much Vicki Pepperdine in him.
So Batman and Robin, who find everything wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are back in action.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being hunted by a tech-obsessed billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough embark on an efficient pleasantry act: while dressed as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create a hit-and-run while boarding a Volta luxury yacht, secretly; English creates an airplane, when he tries to use a Virtual Reality device to get information about the interior of the Volta house.
They do their best for the final act, but while it is lively and vibrant, the whole thing looks like children's TV.
A moderate enough subject.
And as with other films by Johnny English, I thought: can the British film industry play Rowan Atkinson, who fits his abilities?
The Labour Party says it is planning a four-day workweek for British workers but that they will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan, in which Britons will work four days a week, but be paid for five.
The party is reportedly demanding that the leaders of the bodies give money, which they will save through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
The workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would still be paid the same.
Sources said the idea would be relevant to the party's economic programme and its plans to change the country in favour of workers.
The Trade Union Congress has agreed to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal, which suits the party's approach to give the worker an advantage and the party's industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first group to agree with that idea, as the Green Party campaigned a four-day workweek during the 2017 General Election.
The Labour Party, however, does not generally agree with the target at present.
The Labour Party spokesman said: It is not the party's policy to have a four-day workweek and the party is not counting on it.
The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference to articulate his vision of a social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power away from "unnamed directors" and "profits from utilities".
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in water bodies will not get their full share because the Labour government could build up levies on the grounds that something had gone wrong.
It also confirmed plans to give workers seats on the boards of the body and to create Universal Ownership Funds and to give 10% of the shares in the body to employees, who can receive annual dividends of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, and 60 Minutes discuss whether or not the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court has been delayed for at least a week, due to an FBI investigation into allegations against the Kavanaugh Trial.
In an interview aired on Sunday on 60 Minutes, Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham's Scott Pelley asked if the FBI could obtain any information that would change their minds about him.
Kennedy seemed to have a more open mind than his South Carolina colleagues.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
Durable as I enter the hearing, sadly, I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
And it came to pass after this, that he was called, and the accuser came out, and said, Thou hast done this thing.
He was firm, determined, and did not give in to the temptation.
It seems, however, that Graham's vote is certain.
"I have a strong opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and he would make a serious accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett shot him through", said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone she named can confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't think anything new will change it.
What is World Citizen's Day and has it done anything to reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen's Festival, an annual event, which features big stars and also has a very important mission: to end global poverty.
This is the seventh year of the World Citizens' Festival and thousands of people will be drawn to the Big Apple in Central Park to enjoy musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to draw attention to the stated goal of the event, which is to end real poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen's Festival is an extension of the World Poverty Project, which began in 2012.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket) concertgoers had to perform a number of tasks, or acts such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or using any other useful means to spread awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
How successful was Global Citizen with 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is giving people a free concert really the way to get them to act, or is it just another example of the click-throughs - people thinking they're making a real difference when they sign an online petition or tweet?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has a record of over 19 million actions from its supporters, seeking to promote various causes.
He says these actions have helped to motivate world leaders to make pledges and promote policies, worth over $37 billion to impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and notices of withdrawal from its actions, at least $10 billion of which has been donated or collected as part of a fundraising activity.
The group estimates that the money raised has already directly affected 649 million people worldwide.
Among the pledges made are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and pledge-executor group committed to helping children develop their potential and pledging a total of $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving 4700 tweets from World Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and World Citizens like yourself, we can end malnourished social inequality said Tracy Ullman, Food Power ambassador, to the crowd during the live music concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a fund for projects, The Power of Nutrition, which will help 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website, which asks the question  why do you think we can end real poverty?
Global Citizen replied: It will be a long, hard road ahead - from time to time, we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights movements and the anti-apartheid movements to come, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Musicians taking part in this year's event, in New York, include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe.
US Navy could use 'insurgency' to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can use the Navy if necessary to stop Russian energy from being sold in markets, including the Middle East, according to US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's actions in Syria, as it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, are not an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to make energy decisions as they do in Eastern Europe, the weakest part of Europe.
And, according to the officer, there are always ways to deal with it.
The United States, with the Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the seaports are kept open, and if necessary, to conduct dredging, to ensure that their energy is not available on the market, he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at the event, hosted by the Energy Consumers' Association, a non-profit group that claims to be the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach, when dealing with Russia and Iran, indicating that it is similar.
The economic choice for Iran and Russia is to influence and replace fuels, to a greater or lesser extent, he said, referring to Russia as "always a country" that relied heavily on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and, according to Trump, have "screwed" Moscow from Berlin.
Moscow has often said that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a single economic project, costing $11 and increasing the capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin claims that Washington is strongly opposed to it, for economic reasons and that it is an example of unequal competition.
I believe we agree that fuel cannot be used as a leverage tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
Germany has responded to the US position and has reaffirmed that it will continue with the project.
The main German industry organisation, the Confederation of German Industry (CTG), has called on the United States to stay out of the European Union's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a serious problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, leader of the Confederation of German Industry (CTG) after recent meetings between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will Carefully consider running for President in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would consider  carefully running for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
It is time for women to go to Washington to fix the broken government and consider then a woman is in charge, she said according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will be watching carefully the presidential race.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the town hall rally, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
I am deeply concerned about the impact of Donald Trump on our democracy, she said.
Warren Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, openly criticized Trump.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "I'm sure we'll have an FBI investigation before we vote".
A poll conducted on Thursday showed that a large majority of voters in the Warren constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to a poll by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent supported her to stand in the election.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick had the most support, with 38 percent supporting him to stand and 48 percent opposed.
Among the Democrats, who were in the public eye discussing their 2020 presidential bid, were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin of the National Stress Institute (NSI), who is on Track Palin, is cheering for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Police arrested him Monday night and charged him with a domestic violence incident.
"My own son has been suffering since he came back and I can understand the difficulties other families have with Western Stress Disorder. I understand the trauma that returning soldiers have and the disease that is taking them away", she told the audience cheering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin  gave what no one wants to talk about about her arrest and said about her son and other war veterans,  they come back and they are different, they are cruel, they come back and they doubt whether the public respects what their comrades and comrades and all other members of the military have done, what they have done for their country of origin.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence assault on a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States support the challenge of the new asylum policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing drug-related or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district complained in a court-appointed amicus brief on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker, who was flouting the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the lawsuit, Grace v. Sessions, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not mentioned.
She said she had been abused by her partner and violent son who is a member of a gang, but US officials refused to accept her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys, who supported Grace, said that El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, many of whom seek asylum in the United States, were nations with widespread drug and domestic violence problems.
The new asylum policy in the United States was a response to a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants, fleeing domestic violence, to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "disregards twenty or thirty years of state law, federal law, and international law".
Under federal law, all asylum claims must be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and the current ban undermines that principle", said the court's friend.
Attorneys further argued that the policy, which banned immigrants, had harmed the US economy; they argued that they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered a permanent term trial without asylum for victims, fleeing family abuse and violence at the hands of their families, in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home countries, due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, said Sessions in his policy statement on 11 June.
Refuge was never meant to solve all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day around the world.
Despite the train attempts made in Palu, the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors.
The story was getting more and more horrible for the people who survived.
"I feel the tension", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy at an evacuation centre in the city of Palu, which had burned to the ground.
Every minute a patient carries a body in.
Clean water is scarce.
Settlers were seen returning to their destroyed homes, hauling through wet, battered personal belongings; they tried to save whatever was available.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, which had been destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to cope.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken weight and shoulder, were allowed to rest outside the Palu Army Hospital as medical treatment was being given to patients, as powerful aftershocks continued.
He was in tears as he spoke of the terrible earthquake, which hit the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughters.
We had no time to save ourselves.
"I think it was pushed into the rubble",Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that her children were in the big city for a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then everything fell apart.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe, safe.
The US ambassador is raving about China with propaganda ads.
A week after China's official newspaper placed a four-page ad in a daily newspaper in the United States, the US ambassador to China told Beijing that China was using American newspapers to expand propaganda.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the supplement in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - paid for by the China Daily - after it accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections.
Trump's indictment showed Beijing was seeking to interfere in the US election a new phase in a campaign, which Washington is stepping up to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a trade war, which is escalating and has resulted in both imposing tariffs on their imports.
China imposed counter-tariffs early in the trade war to hit a state like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and a former governor of Iowa, which exports many agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China is using this propaganda by placing propaganda ads in free American newspapers, Branstad wrote in an article that reflected his views in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper.
The Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press to spread its propaganda, when it posts ads, which it pays for in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, you won't hear many dissenting voices at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing.You won't see the different opinions that Chinese people may have on China's economic policy, which is divisive, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He continued: "One of China's major newspapers declined an offer to publish his article, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans pushing women voters out of the door ahead of the Kavanaugh Midterm Elections, according to Analysts.
As many prominent Republicans stand aside and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially from women during the midterm elections, is on the horizon.
People are very concerned about this and most Republicans have already said they want to go ahead with a vote.
These things cannot be undone, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said there was much doubt about the efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican-Arizona), who tried at the last minute to get an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning this "November is coming!" cry was heard from protesters as they demonstrated in the Senate chamber. The Republicans, who controlled the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who reported Mic. 2.
The Democratic enthusiasm will be greatly increased and will give them a lasting boost", said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
People say he's high, already; it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among women between the two councils, in the suburbs and among younger voters, people aged 18 to 29 who do not like the President but do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which showed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there might be a counter-argument, if Republicans would proceed to confirm the nominee.
This is a fundamental blow to the GOP, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
It is not just about the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanagh is appointed to the bench, it is also about how Republicans have dealt with this and how they have treated her, said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, there seems to be a split among Americans, who of the two will believe Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony and a few more believe Kavanaugh.
A new poll shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or necessarily believe Ford's evidence and 35 percent of respondents said they fully or necessarily believed Kavanaugh's evidence.
Also, 38 percent of them said they believed, wholly or necessarily wholly, that Kavanaugh lied in his testimony while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure exerted by Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while under the influence of alcohol, when she was seventeen.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court revealed the names of her genitals to her, when they were present at a ceremony at the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The man who invented the World Wide Web has plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, is about to start a new initiative, which will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the renowned technologist, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, and who is allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the stated goal of Inrupt is "global expansion".
We must do it now,he said of the initiative.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create a personal data repository, online or create a POD.
It may include contact details, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's about how Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser and all of them at the same time.
The specific feature of the online repository of personal data is that it is only the user who can grant access to a person, who has a specific type of information.
The body gives:personal capacity through data.
Inrupt's idea, according to its CEO, John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently the body consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several developers on the team, who have contracts to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which their existing business models would be fundamentally transformed overnight.
We do not ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission was to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem, to help protect the integrity and standards of the new network, built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee fundamentally changed the Internet, when he established the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the past few months, a voice, influential in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet, has been in Berners-Lee.
Even as he runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of the Internet", said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War 1 is commemorated.
A clergyman in the Church of England, the only clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier, is commemorated in his home town.
Lieutenant-Colonel, The Honourable Bernard Vann, won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sailor four days later and never knew that he had won the highest rank in the British army.
Her two young children unveiled stone memorabilia at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his sons, Michael Vann, said it was "a great symbolism" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette of 28 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his regiment across the Canal de Saint-Quentin under heavy fire and heavy attack from park guns and machine guns.
He then pushed up to the line of the shooters and with "excellent courage" led the line forward before rushing a park gun alone and laying three of the deflected.
German naval officer killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of World War I.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were  something I could never do but something that goes to my heart.
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, laid a wreath after the parade, which was founded by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt honoured to take part in the parade and that the support of so many people was a sign of courage and true heroism.
IMMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 but, instead, found Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've been sitting in your chair all night watching Bellator 206, which is packed to the rafters but you fail to look at the main event.
There were 13 fights on the San Jose fight list, six on the main roster and it was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory Mac Donald were preparing to fight each other, the UK audience was stunned when the cover was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not too built after they had stayed sitting until early morning to see the fight.
One follower commented on the change to children's cartoons on Twitter.
The programme was not suitable for government regulation and, therefore, they had to switch to children's programmes, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of Bellator, in charge of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa the mouse, yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will be working on the schedule to provide coverage to UK viewers in the future.
I think, when I think about the fight back, we can work it out, says Coker.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work this out until this time on Sunday and then Monday.
But we're trying to fix it.
Believe me, when the agenda changed back then, there were a lot of texts going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to set five rounds instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give the fans too much and we went too far.
It's a terrible situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "up" because of his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt he was not as good as others when he was growing up because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to make progress.
The 24-year-old says he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like me.
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that as a parent now, winning the Olympics was not so important to him.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
On Laverne's first episode as a man on a deserted island, Daley said that he saw himself as "less than everybody else" when he was growing up because it was not socially accepted that boys and girls liked a man.
He said: 'To this day, those feelings of feeling less than myself and feeling different are the things that have definitely given me the power and strength to be able to achieve things.
He wanted to prove that he was something, he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about their sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympic Games is now a public spoken-word activist for LGBTI people (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender).He used his presence at this year's British Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to de-discriminate against homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any involvement and wanted to give hope to others.
Daley, a three-time world champion, said he "got a kick out of it" when he fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him last year but said there was never any problem with the age gap.
When you suffer so much at a very young age - he went to the Olympics, first, when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had so much upside down in his life.
The couple have been parents since June They have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that their whole outlook on life had changed.
If you asked me last year what was important, it was all about winning a gold medal, he said.
You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold base.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the starting lineup.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be around to be in the starting lineup, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and I didn't realize he wasn't unconscious until he stopped breathing and he was dead", he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
I knew that this was my lifelong dream - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, it couldn't have felt better, he said.
It inspired his first song choice, also - Proud by Heather Small - which influenced him in the preparations for the Olympics and still resonates with him.

Mickelson, not performing properly, was placed on the bench of the representatives in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will reach the milestone on Sunday when he plays in a Ryder Cup match for the 47th time, but he will have to improve his game, if he wants it to not be a bad occasion for him.
Jim Furyk, the captain, sent Mickelson to the bench for the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday.
Despite being in the middle of the action, as was often the case for the United States, Mickelson, who had won five major championships, divided his time as a proposed goalkeeper and practicing his playing on the field in the hope that he could solve any problem that was holding him back.
Never able to hit the ball directly, even when at the top of his field, the 48-year-old is not at all suited to a corner course with National Golf, as the fleet regularly throws away for stray balls.
And if the course itself isn't hard enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will be competing against British Open round-robin Francesco Molinari, whose first-year partner Tommy Fleetwood has won all four matches this week.
If the Americans get off to a good start, with four points to spare at the start of the 12-game singles, Mickelson's game could be extremely important.
Furyk showed that he was confident, but he could not say much else.
He fully understood the part he had to play here today, he complimented me and said he would be ready tomorrow, Furyk said.
He is very self-confident.
He's a man who has achieved a lot in the past, and he's done that with these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I dreamed more, but that's the way it worked out and we thought that was the direction we had to move.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's curiosity for the person who plays the most games on Sunday.
It could bring an end to a sphere that had never been as good as his personal quest.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said there were some things that were off-limits to the team because of his presence.
He is funny, sarcastic, quick-witted, likes to be spanked by people and is a great person in the teamroom, he explained.
I think the young sports players have stopped being spooked, too, this week, which was fun to watch.
It offers more than the play.
Thomas Bjorn understands that a big storm can pass quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from his own experience that a good goal at the start of the final day of singles in the Ryder Cup can create a difficult day.
The Danish made his debut in a 1997 game at Valderrama, as a team under his captain, Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans but barely managed to break the gap between them, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost and at Valderrama, when we won, but barely, said Bjorn, pictured after watching Class 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and again yesterday to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will tell me and everyone else that this is not over.
Immigrate one hundred percent tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
This is not about the points being on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, and stay focused there.
I've already said, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we know very well who is on the other side - the best players in the world.
Bjorn was angry about the way his players played and said: "I don't want to get too into it.
Another day is tomorrow.
Tomorrow is about the way in which each individual player creates and there is something different to do then.
It's great to be out with a party, when things are going well, but when you're out alone, then you're fully testing your potential as a golfer.
That's the message you have to give to the players, that is to play to the best of your ability tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and those who play to the best of their ability, too.
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will ultimately be aiming for his players to be able to play better as singles than they do as teammates.
Furyk has experienced the two consequences of a major change on the final day as he was a member of the team that won at Brookline and then being a member of the team that lost, when Europe reached the Medinah Tour.
I remember every word of it, he said in response to a question about Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 and how he greased his players at the start of the final day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow but you want to start well about it like you saw at Brookline and at Medinah.
When this energy is passed on to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the joints in the middle of the limbs.
So we set up our team and we put the players out there like we were going to, you know, create some magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with showing leadership in the upcoming match and is facing Rory McIlroy in the main draw and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the first half of the day.
I joined this man's group because I think they will be good for the whole day, said Bjorn about his preferences for the singles matches.
The German warship is again put back.
The newest frigate of the German Navy to replace the World War I-era battleship was supposed to be commissioned in 2014, but will not happen until next year, due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was due to become part of the Fleet in 2014, but there were major post-delivery problems that greatly hampered the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen frigate.
It has been suggested that they will include a super-powerful cannon, a combination of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as remote sensing technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features are longer maintenance periods - it may be possible to deploy the newest frigates for two years off home ports.
But, because of the continuing delays, the state-of-the-art warships - which would allow for a demonstration of power abroad - will be outdated by the time they are ready, says Die Zeit.
The frigate was in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder after acceptance.
Little was known about the reasons for the ship's return, but German media cited some "hardware and hardware" allegations if it had not deployed on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg-type frigates will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - half of the crew were on older Bremen-type frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces the ship's performance and limits the Navy's ability to upgrade in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, weighing 7,000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
With the exception of heavy goods, the cost of the entire project - including the cost of staff training - becomes exponential.
The cost is said to have increased to €3.1 billion ($3.6) - up from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigate are of great importance because of the recent warnings that the German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the fleet was running out of ships that could be evacuated.
The official said that the question had increased over the years because old ships were decommissioned but not replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg type frigates were able to be part of the Fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of leatherbacks.
New research on estates in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how the leatherback uses the countryside to hunt for food.
The new results are expected to shed light on the unique flight behaviour of the mammoth and help guide future conservation activities.
The scientists at the Scottish National Trust will continue their study of common leather wings and soprano pipistrelles, as well as Daubenton leather wings at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records shall be kept at special locations around the estate to follow the activities of the leather wings during the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) staff shall carry out mobile surveys using handheld sensors.
An acoustic analysis of each recording, carried out by experts, will establish the frequency of the calls made by leatherbacks and what each particular species does.
Habitats shall be mapped and then described to reflect a record of their behaviour in a landscape overview.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser to the Scottish National Trust, hopes the results will reveal the most important habitats for the leatherbacks and the way each species uses them.
This information will help to demonstrate the benefits of habitat management such as mine-making and how best to conserve forest land for leatherbacks and other related species.
The number of leatherbacks in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by building and development projects that deplete their forests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and shingles can be toxic as can paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by cat pets.
Leather wings are not blind, really.
However, their night-time spying habits make their ears more useful than their eyes, which are used to detect rocky material.
They discover insects and bugs in their flight path from a nest, a sophisticated technique.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very much under the leather wings.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the seabed and, occasionally, rescue.
The organisation has established a dedicated leather wing sanctuary, the first and only in Scotland, at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the best district for them.
"We have a great area for leather wings here at Threave", he said.
We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and good habitats.
But there is still a lot we don't know about leather wings, so the work we do here and in other states will help us understand what they are in order to make them successful.
It stresses the importance of checking leather wings before maintaining buildings and dwellings, as destroying a single maternal leather could kill up to 400 female leatherbacks, young leatherbacks and possibly all leatherbacks in that area.
Leatherbacks are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, destroy their feathers or fur.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an Albanian officer for the Leather Wing Conservation Trust, asks the public for help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our leather wings and, for many of our species, we don't know how entire populations of them are doing.
Ronaldo denies the accusation as lawyers are about to put the law on a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called an alleged rape "false news", saying people "want to give themselves publicity" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to take legal action against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus star has been accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a live Instagram video to his followers several hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, attacked the reports and called them "false".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. " The word "no" is not from the Father, but from the Son.
What they're doing today is a lie, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is natural.
They want to be famous, when they say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player said and laughed.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to build a legal case against Der Spiegel over the allegations.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the player would seek compensation for damages, at a level commensurate with the gravity of the breach, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room as he allegedly raped her, according to papers filed at the Duquesne County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was 99 percent fine but the a one percent let him down.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that the two had sex but that it was consensual sex.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed at a hospital but that she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of revenge" and was "afraid of being shamed in public".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the arrangement because she is very, very tired, always, about the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, when the alleged incident happened, and this summer, he moved to a huge club, Juve, in a deal worth €100 million.
The UK would be forever in debt if it lost carmakers.
The UK would be forever in debt if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Business Secretary.
He said it was "a cause for concern" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EEC unresolved, it would stop car production at its factory at Burnaston, near Derby.
"We have a solution", said Mr Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that jobs could be lost if there were delays at the border if there was no solution to Brexit.
The Burnaston plant - which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced some 150,000 cars last year and exported 90% of them to the rest of the European Union.
I think if Britain leaves the EU without a solution at the end of March, our factory will stop producing cars said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers have expressed concern about an unresolved EU exit over the way cross-border trade will operate; these include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main warning signs for car manufacturers are the risks to supply chains in the event of unresolved Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a direct-to-time basis.Parts come from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes for a custom car.
If the UK leaves without a solution on 29 March, there could be interference at the border, which could lead to delays and parts shortages, the industry says.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan was "precisely designed to avoid delays like this at the border".
We must have a solution.We want the best solution, not only to continue our current success, but to seize this opportunity", he told the BBC.
The evidence we have from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with supply chains, which are currently very profitable.
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, it said that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factories and that jobs would eventually be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader for Unite at the factory, said his members were increasingly worried. In my experience when these jobs go, they never come back.
Government spokesmen said: We have provided a plan, which is precise and reliable, for the future relationship with the EU.
The meeting between Trump and the White House may be delayed again, the White House says.
An important meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy attorney general could be postponed to another week as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, relationships between Trump special counsels and the possibility that the president obstructed justice.
Whether or not Trump will break the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the backdrop for Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wire-tapping to record associates with Trump and the possibility of the president being removed from office through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein shed the description.
But he went to the White House this past Monday and the story out that he was about to resign his post.
It was instead announced that a meeting on Thursday with Trump would be at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein but then postponed the meeting to avoid marring a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who had alleged sexual misconduct against him, Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate hearing.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said: There is no date set for it yet, it could be this week but I could imagine it being postponed another week on top of all the things going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters would disagree with that statement: Sanders has not had a press briefing since September 10.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked her why this was the case.
Sanders said the information sessions were not lacking because he did not want TV reporters to make excuses, although she said: "I would not deny that they do".
She then hinted that Trump would have more direct contacts with the press.
The President has more question and answer sessions than any previous President, she said but did not mention any evidence of this. We looked at these figures.
There will be briefings, Sanders says, but if the press gets a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's a thousand times better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do that often over the last few weeks and that will be included in a press briefing when you're able to speak to the President of the United States.
Trump often answers questions while leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences with high-profile visitors.
Individual preaching is rare.
Perhaps the president showed why in New York this week when he met a squad of reporters in a way that was sometimes unconventional.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about their concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU NHS workers in Scotland to express the country's thanks and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to paying the cost of applying for resident status by EU citizens working in public sector services.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: 'Negotiations have been under way between the UK and the EU on the British move, and a decision is expected in the autumn.
But the UK government is stepping up its preparations for a no-deal exit.
I know this story is very upsetting to all of you.
That is why I would like to express my appreciation for the work of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and further afield have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
There is no doubt that Scotland is your home and we would like you to stay here.
A Graduate Operation Made on Christion Abercrombie When He Shot His Head
Mike Organ of the Tennesseans reported that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after injuring his head in a 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores loss.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the edge and fell flat", Reed said.
Trainees and medical staff provided oxygen to Abercrombie on the sidelines before putting him on a ventilator and sent him back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been taken from the lab at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said there is no information on the nature/size of the injury yet and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a redshirt sophomore and this is his first season playing for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before leaving the game making him 18 tackles in total during the season.
Higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK
Higher stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people under the Tories' plans

Stamp duty will be charged to those not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury estimates that £120 million a year will be raised to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce a higher rate of stamp duty on foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The plan will be seen as an attempt to end the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
Stamp duty will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK and the extra money will be used to speed up the Government's efforts to deal with people living abroad.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on new houses and apartments bought for rent - could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury estimates that it could raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that non-UK residents buy 13 per cent of newly built flats in London, which drives up prices and makes it harder for people to buy their first home.
Many of the country's tourist areas - especially in the capital - are slums due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new plan came a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a stamp duty to help more young people have their first place of residence.
He accused large building societies of holding up housing prices by buying land and not using it and urged Mrs May to abolish quotas on affordable housing to address Britain's housing shortage.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of visionary recommendations on housing including rental control and an end to the eviction of innocent people.
It wants to give more powers to new housing councils.
Mrs May said: I said last year that my aim as prime minister was to redefine the British vision - that every new generation should have a better life.
And that includes fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live here.
It should not be as easy for non-UK residents, and for companies based abroad, to buy houses as it is for hardworking British residents.
For many, many people, the dream of owning their own homes is a long-term dream and sleeping outside is a shame.
Jack Ross: My last wish is not to be manager of Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his last wish was to manage Scotland at some point.
Jack is a 42-year-old Albanian who is enjoying a resurgence of the East Midlands club.
He moved to the Lightning during the summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
When I was a player I wanted to play for my country.
I was given a B cap and that was it. Ross told BBC Sportsbound in Scotland.
But when I was growing up my dad and I used to watch Scotland play at Hampden and it's always attracted me back.
I will not have that chance if I am not successful as a club manager.
Sunderland's previous managers included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ross was previously in charge of Alloa Athletic and said he had no qualms about meeting such big names at a big club and had turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My current measure of success is this club's return to the Premier League.
The structure and the resources of this club make it unquestionable that it should be in the Premier League, he said.
It is not an easy task but I would not call myself successful if I could not get it back then.
Ross spent just three years as manager, spending a spell as assistant manager with Dumbarton and 15 months on the Harts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa to come back from relegation and made such a transformation at St Mirren that they won the Championship the following season.
Ross says he is more comfortable now than he was playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably during the tribulation that he was referring to the taking of Alloa as his leader.
I really believed that a manager's job was the right job for me rather than a player's job.
It may seem strange to say this but I did quite well, had a fairly good entry and enjoyed some relatively high high highs.
But the life of a player can be difficult sometimes.
There are many, many things you have to do week after week.
I suffer from the stress and pressure of work but I feel that the manager's life is my life.
I always wanted to be my manager and since I have that job now my mind is more confused than it has been since I was a man.

5.30pm Saturday the perfect time for a penalty according to a survey
The summer heat wave is fuelling the influx of struggling British pubs but putting additional pressure on supply chains.
The figures showed a 2.7 per cent increase in the number of pubs but a 4.8 per cent decrease in the number of pubs.
Peter Martin from business consultancy CGA who compiled the figures said: The result of England's July participation in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected was a continuation of the July pattern when pub house income was 2.8 per cent higher but the penalties were even more severe.
The trade in the products fell by 1.8 per cent in June and was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinking fared much better and had worse-than-expected models.
The sun's heat knocked out the food-oriented taverns but did not have as dramatic an impact on them as it did on the inhabitants.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
During the month, sales of pubs and bars under management increased by 6.6 per cent and food sales decreased by 3 per cent.
This was what Paul Newman from RSM's leisure and leisure analytics said: These results have exceeded the trends we have been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major sporting and social events are the main factors for sales in the out-of-town market.
It is no wonder that groups of people are constantly struggling, and will find it very difficult to accept a 4.8% year-on-year fall due to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for those who want to sell food and we will see if the lower temperatures we had in August will provide relief to those who need it most.
Overall growth in pubs and printing houses, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the supply of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors sales in the pub, beer and spirits sector and analyses data from 47 working groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion.
One in five children has a secret social media account hidden from their parents.
A survey showed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have a secret social media account and keep it hidden from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake Instagram pages
This has increased the concern of people about posting sexual content
Twenty per cent of pupils reported having a 'main account' that they show to their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social account that they keep hidden from their parents.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake insta pages - a reference to the photo-sharing site instagram.
This has increased the concern about posting sexual material.
Twenty per cent of pupils said they had a 'main account' to show their parents and also had a private account.
A mother accidentally came across a secret site where her 13-year-old daughter was being attacked by a teenager.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Principals' Conference (IPSC) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and that half of those admitted to having private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanann said: It is worrying how so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces in places that parents and teachers cannot reach.
Eilidh Doyle will serve as the 'voice of the athletes' on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director on the Scottish Athletics board at the annual meeting of the governing board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie said the appointment was a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
Scotland is held in high esteem by Scottish, UK and world sports fans and we are sure it will go a long way to calm the athletics curriculum in Scotland, said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I am very keen to act as the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to do my own part in guiding sport in Scotland.
An American who was left unable to walk after suffering a temporary bout of blood restriction despite winning the 200 metres race and the 400 metres race at the 1996 Atlanta Games and having a total of four Olympic gold medals.
He wrote on Twitter: I've been gone a month today.
I couldn't walk
The doctors said that we should wait and see if I would get better and, if so, how much better.
It was a very hard day's work but I got the full throttle, I learned how to walk again and I'm doing a lot of drilling today!
Thank you for the inspirational message you sent me!
There are conflicting opinions online about the advertisement of breastfeeding mothers versus mothers who are breastfeeding.
A company offering bottles of breast milk has sparked an online controversy through its advertisement that puts women who are breastfeeding a baby in contrast to those who are breastfeeding.
On the occasion of the launch of the world's first portable breast pump, the technology company Elvie launched a semi-real music-inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom that the pump offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four mothers were dancing in a snow-filled pond and singing lyrics like: "Yes, I make my own creature but you don't see any tail" and "In case you didn't notice these are only my eyes".
It goes on to say: "Pumping out, pumping out, I'm feeding these kids. Pumping out, pumping out, I'm raising my wife".
The announcement was published on the company's Facebook page and sparked an online controversy.
Seventy-seven thousand people watched it and hundreds of references were made to it. There were different opinions about it, many of whom said that he ignored the "horrible aspects" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to use it to advertise the product wrote one person.
We are similar in that they need a bottle to take milk, but in those cases their babies are stolen from them a few days after birth.

Another wrote: "It is obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
Yes, but why not use them to advertise breastfeeding kits for mothers who can keep their babies?
And another wrote: "Here is the message. He was cut off from the world".
Others defended the advert and one woman admitted that she thought the song was always very funny.
I think it's a great plan.
I'd have one if I were still a milkmaid.
I just looked like a bowl when the pump was running.
The pass notice is a little dull but I took it on its own merit.
This product was created by a senior citizen, wrote another.
Another had this reference: This is a comedy ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in their workplaces or apartments) and feel like they are like ba.
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women indicate that they were dancing and the adult cuttings discreetly enter their terminal measures.
The campaign is based on the assumption that many women who pump their breasts consider themselves to be what they were.
The Elvie Cave is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes, sits discreetly within a fee-paying viewing area so that women can move around, hold their children and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood development consultant at Mother, had this to say: 'Elvie Castle is so revolutionary that it deserves a second, exciting address.
When we showed the relationship between women who are breastfeeding and dairy animals we wanted to draw attention to breastfeeding and all the challenges it brings, and to illustrate the incredible freedom of the new baby and do so in a fun way that people could talk about.
This was not the first time Elvie's casket had been in the news.
The mother of two walked down a mannequin platform during London Fashion Week using the product.
The First Migrant Children Quietly Cut to a Pub Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children arrested has increased significantly, although there has been little change in the number of people crossing the border, mainly because it is now more difficult to place children with traffickers due to Trump's tough policies and rhetoric.
What happened in the past is that they were undocumented immigrants who would have been sponsoring the immigrants but now they are afraid that they will risk their ability to stay in the country by applying to sponsor a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that would-be guardians and adults would have to provide their missing family members and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Authority, informed the Conference last week that the agency had seized the records of people who had been sent to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80 per cent of people who are their guardians, or members of their guardians' households, are in this country illegally, with a large proportion of them being criminal foreigners.
We are therefore always looking for such people", says Mr Albence.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of being arrested, instead of 60 days, which was previously the standard period, according to the homeworkers.
Many will present themselves by videoconference rather than in person, to demand an immigration judge to grant them legal status.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for relief shall be expelled from the country without delay.
According to firefighters and reports from the system in recent months, the length of time children are in custody is the most likely to cause anxiety or depression and lead to violent incidents or escape attempts.
Supporters said these concerns are being added in larger facilities like Tornillo that are so large that a struggling child will not be seen.
They also said that moving children to a pub without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or to leave them safe with their friends, could add to the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish forces to evacuate the country immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, announced that foreign forces in Syria are illegally fighting terrorism under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will be treated accordingly.
They must leave immediately without any conditions, he told the assembly.
Moualem announced that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to wage a blessed war until we clear terrorist groups and any illegal foreign forces from all Syrian territories.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria providing training and advice mostly to the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in that war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said conditions were favourable for their return and blamed some western countries for spreading unjustified concerns that encourage refugees to stay outside the country.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate his return, he said.
They are raising a political question which should be treated as a purely humanitarian question.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels, provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey ensured that Russian-backed Syrian forces would not launch a large-scale invasion of the country of three million people.
Moualem stressed however that the agreement had clear objectives and said he expected that during the war jihadists including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda would be targeted and eliminated.
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of the new committee, which will include government and opposition representatives to draft a constitution for Syria in time for the war to end and in preparation for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the committee's work should be limited to reviewing the current constitutional article, and urged people not to play their part in the story.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to these understandings Mr. Trump should win the 2020 election unless, as many liberals expect, a recession or scandal ends the presidency prematurely.
The coup was a tragedy for the presidency, then it would be no doubt!
There are currently no signs of the audience becoming tired of it.
CNN's prime-time ratings doubled to 1.05 million from 2014 and MSNBC's ratings nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers compared to 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with up to 3.5 million people watching major news nights.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because it is something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, who was showing ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", about a secretary of state who became president when Washington DC was attacked and destroyed.
Nell Schovell is a comedy writer who wrote "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, and has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
'Because he makes me laugh,' he said, 'that's what Mr Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in the order.
Of course, life is not like a TV show and the news from Washington could influence what happens next in the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the world economy.
It is the privilege of only the most tasteful people to turn off the television.
However, it's more than being a conscious citizen when you look at a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used his deep background as the source of his book, Man, or a pilot episode of his Australian version of the show that Paul Manafort bought for $15,000 (which the Washington Post said she was "on the verge of losing") or the implications of Stormy Daniels's portrayal of the Trump family.
For me, anyway, I'll never watch Super Mario the same way again.
"Some of what he's doing is making it look like one of those reality shows and bringing you something new every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast of Trump's show and the complexities it introduces into the plot (starting a fight with the N.F.L. or recommending Kim Jong-un).
You have to watch every single episode or you'll miss the plot.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's this week the sun was shining and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his residence on the upper Kauai waterfront but the guests inside were watching MSNBC and CNN recording.
He could not separate himself from television since Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's decision was between the two extremes.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy things and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just a joke but about how it happened they were right.

A flurry of cash is pouring in in the hottest midterm elections ever to the House of Representatives.
It is no wonder that a flood of money has been pouring into Pennsylvania's 17th district since the conference districts were re-arranged so that two elected congressmen are vying for the same seat.
A new boundary for the Pittsburg suburb area was designated so that Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election this spring spent
against incumbent Republican congressman Keith Rothfus who is the current representative of Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district which largely overlaps with 17th congressional district.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the anti-censorship measures were unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district began a round of trumpets between the party's main funders, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name has been in the public's mouth in Pennsylvania after he won a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March that was widely watched.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats are slightly ahead.
The US was considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China but withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing but Washington did little about it.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in July 2017 and they had a hotel in Panama until his partners ordered Trump Organization management to leave.
Heather Nauert, department spokeswoman said in a statement worthwhile this month that State Department officials decided to recall American diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan.
But no one was considered for punishment except the Salvadoran who received $140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug control aid as well as development and economic support.
Among the proposed penalties were cuts to financial aid, targeted visa restrictions that would severely impede this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings proceeded, officials from North and Central America held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to follow up on a similar meeting held last year and was considered a breakthrough in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
But senior administration officials indicated before mid-September that they wanted the conference to go ahead, which ended any plan to punish the Salvadoran.
Vice-President Mike Pence is due to address the conference in mid-November and diplomats say this shows that the administration considers the meeting to be very important.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any strong messages of sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to speak about the details of the controversy but described them to three American officials including two diplomats on condition of anonymity.
An external analyst supported the accounts they provided but spoke on condition that his or her name be withheld.
The study of history
The next hit could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on how Mr. Trump may have obstructed justice, and there is plenty of evidence in the public record to that effect.
There are reports that Mr. Mueller is also looking into whether Mr. Trump was working closely with Russia in their attack on our election.
If another party gains the upper hand in the US Congress, Mr Trump may have to account for what he has done in the face of those very circumstances when he goes before the voters and perhaps before a jury of his peers.
There is a lot of uncertainty about the story and I do not want to suggest that it is inevitable that Mr Trump will be put on the same level as anyone else in Europe.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the campaign continues.
German army officers were prepared to depose Hitler in 1938 if the West stood up to him and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that followed.
The course of history turns around such points and the slowing or accelerating of democracy will be put on hold.
America has to deal with a lot of those points now.
What if Mr. Trump gives a stick and a way to Deputy Major Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since a report in this newspaper last year that he was recording the president in a coma and exposing opinions that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account is inaccurate.
What if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be complete and unfair - or if he is reappointed as a Supreme Court justice despite credible allegations of sexual assault and testimony of abuse?
And above all else will we vote in the midterm elections for the United States Congress that will determine that Mr. Trump must be held accountable for what he has done?
If we fail in these tests, a long and bitter winter will be upon democracy.
I believe we will not fail the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother is a Czechoslovak Jew and is deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that took her over during her diplomatic stay.
She survived, emigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to a Saturday church on that burning board with the swastika on it.
If that is our heritage, how can I not have hope for what lies ahead?

Graham Dorrans hopeful about the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host the match against Rapid Vienna on Thursday. Rangers did very well when they finished tied against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month and if they beat Rapid Vienna they will have a chance to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
Graham Dorrans suffered a knee injury and was unable to play his first game of the season until the match against Villarreal which ended in a 2-2 draw. However, he believes that Rangers can use that result to achieve better things.
"We want that because Villarreal are a lovely team", says 31-year-old Graham.
We went into the game expecting to get an advantage and got a point.
We may be able to win in the end but, overall, a draw is a good result.
They were probably more manly in the first half but we improved in the second half and we were better than them.
As for Thursday, it will be a big European night.
I hope we manage to get three points but it will be a tough game as they had a good result in their last game, but with the support of the crowd, I am sure we can push forward and get a positive result.
We certainly had a difficult year last year, with the injuries I suffered and the changes that have taken place at the club itself but we feel that everything is fine now.
The squash is good and the boys are enjoying it very much; the training is good.
I hope we can now press on, this season of our lives being spent and be confident.
Women losing sleep at night because of retirement savings concerns
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people in a Nationwide study said that they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
People want to be cared for by a family member but they are doing nothing to talk to them about it, said Holly Snyder, vice-president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is the place to start.
You cannot prepare your children to provide care if you do not tell them well in advance what you want.
Work with your counsellor and your children to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for as this can have a significant impact on the cost.
Ask your financial adviser for advice: The adviser may suggest ways for you to pay for these costs.
Long-term care options could include the following - a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value policy to help you pay for these costs, or self-insurance from your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Declare your legal documents: Avoid legal situations before they begin.
Appoint a healthcare professional to act on your behalf so that you can appoint someone you trust or a nurse to look after your medical care and to ensure that professionals meet your requirements in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider giving someone a power of attorney for your money matters.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you become disabled.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about pharmaceuticals and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are prepared.
It is not just about the money, but who are the doctors? said Martin.
What are the pharmaceutical ranges?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready.
Frequent shooting of man with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was often shot with an air rifle while walking home after a night on the canons.
The victim is in his teens and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the thigh, stomach and arm.
Officials described the shooting as having occurred at around 02:30 GMT and said it was a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
He was not seriously injured and the police asked for witnesses to speak with him.
Landforms and demolitions in Indonesia
Officials say at least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise.
Communication systems are destroyed and emergency officials are unable to obtain any information from Donggala regency, which is located north of Palu and closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, it is located at the end of a desert bay on the east coast of Sulawesi island and was estimated to have 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a peninsula that extends more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast of the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
A vice-state is an administrative region of less than five and was estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi is mainly based on fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but most of it is done in Morowali on the other coast off Sulawesi.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala frequently in the past 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 tsunamis killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunamis struck western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ocean's Valley of Fire seismic zone and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggering tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast and half of them died in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered tsunamis up to 10 meters high that destroyed village shores and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya vice-state in Aceh, damaging and devastating the memory of the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was initiated at the time but over 100 people were killed when buildings fell to the ground.
2018: Earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok killing over 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes he took his phone away from her.
According to a KTUU report, Palin has been transferred to Mat-Su Pre-Regional Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond.
According to the network when he appeared in court on Saturday and was asked what he was arguing about he answered "not guilty, definitely yes".
Palin is facing three class A misdemeanors, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanor, which means he could face up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
He was charged in December 2017 with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing the reporting of a crime of domestic violence, possession of a weapon while under the influence of a substance in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend complained that he had stabbed her in the clothes.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 because she suggested that her sons' violent behavior stemmed from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of dead from landslides and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died as a result of a landslide that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications systems have been damaged and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck shortly after mid-Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are being shared on social media showing the moment the earthquake began.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Pau when the demon entered them.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of carrying out the terror attack that killed eight people, be sentenced to death, a rare sentence that has not been imposed on anyone in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is alleged that 30-year-old Saipov used trucks rented from Home Depot to attack a bike range along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and previously hit pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims in one go and caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are potentially punishable by death, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of camaraderie, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "a great deal of planning and premeditation" and said Saipov carried it out in a "grave, cruel and coercive manner".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was responsible for injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", specified in the confidential notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been about ten years since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a stillbirth case.
The defendant was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during World War Two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the citation.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
We believe the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea for a life sentence would leave no possibility of prolonging the trauma of these events for all those involved, said Patton.
Saipov's defense team asked former prosecutors not to seek the death penalty
MEPs say Nigel FARAGE should lead the negotiations on Brexit
Nigel Farage pledged to march on the people today in a protest at the Tory conference.
Former Ukip leader said politicians needed to be under pressure from the EU - and one of her own MEPs Theresa May suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative prime minister Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK would be gone now if Mr Farage became British Secretary of State.
But the challenge facing Mrs May is highlighted as she seeks to bring her split-party peers together and to remain a Tory after taking part in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has a hard time keeping his Chequers transition plan on track when Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU are under attack.
Its supporters have declared that it will continue to seek market access with Brussels despite the backlash - and that it will force MEPs to choose between its own package and a "slam dunk".
The Master said. Bone at the lock means Event Event in Solihull that he was trying to throw out Chequers.
He suggested that it was right to make Mr Farage a peer and put him in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be gone now", he said.
Wellingborough MP also said: I will stand for Brexit but we need to throw out Chequers.
Explaining the reasons for his anti-EU stance, he said: We did not fight world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people have changed their minds is that they want to stay out of the lies.
Tory British supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also present at the march, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public is not happy with Chequers, the opposition is not happy to vote for him, our party and activists who are taking to the streets and getting votes for us first are not happy with him.
I ask you to throw out Chequers and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, she also said: Chief Ministers keep their posts when they give their word.
Mr Farage said at the launch that politicians needed to be pressured if they were to abandon the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class, he said.
"We are here today to tell you that you will not tolerate this people's rebellion.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he also said: I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is about to abandon the British.
We are going to march with the people's army of this country that won us the war in Britain and we will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remain supporters marched through Birmingham before they ran a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
A number of activists were in the midst of a violent anti-Brexit rally after the group was launched this weekend.
The peerage of Lord Adonis's Labourers was mocking the Conservatives for the security difficulties they had with a party application as the conference was beginning.
These are the people who tell us that they can apply IT systems and all the technology to Canada and beyond, for a borderless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland, he also said.
A such a amends.
There is no such thing as a good look, he said.
Warren intends to closely monitor his presidential campaign.
S.A.M. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she is going to "closely consider standing in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican state Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
Many said she might run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters and used the home hall meeting format since Trump began his term in office.
One of the attendants asked her if she intended to stand in the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top.
Man arrested after dead Sims was released from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in connection with the Friday death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at a conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the release on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the film's footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and was released by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, having a weapon, and admitting to releasing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without difficulty and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nearing the world tree after the team orders him to award the victory against Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it was clear that Mercedes team orders would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the empty beach after defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel entered the stands first and let Hamilton hit the traffic at the back of the pack, something that was bound to have a major impact on matters.
The Mercedes went to the pit stop one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action after the Ferrari driver left the interior free to the risk of stopping the fold after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race while holding on to his base to focus on a fast finish and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the stands on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen built up fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has been working hard all weekend and he's a gentleman in that he let me over.
The team has done a great job and they are one of a kind", said Hamilton.
The Horrible Body Signal of the Past
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday after she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she sexually assaulted Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "machine and hateful and false".
The only thing that can happen is the beautiful thing that has been happening in the last few days in Seanad, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and rude and hateful and lying, he said.
When you look at the news about the release and the leak and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you run away?
Remember his answer... you leaked his paper-- Oh, oh, what?
Oh, it did not leak.
I didn't run away.
Well, wait a minute.
We ran away...No, we didn't run away, he also said, blaming the old man.
A letter to Feinstein detailing Kavanaugh's allegations at Ford was sent in late July, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his own office.
"I did not deny Dr Ford's allegations, I did not leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, reported in The Hill.
She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as she asked.
But the president seemed unwilling to deny it, saying during a Saturday night parade: "I'll tell you the truth, there was a terrible body sign.
Maybe she did, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Following his defence of the nominee to the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations on his behalf.
They are determined to take back power, one way or another.
You see the arrogance, the hatred, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to put under their feet to get power and control", the president said according to a Media report.
The best of the best: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two backs for the Giants against Dundee
He made enough of an impact in the Premier League loss on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 replay in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led by two runs early in the game after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home side to a tie before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before his victory was over by two laps from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Premier League for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to take a 2-1 win over Dundee at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the teams, and the Giants' first win in the previous three games.
Dwyer's first back came in the fourth minute at 3:35 and had help from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping Beauvillier get the team's second back four minutes later.
During a very busy opening period, Sullivan took the home side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the score for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants had the lead before the first half before scoring his second back of the night late in the first period.
The home side re-arranged themselves and again Bouchard scored them with an all-out attack at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the first-ever lead of the game in the second-to-last period and ensured that they would win with their team's fifth halfback through the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller gets killed to make sure first people on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday triggering tsunamis.
The area is still being hit by strong currents and many people are stranded in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing with their souls, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly shaking control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was en route at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported in Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him in the morning before the Palu helicopter arrived.
Our hearts are broken to hear about this, he also said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear thousands may have died and the country's disaster mitigation agency says an entry into the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
The death toll is still expected to rise as many bodies remained under the rubble as not enough had been reached, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Palu is destroyed by waves reaching up to six meters and mass worship will take place there on Sunday.
Military and business aircraft are building in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a car takes a toll on a body.
There is a shortage of clean water.
The small markets are crowded everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the people who survive but don't know what they will find there.
It is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palu on Sunday and told the nation's mourning: I want you all to work day and night to do all the work related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Niugini says one man is now missing after plane crash in Morocco
The airline that was operating a flight into a Pacific Ocean shallow in Micronesia says one man is missing, having earlier said all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon no male passengers had been found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, a hospital and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not directly respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to evacuate the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all of them standing.
It is still unclear what was responsible for the fall and what exactly fell out.
Both the airline and the S.A.M. Fleet said the plane landed in the marsh just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane went over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's a wonderful thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to splash through water to the escape routes on the sunken plane.
He said that the flight attendants were paralyzed and were cycling and that he suffered minor head injuries.
The S.A.M. Navy said that sailors working nearby helped to improve the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to the beach before the plane plunged into about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in crashes at PNG-registered airlines over the past twenty years but none of them involved Air Niugini.
An analyst determines the time of night a woman would be burned alive.
Her case was made by prosecutors on Saturday in the trial of men accused of burning women from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analyst from the Department of Justice S.A.M. Paul Rowlett testified for many hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He gave an account to the jury of how he used cellphone records to piece together a story about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, which contradicted his previous denials, reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not at home that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about a dozen years before she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers's messages, calls and contact details from his phone sometime after Chambers died.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defence is set to make its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hap consciousness?
The hip hop trio is trying to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol, claims hip hop has moved away from its roots as political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and have a hip hop consciousness again.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Common have re-emerged in the UK through the weight of musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another blue guy?!
New York City child pornography court challenges law after couple gets hit by a racist text message
A New York child is awaiting legal action against a couple for discriminationally dismissing her from her job after she received a misdirected text message from her mother complaining that she was "another blue person".
The couple deny being racist, and compare the legal situation to a strike.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two expressed disappointment when she found out that the new baby-sitter, Giselle Maurice, was blue when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
From MY GOD, ANOTHER GREAT MAN, written by Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Ms Maurice twice.
After realizing she had made a mistake, Plasco-Flaxman gave Ms Maurice an uncomfortable, stick and road, saying her outgoing foster mother was African-American and was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for the day's work and then sent home for Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for firing her, and she is seeking compensation equal to $350 a day for the six-month residential position she was employed in, despite not being offered a contract.
I want to make it clear to them, look, you shouldn't do things like that, she told the Post on Friday, adding I know it's discrimination.
The couple have responded to the claim of being racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was reasonable, and they feared they could not be trusted after disturbing her.
My wife sent you something she didn't mean to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racists", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But have you ever left your children in the care of someone you were abusive to, even if you did so by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Listen now!
Plasco compared the legal situation to "employment" saying that his wife was expecting a child in two months and was "pregnant".
Are you going to hunt for someone like that?
That is not a nice thing to do", said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public has not hesitated to criticize the couple on social media, and they have been criticized for their behavior and logic.
A new letter revealed that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not understand a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: It is hard to imagine that you were someone who was reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's funny now that we know Paddington has done well.
Noting that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being encouraged by small titles to write a children's book, would be positive despite his work being rejected, she also said that "joy and sorrow" were associated with a fair celebration of 60 years since the book's publication after he died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important family member", she said her father was proud of his success in the end without being overly optimistic about it.
"He was a quiet man, and he was bragging about himself", she said.
But since Paddington was such a real man to him, it was almost like having a kid who does well: you're proud of an act even though you didn't make the bet.
I suppose that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Although he created and dreamed it himself, he always gave the recognition to Paddington himself.
My baby was dying and I was safe on the phone.
After landing her daughter was quickly taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked free of charge to save her life.
"Nada called me regularly to say that it was very bad, that she was not expected to be safe", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within two minutes and I had to tell her goodbye.
And I said goodbye to her.
I said, Tashi, I'm glad you are, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were leaving her system early and leaving her system.
She died some time before and now everything was shutting down.
I had just been sitting there, and I knew this was falling out.
I could not bike, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by children and large crowds.
I had to keep my cool.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, devastated by her daughter's death, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of her heart attack.
"We didn't know", she said.
I had my head down and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain but when I was on the plane I felt deeply sorry for Nad.
That was my love and understanding of him.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women in the Bronx post suicide prevention cards on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to keep others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and numbers for people to call for support.
Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef and that his approach had been misinterpreted by others.
Everyone knew him because of his weight.
They always ended up burning any room with their means.
However, he resigned from his post before his death, as he was in a very bad place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, succeeded his brother after he handled his own death.
Ms Davis said: I am always worried that this will affect him.
Ms Davis created the cards, so that people know that there are people they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stand in your way - if you need to talk.
Ms Humphreys, a friend of Ms Davies's for many years, lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, soon after her mother's death.
He didn't say he was low or depressed or anything,she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the Christmas tree - when the children opened their gifts he didn't look at them or anything.
She said that he was in great pain to die, but they had to answer him: "He tears the children apart.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to keep going and keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake and the FBI has begun an investigation.
I thought, if we could really get something like what he wanted - a limited investigation in terms of time, in terms of scope - we might have a consensus, said Mr Flake on Saturday, also saying he was afraid the committee was collapsing with a tightly-knit group.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It is a matter of time before they are drunk.
There are only 5 weeks left until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if the Republicans do poorly, as expected, they will be much weaker in their bid to get their man elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is on the phone calling Senators and asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after his report is made by the FBI?
A vote is required in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to secure at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of people who back North Korea is declining under Kim.
The number of people who turned away from North Korea to go to South Korea has declined at least since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unified ministry, said 1,127 people fled to North Korea last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates of smuggling were key factors, Mr Park said.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
South Korean citizenship is eventually offered to most people who turn their backs on North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flow through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers those who turn their backs on North Korea to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their own country.
Relations between North and South Korea - still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the unresolved nuclear disarmament talks.
This followed historic meetings in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a general way to work towards the Korean Peninsula as a nuclear-weapon-free place.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on US sanctions.
If the US is not trusted, our national security will be uncertain and, for these reasons, there is no way we will disarm ourselves first on our own soil, said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "unfit" to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was "incompetent" and financially unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the traffic interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I have to think if it was a woman who did that, they would be 'white,'" Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the two teenagers.
During his opening statements, Kavanaugh was very vocal, almost bicycling and sometimes talking his way out of the conversation while talking about his children and his time in high school.
He has openly criticized the committee by Democrats, giving "a harsh and coordinated" treatment of the allegations against him and organized by liberals angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's evidence established that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as he showed an anti-Democratic bias.
I think he is disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he has gone about getting the popularity of the Clintons and the Democrats, she said.
When asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, she declined.
I will say this - if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be not only on the Supreme Court but to be on the court where he is now, said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's potential controls against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a foolish, inclined person to go to court and expect us to do something not so great", said Pelosi.
And not great for women to conceive.
It is a just regime, the months and years of anger are being released, and she cannot let it out without crying.
We cry when we are angry, Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's a strange thing, do you?
She continued, A woman who was an executive somewhere helped me a lot, saying that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, Maybe I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry with you.
And then she followed her.
And I thought that was great.
Tears are allowed as a way to release anger because they are basically not understood.
One of my most vivid memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with rage I couldn't express, an older woman grabbing me by the back of the neck - a demanding manager who I was always afraid to approach - and dragging me into a stairwell.
"Don't let them ever see you cry", she told me.
You don't know you're drunk.
They will mourn for you and be glad because they mourned for you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart while he was running for president.
In 1987, when it was revealed that Mr. Hart was having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and that he had left the race, Ms. Schroeder, very frustrated, decided that she should consider running for the presidency herself.
It was not a stupid decision, she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they had was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because he was last in the campaign, she was behind in terms of raising money and so she promised not to go in the race unless she raised $2 million.
There was free work.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she asked herself.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so excited - thanking the people who supported her, frustration with the system for being so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than deputies, and anger at sexism - that she became passionate.
You would think I had a nervous breakdown, Ms Schroeder recalled in relation to the media response to her.
You'd think Kleenex was a corporate asset to me.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my grave leak?
She cried?
Why the US-China trade war might be good for Beijing
Opening the door to a US-China trade war would be dangerous, and while the war is by no means over, Beijing could benefit in the long term from a dispute between the countries, experts say.
Donald Trump, US President, issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on China's core exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The significant tightening came this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), which meant that almost half of all goods imported into the US from China have been taxed.
Besing retaliates in the same way each time, with the latest act being to impose tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the US head-on, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to be compromised anytime soon.
If Washington were to be seen to be backing down, it would be necessary to surrender to their demands, but the embarrassment for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, would be too great if he publicly blamed the US.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the pressure from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger an economic failure in either country is actually far more dangerous than previous observers have acknowledged, said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria  ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return and is seeking help to rebuild the country after it was devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
Today, the world is much more stable and resilient thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is still reforming the areas destroyed by terrorists to get things back to normal.
The conditions for voluntary return to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures have now been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But it made clear that it would not accept aid or conditional assistance from countries that had endured the withdrawal.
Europe is the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
Now the USA have lost six times in a row on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Denmark captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to take the best over the United States.
USA star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, threw his thumb into the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving up the game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian goalkeeper made the move in every round, and is one of four players to have never gone 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated at 5&4 by the lowest-placed player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The highest-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, was the most successful European in the tournament with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't normally cry but I don't have the strength today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting us.
I am glad to have the crown back.
The team is the most important thing and I am glad that I was able to help them", said Garcia, excited after the European victory.
John Ram, who won 2&1 over US golfer Tiger Woods in singles on Sunday, will be in his place.
I am very proud of the victory against Tiger Woods, I watched that man grow down, said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches he played in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's an odd statistic for one of the greatest players ever, and he's won 14 major championships, and Jack Nicklaus just ahead.
The US team struggled to find the blanks throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team had played in his disappointing autumn, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
Some mornings we thought we had put pressure on Europe.
We fought.
A compliment is going to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players play very well.
We'll reorganize ourselves, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I am happy to have these 12 men and proud to be my captain.
You must congratulate me.
The other team is playing better than us.
