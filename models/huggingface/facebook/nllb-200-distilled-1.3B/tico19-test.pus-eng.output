Total cases of rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The overall coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases show similar occurrence in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, while at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, countries, hospitals and care unit units should increase their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of cyniumonia of unknown etology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 20 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the novel coronavirus as a reporting agent now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have less disease, e.g. shortness of breath from pneumonia or no pneumonia, and most are healthy.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a very serious illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases experience a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the total incidence of COVID-19 cases in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom and compared it to Hubei Province, China.
We compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EV/EEA countries and the UK in Italy during 31 January 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in England and EU/EEA countries
After China, COVID-19 spread geographically and the COVID-19 epidemic is now dynamically following the country in the rest of the world.
On 11 March 2020, the President-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 disease a global pandemic.
On 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. in EuroSurveillance 2020, reported the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Hubei, China, and Wuhan, France.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, while between 31 December 2019 and this date there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone out of 17,750 cases.
Total number of COVID-19 cases and accumulated incidence
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the confirmed case of COVID-19 is counted in every country in the world, only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) published daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 incidence in the EU/EEA and the UK, and it was compared to Italy.
As an indication of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day decreased total incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 during the period 1 January  15 March 2020 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom.
We presented the total number of confirmed cases per country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the UK and EU/EEA countries
The trend in 14 days was followed by higher incidence of COVID-19 cases in EV/EEA countries and the UK, generally followed by Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the total number of COVID-19 cases began to rise around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (additional items).
This was mostly due to a rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similarly increasing trend in overall COVID-19 (complementary) cases.
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EV/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to those in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
This indicates that, as of 8am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported similar cases with Italy only 3 weeks or less earlier.
Our results show that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The intensity observed in the overall incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the epidemic is progressing comparatively well in all countries.
Despite countries being at different stages, differences in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions across countries, different protocols for selecting and following up on patients who should be tested for COVID-19 are in place.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data entry records on COVID-19 cases in hospital and/or intensive care unit are currently only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively at EU/EEA level (data not shown).
However, they should be systematically compiled to complement current surveillance documentation/records focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, with 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (in 2010-12 the number of care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population is 12.5).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity centralization, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK hospitals showing a risk of COVID-19 cases exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds by >90%, are presented in the Sixth ECDC COVID-19 Emergency Risk Assessment.
As cases have so far been clustered in some regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and care unit units usually determine a regional catchment population, data on cases and care beds should preferably be provided in the name of the area unit for the statistical 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Our experience from Italy shows that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and care units should thus prepare themselves for the healthcare to continue the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, which will require them to be treated with healthcare, and especially intensive care, as is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the projected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to plan, adopt and implement their own reflective action if not implemented early.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the disease to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity while countries are likely to step up their containment efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce healthcare stress.
Failing this, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may be spread by evening primates and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS but is more transmissible and affects older individuals than younger individuals and more men than women.
In response to the rapid number of publications on chronic disease, this paper attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of a rapidly growing topic of research.
We will cover the basics of disease prevention, ethnography, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate the threatening disease.
The January 25, 2020 Spring Festival became a memorable and unforgettable reminder for all Chinese who have been asked to stay indoors for the entire holiday and several weeks due to the outbreak of the new epidemic.
The coronavirus (CoV) is highly homologous to the one that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The disease began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 50 other countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has produced more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "class 1 enemy of the people" and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), in less than two months more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology epidemiology, etology, diagnosis, and treatment.Since the first report on 7 January 2020 that the virus sequence was determined, several patients had been isolated.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in this new and rapidly growing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and another CoV-induced disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).
We will also discuss the prevention and diagnosis of this disease and some of the immediate questions we have learned so far.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-fatal viruses to humans, typically causing 15% of the common cold [4].
However, in this century, we have twice been exposed to highly pathogenic human CoVs, for example, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which in fact caused an outbreak first in 2003 in China and then in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and soon spread the disease and death to many other countries with fear.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third major outbreak of CoV in human/humanity recorded history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019.
Seven (7) days later the CoV sequence spread.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
At the same time, the disease spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, health care providers reported infection, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was closed with all public transportation shut down.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of the outbreak from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared it a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread in China and had spread to about 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig. 2) 2).
As the situation develops rapidly, the ultimate scope and intensity of the outbreak will become even more definite.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a new updated diagnosis of the disease as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ULBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but most are between 30-65 years old.
About half (47.7%) of infected individuals were over 50 years of age, a very small number were under 20, and only 14 of the infected patients were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.27/100,000) than women (0.31/100.000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in clusters in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial fertility count (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases increased unprecedentedly before January 23, 2020, compared to the time of the major outbreak before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10-1.86), and the mortality of all patients was 3.06 (59% 4-02.2 : 95% CI).
The three risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60), and severe asthma.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and covert viruses that have a sensory RNA unit.
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, from which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The spike-pack (S) glycoprotein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of these cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and subsequent membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome is re-assembled, genomic RNA forms vesicles containing virions with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then intercept with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was detected as a new variant of Beta CoV with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 percent among 10 sequenced samples collected from the Huan'an Marine Market in Wuhan, the main site of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MAR-CoV.
Through transcriptional balectrian microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the ultrasonic portions of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be receptors for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 much more weakly than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form unknown short proteins that are transmitted via orf3b and orf8 excretions.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and take the form of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known active domain or form.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the structure of the full-length human ACE2 cryo-EM at 2.9 Å contraction in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conditions, is assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for drug trials to bury SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Source and intermediate host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from evening primates and were transmitted to humans through cats and camels, respectively.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the evening was apparently the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs identified as -SL-CoVZX45. bat - SL-CoVZX21
However, what intermediate hosts helped the virus to overcome the species barriers to infection in humans, and the route of transmission, remain unclear.
J, et al., suggested that snakes were carriers of viruses from evening primates to humans which were involved in homologous group within the S protein.
Based on a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that penguins - long-beaked, honey-eating tear-dropped animals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on the 99% genetic homology in the CoV found in penguins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in the spread of the two genomes is still a large difference; thus, the results of the true and accurate evidence are pending (Fig. (Fig. .33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and can remain at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperatures at 56 °C for 30 minutes; or 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing, disinfectant, parasitic acid, chloroform and other solvents, but chloroxide cannot effectively inactivate this virus.
The entire human population is generally not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to this unknown virus.
Currently, no detailed studies on immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4) 4).
Generally, after the virus attacks the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, total receptor TLR (NOD) -like receptors (NLR), and - (RLR).
In a variety of ways, the virus induces a combination of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell proliferation, and type I interferons (IFNs) that limit viral spread and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein may help prevent the virus from escaping immune responses.
Soon, the immune adaptive response is being integrated into the fight against the virus.
T4 lymphocytes play an important role in the defense of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, including T4 lymphocytes.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to aid immune cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Neuronal immunity supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also essential against viral infection.
For example, the antibodies of a recovered patient replace MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overworked immune system produces locally large radicals that can severely damage the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, cause multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 disease, which started with a cluster set, is more likely to affect older people, pregnant women.
It is normal for people who are infected with a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised, to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most 3-7 days based on preliminary studies of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the contraction period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is critical for health authorities to set effective quarantine times based on the effective time of the period, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected but asymptomatic people to others.
As a general practice, individuals who have been exposed to or have been infected with the disease are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the major and primary symptom of COVID-19, which may be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle/muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nausea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea/diarrhea.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have rapidly progressed to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for pertussis, and 3% for diarrhea.8% of patients needed fresh air.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of familial cluster and cluster caused by transmission from non-muscle disease.
Relatively, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of these require respiratory support, corresponding to more COVID-19 patients and higher mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and neck pain (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was found that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25), and neck pain (1%3-25) were major symptoms and fresh air was required for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
On 14 February, COVID-19 deaths were 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
Relatively, SARS deaths in November 2002 were 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% CI of 5.71-7.23, whereas SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality, and R0 are presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Thus, disease control of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster initiation often occurs in the same family or in the same meeting or car as on a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or two weeks prior to contact with infected individuals or patients.
However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and patients discharged from hospitals can re-transmit the virus, which has led to the need to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or low white blood cell count (especially lymphomas) in the early stages.
For example, lymphocytic leukemia with a white blood cell count <4 × 109 / L, lymphase count 1 × 109 / L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferases and veramias were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The liver/blood and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels in the blood of liver patients were elevated, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte degradation were increased in the blood of many patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, is elevated, and the lymphocyte count gradually decreases.
Abnormalities in chest radiography have been found in many COVID-19 patients and are obscured by double-patch shadows or opacity of ground appearance in the lungs.
Patients often develop a nervous chest, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, irregularly controlled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and advanced fibrosis damage the gas exchange.
Type I and type II pattern disorders cause decreased surfactant levels and increased surface tension, thereby reducing lung capacity and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the chest radiographic findings of poor chest radiography often parallel the more severe extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 showed that the pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphatic infiltration, and multiple infected synucetal cells were in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, according to a pathology similar to that of viral infection and ARDS and SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain interaction (RT-PCR) was used as a major criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which may accelerate the disease, clinical manifestations used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) were used in China on February 13, 2020.
The same thing happened with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings are essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in 200 to 20 × 10-18 mol/L. -18 10-18 mol/L (up to 10-100 copies per microcontroller of the Internet) in less than an hour without the need for a detection device.
Hopefully, the new technique could dramatically improve sensitivity and ease if validated in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with unknown CoVs, physicians can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients while trying different therapies that have already been used or recommended to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential therapies including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Plasma from even the recipient patients was suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory disease and failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is important for reducing symptoms and saving lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, faultless ventilation, and depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a cardiac stabilization technique used to treat life-threatening heart and shortness of breath.
In addition, maintaining electrical balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and maintenance of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytocoin storm results from overactivity of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytocine storm is part of a systemic inflammatory response released by a series of cytocines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunization is essential in the treatment of cytokine seizures, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tucelazoumab, an antibody to IL6, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunotherapies for cytokine storm include modification of immune response directed by T cells; inhibitors of IFN-the, IL-1, and TNF; inhibitors of JAK; blinatumomab; inhibitors of cytothin signaling factor 4 and HDAC.
Steroids, as an immunosuppressant, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of the burns.
However, steroids at higher doses were not useful for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause serious side effects, particularly avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting prognosis.
However, short courses of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids are recommended to be used with caution for severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially to treat illnesses caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Subsequently, the observations also showed possible inhibition of other single-infected RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided a facility to China to conduct this pair of tests on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are highly predictable.
In addition, baricetinib, intriron α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, inflammation, cough, liver damage, and other adverse interactions may occur after co-treatment with lopinavir/retonavir.
The interaction of these drugs with other medications used for patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma was made from acquired patients and antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have emerged from an infectious disease to treat other patients susceptible to the same disease or to prevent disease in healthy individuals has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the disease in their blood.
Antibodies are an immune response produced by B lymphocytes to fight off disease and other foreign agents and to recognize and directly neutralize specific molecules in such diseases.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with decreased inflammatory and viral pressures and increased oxygen concentration in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed before specific treatments are yet developed to suggest a method for large-scale use.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effects, some of the risks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can enhance immune responses and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat serious patients.
Rapid production of specific antibodies to fight a global pandemic is very expensive.
Thus, it is very critical and practical to isolate B cells from infected cells and identify effective antibodies or test-codes or genetic codes against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a range of ailments.
However, its effectiveness largely depends on the combination of many components in the formula that depends on the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Many effective ingredients remain unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and validate such ingredients or their best combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the major alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shen Feng Zhi Du capsules and Lian Hu Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for treating COVID-19.
The best treatment rates for COVID-19 patients were seen in several provinces in China where TCM was used in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningya (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest treatment rate (13%).
However, this is somewhat comparative as many other impact factors such as number of patients and severity must be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boley Zhang and colleagues published a study to compare Western Medicine (WM) therapy alone with combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the times required for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance, and hospitalization were much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most significantly, the rate of symptom worsening (light to severe) was significantly lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM-only group than in the WM+TCM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still awaiting well-controlled trials on large scales and in other centers.
It would be useful to determine the mechanism of action and identify the effective components of TCM therapies or their combinations where possible.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience a greater fear of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in quarantine also experience fatigue, loneliness, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of illness such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, a range of psychiatric disorders including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, psychotic symptoms, heartburn, and even suicide were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause people to become more concerned and guilty about the effects of infectious disease, quarantine, and stigma on family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, and people in contact with them as well as the general public who need it.
Mental support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with one another.
Effective vaccines are necessary to intervene in the transmission chain from animal populations and infected humans to infected organisms and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling disease caused by viruses.
Efforts have been initiated to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-lasting and potent neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-fed vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and in life-threatening models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection were still to be determined before clinical studies could begin.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have emerged since then.
In contrast, MERS-type cases and clusters occur in the Middle East and have spread to other regions with unusual areas of continuing zoonogenic outbreaks.
A vaccination strategy has been developed for Mers using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vitraces, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and reproducible protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
In any case, it is a challenge to overcome the problems as long time (on average 18 months) is required for vaccine development and for the dynamic mutations of CoVs.
As a malignant disease, COVID-19 has only begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without a seizure.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.
Therefore, developing a diagnostic model for the disease is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may be associated with or influence the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS diagnosis, which is also important for COVID-19.
COVID-19 generally develops in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of patients aged 50 and over in the study of 8,866 cases.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have disorders and disorders and were significantly older than those aged 66-51 with an average age of no more than five years, suggesting age as a prognostic factor for outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Disorders and disorders: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to develop severe heart disease and arrhythmia.
Heart attack was also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause renal/hepatic impairment in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been suggested as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
A correlation of CRV levels with COVID-19 severity and diagnosis has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated LDH, aspartate aminotransferases (AST), alanine aminotransferases (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in organs, particularly in the heart and kidney/liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or renal/hepatic inactivity.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and the short-term progression of clinical symptoms should be considered, among other issues, for prediction and complexity of COVID-19 outcomes.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are an immunosuppressant used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors have developed esophageal osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As noted above, many patients have experienced unusual stress during the COVID-19 pandemic as they often endured confinement and prolonged uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and friends.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively induce a reaction in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomatic symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or incubation period can develop large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which creates a major difficulty for disease control.
However, SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are very seriously ill, while most transmissions do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Major efforts are currently underway in China, including the ongoing quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities and almost the entire population, to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have dramatically damaged the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is declining, reflecting the slowdown in the outbreak.
The most optimistic forecast is that the epidemic will end in March and the downward phase will continue for 3-4 months.
Still, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini, et al., developed a model to predict outcomes of the disease and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both moderate turbinitis and spinal fluid in patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be a flu-like cyclical event.
However, promising signs have emerged based on the declining number of new cases in China, suggesting that current strategies may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in infection and eventually die or remain a less pathogenic virus shared with humans.
Comparison of COVID-19 infection with SVS and Mers provided below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible through coughing or bronchial/cold, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in human feces, which raises a new possibility of oral-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by potentially non-communicable diseases, including 17 more patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
Thus, human beings must be protected with extreme caution, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even those in contact with sick or infected individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing a face mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
A surgical face mask prevents fluid droplets from a potentially infected limb from traveling through the air or entering the surfaces of the material, where they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 (series #1860s) masks can protect against respiration of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can fit into up to five surgical masks at once, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series #1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear fibre-insulated clothing to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his burning eyes.
Thus, health care providers should also wear transparent face coverings or glasses when working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash themselves with pesticide soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors to protect themselves and limit contact with potentially ill people.
A distance of three steps/step away from the patient is considered the appropriate distance for people.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a novel virus, its superhuman homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 must have been due to its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003 which caused high alert to China.
However, as of January 2020, the director of disease control in Wuhan City reassures citizens that the novel virus has a low human-to-human transmission and limited proportions and that it is not a problem for disease prevention and control.
The message calmly eased public anxiety, especially as the entire country prepares for the Spring Festival, and missed important time to contain the outbreak, at least in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may learn this hard lesson and make important reforms in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word has value to the public and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorities; (3) be more restrained in initially giving people relief rather than being too restrictive in having a potential illness; and (4) frequently deploy targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of infectious diseases and periodically evaluate and improve the community response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 that began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread to China and some 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the emergence of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS replication.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the treatment of the disease and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals than younger individuals and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older individuals than younger individuals.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have symptoms whereas SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, which poses a much greater problem in the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assays for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients may again be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like co-CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from co-CoVs.
Which animal was the medium-sized animal that transmitted the virus from the original host to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the numbers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively slow down transmission, and these events can reoccur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical transcription have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter air cells and subsequently cause pathogenic mutations?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the disease last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?
Will it be global, die out like SARS or emerge at the same time as the flu?
This is essential but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, at whatever cost it may demand, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Zoonotic origin/sources of human coronaviruses
Mutations and adaptations have co-existed for thousands of years between coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human HCoVs were known to cause infectious disease, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have been coin-plated to illustrate how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 brought CoVs back into the spotlight and surprised us with its high transmissibility but low morbidity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
The HCoV infection is zoonoses and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will serve us well.
Most HCoVs originate from shops where they are harmless.
Some HCoVs are also known to be intermediate sub-host viruses.
Animal host recognition has a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals may also provide important insights into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about seven HCoVs, with their history of discovery and their main sources of zoning and cross-transmission focus.
Importantly, we compared different HCoV viruses with viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this section.
In addition, the effects of viral evolution on successful host requirements and disease severity have also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of covalently attached, positively-sensing, single-pass RNA viruses.
These viruses, which have the largest genome at 26 to 32 kilobases in the group of RNA viruses and are called "CoVs" because of their crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unsequential genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large broad-spectrum open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab transcript polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1~16
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
One-chain-linked access proteins are encoded by different numbers of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta CoV), in which the beta CoV genus contains multiple HCoVs and is divided into four strands (A, B, C and D).
Polygenetic evidence has shown that shrews and mice serve as the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main depository of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously overcome a variety of barriers and some have emerged as major human diseases.
To date, seven human HCoVs have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha CoVs.
The other five beta CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as the common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively high number of patients with a high chance of developing upper respiratory tract disease.
The first patient of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the gross discharge of the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more data has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless until SARS emerged.
The SARS epidemic that developed in 2003 is the most devastating event in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a case fatality rate of nearly 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic caused a sustained infection in the Arabian Peninsula and would spread to the rest of the world.
The novel 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2), is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from shoparks, mice or domestic animals.
The line of evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from shopercans, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but present with high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented major medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the origins of the HCoVs in the zones provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and limiting factors of species encoding.
This may facilitate the guidance or search for the reservoir, intermediate and extended animal host (s) of SARS-CoV-2, which have important indications in preventing future outbreaks.
In this review we present the zoonotic origin, cross-transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we address and discuss the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are specifically nonpathogenic at their natural reserve host but become pathogenic after crossing over to a new host.
We also look at the evolutionary status of HCoVs in which increased transmissibility often comes with decreased disease.
Ongoing results of SARS-CoV-2 in this area have also been discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.
Before the first isolate of HCoV-229E B814 was inhaled from the pus of patients who had normal human disease, various CoVs were isolated in a variety of diseased animals, including elephant chickens, mice, cows, chickens, cats and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and guiding.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory disease during 1966, and was later adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have symptoms of the common cold, including headache, burning, neck pain, fever and cough observed in 10 ~ 20 percent of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial crossing in the brains of lung mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which is not isolated from microbes with other respiratory triangles such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and they are transmitted during the winter season in tropical climates.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, and the incubation period is approximately 2 weeks.
According to a human voluntary study, healthy individuals who were infected with HCoV-229E developed the common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe low-grade respiratory influenza.
SARS, also known as "apical pneumonia", was the first known epidemic caused by HCoV in human history and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was detected in China's Guangdong province in late 2002.
A total of 8,096 cases have been reported as a result of the SARS outbreak, with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to high prevalence, it was estimated that each case developed approximately 4 secondary cases, with a duration of remission of 4 to 7 days and viral weight gain manifested on the tenth day of infection.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV are first diagnosed with myalgia, headache, fever, aches and pains, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as delayed onset symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver/blood function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common SARS laboratory abnormalities.
Reduced alveolar damage, increased epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation afterwards.
In addition to respiratory tract infection, a number of organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver/blood and kidney can also become infected in these severe events, usually with cytokine storm, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of relatives of an IBS patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, extensive efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially identified in adolescents, adults and patients with dementia with respiratory diseases.
Choriasis, conjunctivitis, fever, and the presence of a pulmonary germ are common in disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described an isolated example of the basal virus in an 8-month-old boy with a chest infection in the Netherlands.
Although it is recognized in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed internationally.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, with its highest incidence occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and pneumonia.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma.
HCoV-NL63, similar to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found globally, causing minor respiratory illness.
All four community-acquired HCoVs are well-normalized in humans and are generally unlikely to cause more severe disease, while the cases are of unknown cause as the most viral subtypes of HCoV-NL63 are reported to be causing short-term respiratory illness in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs acquire the capabilities to transmit efficiently and persist in humans, they also become less dangerous or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases have occasionally been reported in close secondary contacts in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary disease was developed in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed severe renal failure, which is very specific for Mers in HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and inflammation.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high case rate of 34.4%, making Mers-CoV the deadliest virus known to humans.
From mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases identified as being related to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared an ongoing case of respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of global concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4 percent of cases still/unconfirmed.
Notably, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness similar to CoV and MERS-CoV, presenting as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are clustered in different branches of the phyllagic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently a less cancerous disease but is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal several useful differences.
First, the incubation period and the infection period of HCoVs are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four socially acquired HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit the forms most commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including presenting with non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting ways that both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs exhibit characteristics.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than that of HCoVs, at least in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans as seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 must be detected in fecal samples.
However, ovarian-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some cases, as will be clarified by future studies.
It is particularly of great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonal as is the case with community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 variant will be influential for the eventual fate of ongoing COVID-19 after its transmission, disease and subsequent spread to humans.
Four community-acquired HCoVs that produce mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have shown good adaptation to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived an earlier HCoV outbreak.
HCoVs that cause severe illness in humans. and humans that have caused severe HCoV illness have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate sufficiently in humans to allow adaptable mutations that combat host-constraining factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people infected, the greater the chance that it will be transmitted to humans entirely.
If it is well known, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have circulated in the human population, becoming common colds in immunized subjects.
These viruses do not require animal stockpiles.
In contrast, the highly carcinogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well tolerated in humans and cannot be transmitted to humans.
They need to conserve and propagate in their zoological reserves and seek opportunities to develop for questionable human purposes.
SARS-CoV-2 has a morphology that is similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is much less pathogenic/infectious than community-acquired HCoVs and is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would serve us well to discuss the evolution, natural deposition, intermediate and propagating host definitions and characteristics of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it is related to an immediate ancestor that shares a higher homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The older virus is often well-known and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the host HCoV retains deposits continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the host has a natural disease and is the natural host of the HCoV or is the parent of the virus.
In contrast, if HCoVs are introduced to humans before or around their introduction to a new intermediate host, they do not adapt well to the new host and are often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play a transitional role by transmitting the virus through and then transmitting it to humans by expanding the human infection rate.
HCoVs can carry out lethal infections if they cannot protect their transmission to an intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can co-exist with intermediate hosts and even generate long-term beneficial effects.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the host of the natural reserve.
Looking at epidemiological data it has been shown that the SARS index case has a history of contact with animals.
Subsequent superprovocation studies showed that pet traders had higher levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibodies than the general population.
Masked squirrels (Pygoma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were first known to transmit SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that there were no more SARS reports after all the blockades on the market had been killed.
However, it was reported that masked carnivores from the wild or farms without access to pet markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked carnivores may only be moderate hosts but not natural reservoirs of CoV-SARS.
Significantly, since 80% of the different animals in markets in Guangzhou have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that small vector species may also serve as hosts for moderate increases in SARS-CoV is high.
All of these appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV mortality.
A closely related CoV evening spider in search of a natural host for SARS-CoV has emerged, referred to as SARS-related renulophus CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese horseshoe shops.
These spores are positive for SARSR-RH-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence and SARS-CoV antibodies.
These and other CoVs share a 92%-88% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new idea that the caterpillar hosts the human embryonic human cortex.
Several SARS-CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in the evening primates, but none can be isolated as a live virus except for one virus identified as WIV1.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor or acceptor of SARS-CoV.
Unabsorbed fecal samples of vesicles were sequenced in WIV1, which uses the vesicle, spider and human ACE2 receptor to enter the cell.
It is noteworthy that the serum or serum of SARS-convalescent patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in the evening primates, with 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Although there are many similarities between these two viruses, the general belief is that WIV1 is not the nearest parent virus of SARS-CoV and that the evening primrose is not the nearest protective host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis and analysis classify MERS-CoV into the same group as evening primate CoV-HKU4 and evening primate CoV-HKU5.
Both evening primate CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
RNAThe MERS-CoV-related RNA polymer series is phylogenetically close to the late-stage beta-CoVs known in Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild evening primates.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity to evening primate CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, evening primates are probably not the closest protective host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that Arabian camels have shown positive results for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to Arabian Middle Eastern camels in many African countries.
Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal fluids of Arabian camels, suggesting that camels are the main protective hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that the experimentally tested MERS-CoV-infected camels generally showed mild symptoms but had a more widespread transmission of the virus.
It is worth noting that infected camels not only transmit the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the feces  mouth, which is also the main route of transmission of the virus in evening primates.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of any contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, apparently not human-to-human transmission or attributed to unknown transmission routes involving unidentified animals that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleotide similarity to the RaTG13 of the Rhinolysis affinis evening primates.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the range of variation or remoteness between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine a paternal relationship.
This means that the evening primates are not likely to be the host of SARS-CoV-2 unless a nearby cuttlefish is also found to have evening primate coronavirus in the future.
Most likely, the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host animals must have been between wild animals bought and killed at the Henan seafood wholesale market, where most early cases of COVID-19 were confined, indicating a possible case of animal-to-human transmission.
A number of recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that the endangered small animals known as the honey bee (Manis yavannica) may also carry inherited beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of the novel pangolin CoV share a common nucleotide sequence of 85-92% of homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also more closely related to RaTG13 with approximately 90% similarity in the nucleotide sequence.
Viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree are grouped into two subfamilies, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RBD) most similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
Most notably, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, RBD are very different, although with a genome-wide homology sequence size.
An earlier study of infected beekeepers also reported the detection of viral infection from samples from the lungs, similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different combinatorial methods and manual fabrication to produce a three-level genome sequence with a composition of approximately 86.3% full-length of the viral genome.
We cannot also rule out the possibility that bees are one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently, due to the different sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the bee-related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs, there is no evidence directly supporting an origin between bee-borne and SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the bee-related SARS-CoV-2 that is associated with beta-CoVs.
The growth pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in mammals, bees and other animals has not yet been identified.
While a high range of homology has been found in RBD genes between SARS-CoV-2 and the bee, SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs share a high level of genome-wide sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to the increased association of the preference mediator.
Another proposal then advocates a re-production between the SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV of the bee and RaTG13 in third wild animal species.
As a growth force driver, regeneration is more widespread among beta-CoVs.
Judgments about the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still far from being made.
In addition, the animal origin of the highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from spore CoVs, while the inherited viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 originated in the mouse family.
A tick CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in the North American Three-ringed tick has been reported to show close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another strain of CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, found in Ghana, while there is also suspicion of an intermediate host in the camel family.
For clarity, a summary of the current available information on the origin of HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Historically, paleogenetic analyses have provided evidence for evidence of animal-to-animal transmission of HCoVs.
When HCoV-OC43 came from domestic animals to humans in about 1890, respiratory infections were recorded.
The history of animal-to-animal transmission of HCoV-229E is poorly understood.
Cucumber alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among these is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
A number of different lines of evidence support evidence of transmission of viruses between rodents and humans.
First, humans may have had contact with alpacas in the ecological realm.
However, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, alpaca-related alpha-CoVs are variants of HCoV-229E and do not cause illness in alpacas, whereas alpaca-related alpha-CoVs have caused respiratory illness in infected animals.
As a result, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas may acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, diarrhoea is a direct source of human pathogens including rabies, Ebola, Nephritis and Hendrix.
It is therefore not surprising that mosquitoes may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while the alpha-CoVs of the mosquito act as the source of the inheritance of HCoV-229E, alpacas and a buck's camel may be intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as demonstrated by the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of animal-to-animal transmission from a buck camel and a buck camel to humans.
The origin of MERS-CoV growth from mosquitoes was identified early and supported by recent findings.
It is clear that the genetic code and the means of transmission between animals is a rich source of viruses among animals.
Longevity, high population density, close social connections and strong flight capability are all supportive conditions that make cockroaches suitable carriers of the virus.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been transmitted to a buck camel for decades.
It has become well-adapted to these animals that have evolved from an intermediate host to a stable and natural resource.
MERS-CoV causes a very low rate of morbidity and largely maintains a low rate of mutation in these animals.
It is an isolated case of uncontrolled transmission to humans and humans are the end hosts of MERS-CoV as transmission cannot continue.
Unlike camel eggs in MERS-CoV transmission, the contribution of honeybees, if any, to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-CoVs of the bee are highly pathogenic in the bees.
In the case of SARS-CoVs transmitted to cats, they may be a host of endemic SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Various animal-to-human transmission possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 should be accepted or not accepted in future studies.
First, it is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 related virus may be the source of a similar host to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an environmental area similar to that of the butcher or sugarcane fields.
Second, it is possible that the beekeepers are a proliferating intermediate host to which SARS-CoV-2-related viruses have recently been transmitted.
Humans are infected by the virus through butcher and hunter-gatherer routes.
Many animals, including domestic animals, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals is required for antibodies.
Third, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in recombinant and habituated third animals that have been in contact with both ruminants and ruminants.
The search for an animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is also ongoing.
In addition to the different species of host animals, three virologically important factors are also important for the ease of transmission of CoVs to animals.
First, their high mutation rate is highly significant in RNA re-production.
Compared to other single strand RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs may be from a "medium" to a "high" level, with a median mutation rate of ~10-4 per year in every 2 regions, and this depends on the stage of the new host CoV.
CoVs have exoribonuclease correction, which results in high mutation rates and reduced or no persistence of removal.
Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, is known to inhibit the replication of CoVs by exoribonucleases and RNA-binding RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is highly anti-stimulating to SARS-CoV-2 agents to be clinically tested.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is almost one million times higher than their host.
In addition, the mutation rate is higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
With a higher mutation rate than SARS-CoV, it is observed that SARS-CoV-2 has a lower mutation rate, which implies a higher degree of adaptation to humans.
It may have become accustomed to a host similar to that of modern humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also relevant for MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a buck's camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic mutation will render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective anytime soon.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs uses greater flexibility in genome editing and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of cross-species co-growth, which is useful for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
It supports 3′-encoded open reading frames at the end of the genome and more specific function of proteins.
Third, CoVs alter irregular and repeating patterns during RNA regrowth through a specific" copy-alternative" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a common ancestor, a string shift occurs frequently during the RNA transcription of the CoV.
High-level full-length and subgenomic RNA genes can be recombined to produce new CoVs.
Paleogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as the S.L.CoV and S.H.C.V.HKU9.
Transmission-related virus-host relationships
In addition to the three viral agents mentioned above, animal-to-animal transmission is another important factor.
Therefore, SARS-CoV recombination has been taken as a common example, which has also shown evidence of positive alternatives during animal-to-animal transmission events.
Based on comparative analyses between human and cat SARS-CoVs and SARS-CoVs, it is thought that in different hosts, specifically the S protein, RBD mutations undergo rapid adaptation.
Typically, the S protein RBD of a CoV binds to the cytoplasmic receptor and is strongly picked up by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD in the S1 fragment is on the 318th to 510th amino acids that bind to human ACE2 and to the companion receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV, RBD can identify ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including cats, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing the virus to spread between animals.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues in RBD differed from humans and feral cats and 4 were located in the receptor-binding pattern for binding to the ACE2 receptor.
Cat SARS-CoV has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein for binding to the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, mutations of these two amino acids may be important for the virus' adaptation to humans.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 shares a common cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit suggests that the human tendency for S protein to bind to ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a cryo-EM study showed a 10 to 20 percent higher affinity for binding, as long as it is between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any of the companion receptors may be necessary for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a single S-terminus.
There are several HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylsalicylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
After spreading from their animal host to animals, they may also be considered for successful adaptation of these CoVs.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of animal-to-animal transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host need and restriction factors.
The differences in these host proteins between human and natural resource hosts of HCoVs such as bats, a duck camel, and mice may be a barrier to inter-animal transmission.
For HCoVs to spread successfully between animals, they must overcome host-requirement factors and eliminate host-restriction factors.
Therefore, molecular agents in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and described.
Using advanced CRISPR technology may be useful for genome-wide uninterrupted screening for host-required and barrier factors of SARS-CoV-2.
Emergence of new HCoVs: Back to the source
The high strain of coccal CoVs provides more opportunities for new HCoVs to emerge.
Therefore, the HCoVs of the plague are the source of the HCoVs gene pool.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also contribute to the growth of HCoVs and serve as two key steps in that sequence.
For example, the acquisition or deletion of new protein-coding genes is capable of drastically altering the viral phenotype.
Among SARS-CoV-associated proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-associated spike viruses have been isolated but found to encode different ORF8 proteins.
The presence of a 29-nucleotide that is characteristic of SARS-CoVs is found in viruses that have been identified as early human infectious diseases.
This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a habit change in inducing host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with family members of alpha and gamma-CoVs, where regions of RNA that require RNA polymers have been found to recombine.
Back-synthesis sites are also known in nsp9, many nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that MERS-CoV infection has experienced back-synthesis between different families, originating in the wake of a Saudi Arabian bubonic plague.
In addition, cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV recombination have been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-natural genetic makeup.
It should also be noted that artificial fertilization may involve unintentional alteration of viral genomes, largely as a result of selective induced stresses, such as the release of viruses by the host immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in HCoV-229E, due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While full ORF4 can be observed in the HCoV-229E-related rat and camel viruses, the alpaca alpha-CoV insertion shows a single nucleotide, resulting in mutations.
Consequently, the growth of new HCoVs is also driven by alternative stresses in their host deposits.
Asymptomatic disease or only mild disease has been found when rats are infected with CoVs, suggesting a shared habit between CoVs and rats.
It appears that the monkeys have become well-adapted to CoVs automatically and physiologically.
For example, disturbances in the activity of the leafy response in mosquitoes actively reduce the pathogenic activation by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in mice is inhibited by the inhibitory activity of natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low-level original equivalence I-terminal molecules.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the highly metabolic activity of the virus may prevent both CoV re-production and corrective effects by exoribonucleases, as they provide a catalytic stress for production when the highly pathogenic virus is transferred to a new host.
The most pathogenic CoV viruses may mutate by recombination, and acquire new proteins or protein forms to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause low disease in their host hosts such as rats and camels.
They reproduce rapidly without a strong host immune response.
So there is a mystery as to why asymptomatic patients are seen and what causes severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are primarily due to the high activity of the immune response and cytokine surges, i.e. the stronger the immune response, the greater the lung damage.
In other words, the immune response in asymptomatic patients is isolated from the reproduction of CoV.
Similar strategies of immune response isolation may have beneficial effects in antiretroviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response in rats is particularly strong.
Therefore, giving type I interferon in the early stages of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be beneficial.
In addition, there are NLRP3 inflammasome activation disorders in mice.
With this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it has been found that a single-celled beta-CoV shares 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is also a single-celled bat-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide structure with SARS-CoV-2.
While cats and other animals in markets have been found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV, no nearby intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Bees-eating beta-CoVs were found to be more similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bees could be intermediate hosts or that bees-eating beta-CoVs could be involved with gene fragments in the resulting SARS-CoV-2 sample.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally engineered by humans.
CoVs have once again become common due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of CoVs in monkeys and other animals have greatly changed our understanding of the transmission of HCoVs to humans and the importance of deposition and animal origin in animals.
Overall evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are mainly parasitic and transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that the SARS-CoV virus originated from human-cat contact in markets, closing flea markets and killing cats could have effectively eradicated the SARS epidemic.
Based on the same argument, beekeepers should be kept away from wet markets to prevent animal transmission, as beekeeper beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and a number of associations have been found.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans from bee-eaters or other animals remains to be clarified in future studies.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has long been present in the lungs of a buck.
These camels serve as an important source of transportation as well as a central source of meat, milk, leather and small products for the local people.
They are widely available in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as was done in Chinese wet markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the re-spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach must be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV in camels, among other outbreak control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate the virus, new genotypes can emerge and cause spread.
There are many variants of CoVs in the wild.
Especially the spotted CoVs have a higher variation with animal potential.
There are many opportunities for these animal CoVs to mutate and recombine, resulting in new CoVs that are more likely to spread in the future and/or are lethal in humans.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be avoided to reduce the need for interaction between humans and animals.
A preparedness and response plan for the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 pandemic should be developed.
In fact, there have been many viruses in the world for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although mosquitoes have many features that contribute to the spread of viruses, the chances of human contact with mosquitoes and other wildlife can be reduced if people are educated to stay away from them.
Ongoing monitoring from animals is necessary to gain an understanding of the environment of CoVs and the natural environment of the host, which will prove useful in preventing future animal-to-human outbreaks.
Consequently, the most effective way for humans to prevent animal viruses is to stay away from the environmental area of natural reserves of animal viruses.
A number of pieces of the mystery of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bees transmit hereditary SARS-CoV-2 to honeybees, it would be interesting to see under what conditions bees and honeybees might share the same environmental domain.
Second, if the bacteria are directly responsible for human transmission, it is necessary to know how humans interact with the bacteria.
Third, if a third animal acts as the primary intermediate host, how it interacts with a variety of animals including humans, bees and beetles, must be clarified.
Consequently, since many animals including domestic animals may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental transmission should be performed.
Whether it is a mammal, a bee-eater or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or closely related hereditary viruses will be identified in their natural habitat in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will shed light on the pathways of SARS-CoV-2 growth in animals, which will be important in the prevention and control outcomes of COVID-19 in humans.
Data on the diagnostic criteria of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be updated.
On 6 February 2020, we published a rapid advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, which provides our experience and better information for combating this common infection worldwide.
However, as 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus is a novel disease, our understanding and knowledge are constantly increasing based on the experience of ongoing research findings and clinical work; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we provide a commentary on our guidance and propose new diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", based on the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (eighth edition), published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, currently officially named Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus name was changed to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease, our team developed a quick advice guide and on 06 February 2020 it was published online in Military Medical Research.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its release.
But keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge are constantly increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), as of 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions, some of which have been substantially modified.
Now our advice has gained an opinion by Zhou et al, who suggested a score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to guide us and is valuable information for this pandemic.
We acknowledge their hard work and express our gratitude.
However, information about their work should also be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines and studies for COVID-19 (Testing Seventh Edition).
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm a suspected case, the epidemiological history must be combined with two items of clinical evidence to form a comprehensive analysis, or must satisfy three items of clinical evidence if no apparent epidemiological history exists.
Infectious disease identification history: (1) travel or residence history to Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the previous 14 days prior to the outbreak; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 outbreak cases (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) contact history with patients from Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the previous 14 days prior to the outbreak, including contact history with three new cases of fever or respiratory illness; (4) contact history with a confirmed number of cases from the previous 14 days, including a history of ≥ 2 cases and a total of 2 cases of TB/CFS in a school, office, home, and other settings, such as a school, in a week.
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) infection with COVID-19 with imaging features; (3) normal, decreased, or decreased white blood cell counts at the early onset.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case based on one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence materials: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high similarity to the novel coronavirus; (3) a positive serum test for a specific IgM antibody and a positive serum test for a specific IgM antibody of SARS-CoV-2; or SARS-CoV-2 has a positive test for a specific IgM antibody from negative to positive, or the material ≥4 increases in the recovery phase to what is in the severe phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
Pathogenic identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added in the eighth edition.
These changes are based on the continued work of researchers to investigate high levels of nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, and blood samples including those taken from the respiratory tract, which added the availability of differentiated samples, and supported the delivery of uniquely positive results on the validated criterion.
In addition, there is additional evidence that we should treat patients with normal and asymptomatic symptoms with caution.
Therefore, the map data of Zhou et al. should be updated, as those without clinical symptoms are classified as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be validated in other clinical work and studies.
As a result, we hope to see more solid evidence and invite readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that countries follow and comply with the new guidelines.
Our team has updated its guidance in time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five more Covid-19 deaths, the highest number of deaths per day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed the death of five more people due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day there.

On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian retail chain Wolverines and Coles relaxed restrictions on the sale of toilet paper, which is two or one pack at a time nationally in all stores.
ALDI also introduced a cap on packaging on Monday.
The restrictions were posted in the form of alert messages on the exit points and on the chain's Facebook page.
The buyers were reportedly hiding from being quarantined due to COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Wolverhus also lowered the purchase limit for toilet paper for the home to one pack.
These changes followed the four-package delivery of the old one introduced by Woolworth and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in a March 8 media report that the four bars were subject to a restriction, "most stores sell out within an hour of arrival" and called the demand "unprecedented", while Aldi called the Facebook post on Tuesday "surprising".
A Wolverhus spokesperson said sales had "increased significantly" last week.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the permitted quantity limit to two last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles asked suppliers for larger packages and an increase in supplies, Wolverhus ordered extra stock, and Aldi prepared stock for a planned special Wednesday.
Australian Retail Association chief executive Russell Zimmerman said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but this was hampered by a ban on trucks being timed by local councils.
He expects production costs to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand and what is specific.
On Tuesday, Alde announced that after the stock runs out, some stores will not be able to operate on Wednesdays.
Dr Gary Mortimer, of Queensland University of Technology, told News.com.au that stores are filling up every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a big product, and small quantities are scarce, and when sold out, spaces in large shelves become empty, causing a feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Clouse and Wolverhus had an idea that if there were more items in the closet, and if there were more items like toilets and sanitizers, there might be less risk.
The recycled toilet paper vendor said on Wednesday that it was running out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Clinix toilet tissue and Solaris paper sorbent, was quoted by News.com as saying they worked 24/7 to restore supplies.
Real estate site Domain.com reported that employees at Melbourne K Property have given away toilet paper from the auctioneers at the K-O-L auction, a series of auctions held due to the time constraints of the Labour de Bundy.
The eighth issue of Darwin's newspaper NT News Thursday was used as toilet paper.
According to the Australian BC March 3 report, store owners were not in favor of the restrictions, and have no plans to impose a ban on buying items.
Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other items is also high, including masks, sanitizers, dry cleaning products, handwash and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday, the British online supermarket Andries Toilet Paper observed 12 rolls of Pex being bought.
The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
If the word outbreak refers to a high level of disease, not a high level of risk, the World Health Organization has ordered governments to take action.
All countries can still reverse the pandemic.
WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that if countries responded by detecting, testing, treating, and empowering their people, they would be better off.
We are all more concerned about the dangerous spread and severity of the disease in many homes than about the lack of action.
Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the outbreak was "unprecedented".
He said in an analysis published on CNN in February that other viruses besides influenza were spreading globally.
Gibrisus also expressed his analysis, saying that Mong had never faced an outbreak like the coronavirus outbreak before.
He said, "Mong has never seen an outbreak that could be contained at any time".
The World Health Organization decided in January that the outbreak would be declared a global public health emergency with the new outbreak situation.
The head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the outbreak will worsen further down the line.
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that 4,600 people died out of the 1,260,000 people infected with the coronavirus.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is a continuation of the coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and a national health emergency was declared on December 13 due to international concerns, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.60 million cases of coronavirus have been reported in 210 countries, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
More than 364,000 people have recovered from the disease.
The mortality rate was recorded at 4% in China, and 13.04% worldwide, 0.08% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, dry cough, and fatigue.
The severe and complex symptoms of the disease include chest pain, respiratory blockage, and loss of function in many organs, resulting in weakness or death.
Symptoms usually appear within five days of the onset of the disorder, but in some cases it takes two to 14 days.
There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the novel coronavirus.
First-line treatment is helpful in relieving symptoms and helping the patient.Recommended precautions are important, such as hand washing, coughing, keeping distance, and isolating suspected persons.
Authorities around the world are enforcing laws such as travel bans, quarantines, tourism bans, workplace risk control.
The pandemic has caused severe economic and social disruption worldwide, with the cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events and the transmission of fear buying declining significantly.
Universities and schools have been closed on a national or local basis in all 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
Online references to the virus were shared as misinformation, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, including people of East and Southeast Asian descent, and areas affected by the virus.
The decline in transportation and the closure of major factories have led to a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, a case of cyniumonia of unknown etology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Most cases are linked to Huan'an seafood and the virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
The pandemic virus, known as SARS-CoV, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the yellow fever coronavirus, the pandemic coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.The first person infected on 1 December 2019 was not in contact with the wheat clover market.
Two-thirds of the cases first reported in December 2019 were found to be linked to the market.
In China, an unconfirmed report in the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 said that 55 cases had been detected in Hubei Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, the WHO and China reported a decrease in cases but an increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
Cases may be underreported, especially in cases with mild symptoms.
Few cases were reported in young people on 26 February, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of the world's cases, with UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Valance estimating that 60% of the UK population should have pre-pandemic immunity.
The number of cases refers to people who have been tested for COVID-19.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, with most countries having a policy of not testing low-symptom laboratories, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March stated that as of 23 January, approximately 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected and that non-infectious infection was the source of 79% of cases.
According to a statistical analysis published on 30 March, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Italy is much higher than previously reported.
The baseline production number before the COVID-19 first dose is RO (1.40) to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests it may be 5.7.
More people are crying out for COVID-19.
The incubation period for death is 6 to 41 days, and for most people it is 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97.000 billion deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, 80% of deaths as of 5 February were among people over 60, and 75% had pre-existing heart disease and diabetes, generally a protocol for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 before the official outbreak.
It is possible that the actual death toll from COVID-19 is higher, as this will not include deaths that occurred without testing, for example in homes or nursing homes and other settings.
Preliminary data from Italy show that the death toll from COVID-19 is 5x-4 higher than the official death toll.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that the (death toll) was low, the Anicdotal report said, with previously under-confirmed cases in the U.S. such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first deaths outside mainland China were reported in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first deaths outside Asia were reported in France on 14 February.
28 February Outside mainland China, dozens of deaths were reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories and every continent except Antarctica have reported deaths, with more general measures in place to measure deaths.
These numbers vary with region and time, and are influenced by the volume of trials, quality of health care, treatment options, time after the first outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health, with the death-to-incidence ratio reflecting the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University figures, the global mortality rate is 6.0% as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies by region.
The mortality rate in China has decreased from 17.3% (in cases with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in cases with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who have died from the disease, and case fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of sick (diagnosed and undiagnosed) people who have died from the disease.
The syndrome has no time limit and specific populations follow from infection to resolution.
Some academic institutions have attempted to apply these figures to specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Medicine has put the evidence-based measure at a morbidity rate of between 0.1% and 0.39 for the outbreak.
The highest extent of this range in Germany is the incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses, and a statistical study measures the impact of diagnoses on the CFR.
The World Health Organization has stated that the epidemic is under control.
The incidence and timing of disease is uncertain and varies from place to place.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University says that uncontrolled infectious disease generally fades and then begins to decline when the disease spreads from an existing host.
But it is impossible to predict exactly when this will happen.
Zhong Nashan, the top medical adviser to the Chinese government, argues that it will end by June if all countries follow the WHO recommendations to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Typical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be contagious for one or two years.
Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, said that social distancing and other precautions would be needed "until a vaccine is available (in the next 18 months or so)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that the coronavirus - because it is so contagious - will disappear completely and it is possible" to turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year.
The return of the virus will depend on the extent of immunity and mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively undetectable and patients may be symptom-free.
Two common symptoms are 88% fever and 68% dehydration.
A few common symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, back pain, headache, cancer, convulsions, haemorrhoids, patches or dizziness. The World Health Organization says that one in six people become ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a list of emergency symptoms that include respiratory problems, chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty in breathing, and swelling in the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is recommended for those with these symptoms.
These patients will not have any symptoms or medical symptoms, but the diagnosis will reveal the disease, the researcher advised, and those who had close contact with the infected should be monitored and investigated to rule out infection.
China has a 44 percent asymptomatic rate.
The time between symptoms and contamination is 14 days, with a maximum of 5 days, in which the uncertainty is that the sensitivity of COVID-19 patients will be 30 percent and then 15 percent.
Some explanations for how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is first transmitted through close contact with humans, usually through airborne droplets, exposure to air, or contact with close people 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The findings suggest that the virus can be transmitted from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 (27) feet by coughing in the open air.
Some people suggest that the virus can also be transmitted in the form of small droplets in the air because it remains in the air for many hours, which does not leave during speech, and respiratory droplets that are produced during breathing but are not naturally produced during speech.
These droplets may be injected into the mouth or nose of nearby people or may travel to the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) also involve aerosolized and airborne respiratory fluids.
The virus can also be spread by touching the eyes, nose and mouth in case of contact with contaminated surfaces, including skin.
There is also concern that the disease may also be spread through waste materials but this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 was contaminated.The virus is more likely to spread within three days of onset of symptoms than before the onset of symptoms and the final stages of the disease.
People who tested positive for the disease three days before the onset of the outbreak have the potential to transmit before significant symptoms develop.
There are only laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic case reports, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others.The virus lives on for hours to several days.
In particular, the virus was found to be detected on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on board cardboard for one day, and on copper for up to four hours.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, such as other surfaces that may have been in contact with the disease.
Severe and delicate respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that was first isolated from three patients in Wuhan with severe respiratory disease-associated chest pain.
All of the components of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature in the corresponding coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by family soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS.
The virus is thought to have originated in animals.
Genetic analysis indicates that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the beta coronavirus genus in the subgenus Sarbacvirus (Class B) with two antibodies.
It is 96% identical at the total genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between penguins and viruses from humans in some parts of the genome sequences.
A comparison of the full genome to date found a relatively high 92% of genetic material shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove a pangolin to be an intermediate host.
Viral-borne infection can be diagnosed briefly based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately compensated by polymerase chain reaction of infected products or CT images.
A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its reactions overlapping with other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a first-line test or screening tool for COVID-19 diagnosis".
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on breath or blood samples.
Results are typically available within a few hours to days.
Typically this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal swab while a spinal swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies run serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
The serological test developed by Silix in the United States is approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Imaging features in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) that are symptomatic include abnormal peripheral grade apoptosis and absent optimistic factor
The Italian Association of Radiologists compiles a global online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to the prevalence of other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by PCR has limited specificity in detecting COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT results of the stent to PCR and showed that although the reaction is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its value as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Strong neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect viral responses with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, preventing the removal of hands from the hands, nose and mouth, and coughing or sneezing and throwing tissue directly into a waste container.
People who may already have the infection are recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been proposed to prevent transmission.Many governments restricted or advised all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a stage of spread over large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some community members do not know where and how they have been infected. Health care providers are looking out for those who may use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact stabilization is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have been raised with governments using location data from mobile phones for this purpose, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on such surveillance in a statement.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or recommended for voluntary use, and as of April 20, 2020, expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to connect users to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are spread about how to prevent infection. For example, cleaning the nose and mouth with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although several organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when hands are visibly wet; before eating; and after bathing, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks down its protective bubble.
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The World Health Organization advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
Faces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (expose stainless steel faces to a disinfectant for at least one minute) including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solvents such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that any office or other location with a suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus should be disinfected of all rooms, restrooms, common meeting areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, typewriters, remote controls and ATMs that the patient is using.
Health organizations recommend that people cough or sneeze by covering their mouth and nose with a cloth or a cloth and then immediately handling the cloth.
Surgical anesthesia may be recommended for individuals who are infected with the virus, but anesthesia may reduce the swelling of their airways and their ability to travel when coughing, sneezing or speaking.
The World Health Organization recommends when and how to use masks.
According to University of Leeds virologist Stephen Graven, wearing a mask can reduce people's exposure to their faces, but not washing their hands properly is the most common cause of the condition.Masks may also be recommended for people who care for and care for sick people.
The WHO advises wearing masks to people at high risk, such as those who care for people with COVID-19 and who also acknowledge that wearing masks will not prevent them from touching their face.
Many countries have begun encouraging people to wear masks in public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends non-woven facial masks.China has advised that healthy individuals in particular wear non-woven medical masks and then when they are close to other people (at 1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended surgical verrucas if travelling on public transport or staying in crowded areas.
Thai health authorities encourage the public to make a face mask at home and wash it daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a ban on going out is in place if you are not wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam urged everyone to wear face coverings when leaving the country to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government made it mandatory for everyone to enter the grocery store, so face coverings were required.
Israel has mandated that all residents wear face coverings in public.
Taiwan, which has been making ten million buses a day since mid-March, imposed buses on passengers on Hurghada and inter-city buses on April 1.
Panama has assumed that it will make use of face masks when going out and has advised those who cannot afford masks to make their own at home.
Facial masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves the use of physical distancing to control the spread of disease by reducing the distance between people.
Measures include self-isolation, restrictions on travel and closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, exhibitions and markets.
Individuals should practice self-isolation by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding public gatherings, not mixing in greetings and social distancing.
Many governments mandate or advise social distancing in areas that have not been affected by the disease.
The US government and health organizations have immediately reduced the number of cases from 250 to 50 (if there is no COVID-19 outbreak in the area) and then to 10.
On March 22, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people, with older adults and those undergoing treatment for conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a weakened immune system at increased risk of severe illness, as the CDC advised to stay home more in the event of an outbreak.In March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began replacing the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", with the intention of reducing physical contact with the affected person, regardless of whether they were in a sanctioned or distanced situation.
The term "social distancing" has been implicitly used to refer to people being kept in social isolation, rather than encouraging others to interact with each other in a manner that some authorities have also recommended for sexual health during the pandemic.
The specific recommendations are to have sex with someone you live with, who is free of the virus and has no symptoms.
Special home isolation is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who are suspected to have the disease.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidance for appropriate special quarantine.More governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine in the affected area.
Tougher self-quarantine guidelines have been adopted in high-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with a person who is not infected with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the virus is prevalent are also advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from that date.
Elimination or prevention and reduction in the level of spread are included in the policy of epidemic control.
Virus containment is performed in the early stages of an outbreak to diagnose and isolate people infected with the virus, and also to determine the extent of disease control and vaccine-related components to prevent infection of other people.
When disease cannot be contained, efforts are made to reduce the disease: measures are taken to reduce the rate of transmission and limit the effects of the disease on society and the health system.
It is also possible to combine both disease containment and mitigation.
Elimination requires more drastic measures to reduce the epidemic to a baseline multiplication rate of less than 1.One aspect of epidemic management is to try to reduce the spread of an epidemic by reducing the spread of the epidemic, which is called the spread of the epidemic.
This lowers the risk level to health services that have been depleted and provides additional time for other treatment services and vaccine development.
Medical measures that can control the spread of the virus are individual protective measures such as: hand washing, wearing a mask, and self-quarantine; and social measures that include social distancing such as: closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; community acceptance of and participation in these measures; and sanitary measures such as cleaning surfaces.When the severity of the virus outbreak became apparent, China implemented all the strictest measures to limit the spread of the virus, including complete city quarantine and strict travel restrictions.
Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has asked all its citizens to quarantine and issued severe travel warnings for those infected.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those involved who quarantined themselves and fined those who did not quarantine.
Taiwan has increased production of masks and penalized medical supplies.The UK-US parallel shows that there are significant challenges in mitigating the virus (reducing the level of transmission without stopping it) and eradicating the virus (preventing the spread of the epidemic).
A virus mitigation policy may reduce healthcare demand by two thirds and deaths by half, but it could still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and healthcare services being lost.
Elimination of the virus may be optimal but should continue as long as the virus is present in the population (and if a vaccine is developed before then, this phase should continue for as long as possible), but if measures are stopped, it will soon bring the virus back.
Long-term restrictions to eradicate the virus cause social and economic losses.
There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking antipyretic medication, drinking fluids, and resting may help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the use of synthetic oxygen, serum, and respiratory system strength are necessary for the patient's health.
Steroid use can worsen the outcome.
Many compounds that were used for other viral diseases have also been investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has said that some "customary and family therapies" can provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has described increasing capacity and healthcare measures for people with COVID-19.
ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Hospitals, Primary Health Care in Europe have issued guidance on the delivery of equipment at different levels, including a focus on COVID-19 diagnostics in laboratories.
Many theories are also possible (called zero disease).
The first positive case of the coronavirus was reported in Obi, Wuhan, China on 1 December 2019.
In Hubei, cases of coronavirus have been steadily increasing in a month.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale shell market, which also sells live animals, and there is a theory that the virus originated in animals, in other words, the virus is of zoonotic origin, emerged on 26 December due to an unidentified cluster of pneumonia and was notified to the WHO.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to the SARS coronavirus outbreak.
The eight doctors, including Lee Wen Liang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors and disrespecting other fan leaders.
The Wuhan Municipal Hospital Commission issued a public warning to residents and on December 31 it issued a warning to the World Health Organization.
An unidentified case of pneumonia in Wuhan in January was reported to health authorities for thorough investigation, with the number of cases, in the early part of the outbreak, doubling every seven to seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, including the Chinese New Year migration transportation hub of Wuhan and the vice-local hub of the Great Train Exchange.
On 20 January, China reported 140 cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,147 people had developed symptoms as of 20 January 2020.On 26 March, the United States was ahead of China and the Netherlands in the number of reported cases worldwide, with more than 1.61 million cases reported globally on 9 April 2020, more than 97,000 deaths and more than 36,400 recoveries.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
The outbreak in Europe has been contained, with many countries in the Schengen area becoming more open and border controls tightened.
Nationally, detention measures (such as house arrest, house arrest or lockdown) and travel restrictions, as of 2 April, some 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown in the United States, 50 million people are in the Philippines, about 59% of people in South Africa and 1.3 million people in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown. Two days later, that increased to 2.6 billion people - a third of the world's population.
The first known case of the coronavirus was reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
On 31 December 2019, a case of cyniumonia of unknown etology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 27 December 2019, initial genetic tests of the patients confirmed the presence of the coronavirus in the form of SARS-like virus.
The Wuhan Municipal Hospital Commission issued a public warning to residents and on December 31 it issued a warning to the World Health Organization.
The WHO was informed immediately.
When the outbreak occurred, Wuhan police warned doctors about the spread of rumors of an outbreak.
Initially, China's National Health Commission claimed that there was no clear evidence that the virus was transmitted from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a major campaign that was later dubbed the People's War by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, involving the spread of the virus.
The Wuhan quarantine, the largest in human history, was imposed on 23 January by a health service belt that banned all travel to and from Wuhan, and then extended to 15 other cities in Hubei province, affecting approximately 57 million people.
The use of private cars was also banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in most places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hossein Shan Hospital, which was built in ten days.
A second hospital, Li Shen Shan, was subsequently built to care for additional patients.
In addition to building new hospitals, China converted 14 other service areas in Wuhan into temporary hospitals such as association centers and stadiums.On 26 January, the Chinese government introduced other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including health warnings for travellers and an extension of the spring break.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions implemented a number of measures specifically related to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were also implemented in many regions of China.
Restrictions were placed on solo travel and trips to Hubei.
Public transport was restricted and museums were temporarily closed across China.
Public movement was controlled in most cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the total population) were subject to outside restrictions.After the virus outbreak reached global proportions in March, Chinese authorities implemented measures to prevent the virus from entering China from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travelers.On 3 March, only one person had been transferred from Istanbul to Guangzhou in the past five days across China.
On 3 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that the spread of the virus from foreign countries to China had been halted and that the outbreak was under control in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions across Hubei region were lifted after a two-month ban except for Wuhan. On 26 March 2020, China's Foreign Minister announced that visa and residence applications would be suspended from 28 March but did not share specific details on the end of this policy.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa through embassies or consulates in their home countries.
The Chinese government encouraged all businesses and businesses to resume operations on 30 March, and provided financial assistance to businesses.The Chinese State Council set April 4 as a date for national mourning, beginning with a three-minute silence at 10 a.m., although the central government asked families to pay their respects online, taking into account physical distancing due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was transmitted from China to South Korea on 20 January 2020.

Iran's Health Ministry announced the suspension of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and subsequent closures of shrines, while Saudi Arabia also banned foreign pilgrims and its own people from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic, which began after World War II, caused the most delays in the world of sports.
Major sporting events have been cancelled and postponed such as: 20-2019 UEFA Champions League, 20-2019 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 20-2019 NBA season, and 20-2019 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to be held in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced that the Games would be held later than the scheduled date but not later than summer 2021.Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has led to a surge in online gambling, with many online gambling sites reporting increased newcomer traffic to their sites. Gaming and entertainment have also been affected, and several music groups have postponed or cancelled their concerts.
Many major theatres, such as those on Broadway, have postponed their performances.
Some artists have found alternative ways to share their works and performances with the public via the Internet, instead of traditional live performances, such as: live online concerts and web-based events to allow artists to revive and bring their works and performances to the public.
Online, a number of internet notes on the topic of coronavirus have been circulated in the form of jokes and humorous jokes to raise public discontent.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been a profound bias, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent and people of other ethnicities in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been cases of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases of the virus were recorded in China) showed that many people around the world felt a strong sense of ethnic hatred and that Chinese people called it the virus and what happened to them, the punishment for their actions.
Anti-Chinese sentiment was also seen in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support is available for Chinese and regions where the virus is present, both online and offline.
Given the progress of the outbreak in some new countries, people in Italy may also face fear and suspicion, the first European country to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak.People in Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have made efforts to contain the disease and have petitioned for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries.
In Japan, a hashtag was created on Twitter under the name #Chinese-of-Japan-not-coming.
Chinese people in the UK and the US and people from other Asian countries reported increasing levels of racial discrimination and harassment.
US President Donald Trump faced a backlash for his remarks referring to the coronavirus as the Chinese virus, which was described by critics as discriminatory and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign fugitives from Wuhan to Novi Sanjari.
He reported the harassment of Indian students due to the coronavirus outbreak who had come to major cities from the northeastern regions of India bordering China for lessons.
The Bharatiya Janta Party state premier said in a West Bengal dilip that the Chinese destroyed nature so God took revenge on them.
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese Council in Calcutta, which called the statement a mistake.In China, ill-treatment and discrimination against non-Chinese people have intensified due to the pandemic, and Chinese people refer to foreigners as foreign occupiers and want to leave China.
Many newspapers have removed them from some or all of their covers.
Many academic journals have published academic papers on the outbreak that are accessible to everyone.
Some scientists wanted to share their results via pre-functioning servers such as bioRxiv.

Methods are available in laboratories for testing the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease 19-COVID and 2-SARS-CoV viruses by which the presence of the virus is diagnosed and the production of antibodies to the virus is demonstrated.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
In March 2020, the original protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified as a target for post-infection therapy.
It is used to diagnose the most recent and active contaminants.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, both those with mild symptoms and those with symptoms.
The exact death rate and public safety level due to the disease can be determined by the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had accurate data on the spread of the virus among its population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested less than 3% of its population, with most countries having a policy of not testing laboratories with these lower symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
This diversity also greatly influences the mortality rate of reported cases, which may be overestimated in some countries.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are typically available within a few hours to days.
RT-PCR tests performed on colonic samples are only valid in the first week of illness.
The virus can then escape from the neck and enter the lungs.
For those infected who are tested in the second week, alternate samples are taken from their deep respiratory tract using a lethal tube or a cough syringe.
One of the first PCR tests was conducted at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a series of real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) simulations and provided the World Health Organization with the delivery of 250,000 thermometers.
The UK also conducted a test on 23 January 2020.On 28 January 2020, a company in South Korea called Cognitive Biotech developed a clinically-scale device for temperature detection based on PCR and SARS-CoV-2.
It detects E genes and specific SARS-CoV-2 released by the beta coronavirus.BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to receive a license from the National Health Products Administration of China to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 temperature detection instrument.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) time-reported precision diagnostic instrument (RT-PCR) to its public health laboratories through international introduction resources.
One of three genetic tests of older test kits produced inadequate results due to poor performance and a testing halt at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to only 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, tests conducted on two aloe were deemed unsatisfactory, and these tests were not accepted to allow state and local laboratories to test.
These tests were approved by the Food and Drug Administration through an emergency use authorization process.U.S. commercial laboratories began their tests in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that COVID-19 tests are now available nationwide with the benefit of RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostic also made COVID-19 tests available nationwide on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were announced, and sampling and processing must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
COVID-19 tests in Russia were developed and implemented by the State Research Center for Virology and Vector Biotechnology.
The test was registered by the Federal Health Care Administration on February 11, 2020. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic announced a test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received a FDA license for a test that can be performed at a maximum rate of three and a half hours, allowing a machine to perform up to 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of the Abbott m2000 test by Abbott Laboratories; similar licenses had previously been granted by the FDA to several laboratories including Halogen, Lipcorp and Thermomix Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Seafeed also received an emergency use authorisation from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA accepts tests in which thermic nucleic acid amplification technology is used instead of PCR.
This method can diagnose positive results in as little as 5 minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles.
About 18,000 of these machines are now available in the United States and Abbott wants to accelerate production of these machines to 50,000 tests per day.A testing method is being developed in Taiwan that uses a single antibody that binds to the nucleoscaped protein (N protein) of the coronavirus, with hopes that the test will take 15 to 20 minutes like the rapid flu test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "chest radiography has little diagnostic value in the early stages of the disease, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be present even before the onset of symptoms".
Bi-directional glaucoma is common in emerging, heterogeneous and recent diseases.
Subpulmonary dominance and crazies (sliding of the athlete's curtains with variable filling of the pulmonary alveoli or orifices), and coagulation may occur as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wuhan suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its reactions overlapping with other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a first-line test or screening tool for COVID-19 diagnosis".As of March 2020, WHO proposed the following definitions of cases:
Part of the immune response to the germ is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These cases are used to monitor people, determine immune systems, and diagnose those who have had symptoms in the first 7 days or longer.Tests can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or through a point-of-care test (PoCT).
Highly automated systems in most clinical laboratories will have the capabilities to perform tests but their availability will depend on the cost of production for each system.
A single screen blood sample is commonly used for CLT, although continuous samples are used for immune system response.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually taken by perforating the skin.
Unlike the PCR method, no pre-test discharge phase is required.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named twenty-nine companies that had provided notice to the agency as required and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA through an emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Eurovision Medical Diagnostics Laboratory and Epitoyp Diagnostics Laboratories received European approval for their test suite, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples per hour and is therefore much faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the disease.In early April, the UK found that none of their purchased diagnostic devices were useful.
Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they insult him, send him back and will receive a test result a little later. The British NHS has announced that it is running a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient being hospitalized if they arrive or an ambulance is needed to disarm.
In-car diagnostic centers have helped South Korea to test faster and more extensively than other countries.In Germany, the National Association of Forensic Health Physicists said on 2 March that it has a capacity of around 12,000 tests through Planetary Diagnostics and that 10,700 tests had been taken in the past week.
When the desist is requested by a doctor, the costs are covered by the health insurance.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, testing was proposed in several major cities.
The total number of tests performed as of 26 March 2020 was not known as only positive case figures were being released.
A preliminary survey of laboratories showed that as of week 2020/12, a total of at least 483,295 tests had been performed and 33,491 samples (6.9%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus, including this week.In Israel, researchers at Tekken and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients at a time, which is done by combining multiple samples, and performing more tests in case of a positive case in the combined samples.On 5 February 2020, a process called BGI Fire Detection (火眼) was launched in Wuhan, China, at a facility covering 2000 square meters in an area of 2,000 square meters.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jin and taking 5 days, modeling shows that cases in Hubei had increased by 47% and the cost associated with quarantine resolution would have doubled if this testing capacity had not been raised at the same time.
The Wuhan lab was immediately followed by Huayan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in all 12 cities in China.
The capacity of the tests as of 4 March 2020 was 50,000 tests per day.Open source, designs shared by Origami Assay have been released that can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests.These parallel designs can be performed in small laboratories without the need for a mechanical fluid collector.
By March, introduction shortages and insufficient doses had become a problem for mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Some authors have been forced to investigate sampling protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing more of its population per capita for coronavirus than any other country, and has reached the level of testing that has tested the most of its population.
This was through a combination of patient-location capability, and purchasing a population-wide mass-testing laboratory from the 42 and BGI groups (based on Wei's "Ho-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory set up in 14 days is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first worldwide laboratory to perform tests at such a scale operating outside of China.
The genetic profiling of the coronavirus by targeting different parts and performing different screening procedures was developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has sent a German approach to developing kits to countries with low income and no resources to produce kits themselves.
The German policy was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not established until 28 January, suspending testing available in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts to conduct tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the availability of extensive testing facilities in South Korea has helped to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Large-scale testing capacity in private sector laboratories was built by the South Korean government over a period of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for speeding up testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.High demands for testing due to the spread of the virus have led to a buildup of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories across the United States, and the supply of swabs and chemicals has been strained.
In March 2020, China reported an accuracy problem in its testing kits.
In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC had "shortcomings" after which the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented tests from being conducted by private laboratories.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Biotechnology Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but later found that the results were not accurate.
The company responded that the erroneous results could be due to a problem in collecting samples or improper use of the kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would return the kits that had false results, and instead receive the heterogeneous test kits from Shenzhen Bioice Company.The Czech Republic, which purchased test kits from China, returned 80% of them with false results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China after which the results were found to be false.
Prime Minister Matthias suggested that it should be changed to the Danube. Atish Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that there were "high-level errors" in the test kits purchased by Turkey from China and "did not take advantage of them".The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that the purchased kits were not usable.
Tests that result in positive results, patients who were quarantined and those who were followed up with contacts who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 have positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, double-checked the entire population of about 3,400 people about ten days apart.
Almost half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected patients were quarantined.
Due to limited travel to the community, the new disease was completely eradicated.
Following the sudden contacts, with restrictions on inbound travel, inspections, and quarantines, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore is progressing much more slowly than in other developed countries, and there are no severe restrictions such as forced closures on restaurants and retail outlets.
Many ceremonies were canceled, and Singapore advised people to stay at home until 28 March, but schools reopened in time after the 23 March holiday.
A number of other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed the disease with sudden contact tracing, restrictions on internal travel, inspections, and quarantines, but with low levels of lockdown or tourism.
One statistical study found that in terms of mortality, the death rate is much lower in countries that have more testing, perhaps because those countries are better able to identify people with few or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries without testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to the 16 WHO reference laboratories for testing confirmation.
Of the 16 laboratories of the Centre, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "Positive as % of tests" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who visit hospitals has a higher positive percentage of tests than a country that tests the entire population, whether people have symptoms or not, but other things being equal.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap regularly at "important moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and diarrhea, which are transmitted from hand to mouth by contact materials.
People can also contract respiratory illnesses such as the flu or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose and mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five most sensitive times of day when handwashing with soap is important are: before and after flushing, after cleaning the bottom of the child or changing the pump, before feeding the child, before feeding and before and after preparing food or after touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can also be washed with a soap. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing in the following situations:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after patient care.
After changing diapers or cleaning babies who have defecated.
After snoring, coughing or sneezing.
After handling animals, pet food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene habits associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before prescribing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary health purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or illness.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is an important practice for all people.
Hand washing has many health benefits, such as reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory diseases;
and reduce the rate of infant mortality at birth in homes.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing habits may lead to small improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple habit changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea cases by nearly a third, and this is linked to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea incidence can be attributed to handwashing with soap.Handwashing with soap is the only effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), if the practice is automated in homes, schools and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, a major component of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, making it a regular habit to wash hands before meals and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical procedure, and reduce by half the deaths from pneumonia and by a quarter the deaths from respiratory infections.
Handwashing is often linked to other forms of health care as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against dead particles that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
The only minor adverse effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, itchy skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also known as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when handwashing with soap is important in reducing the transmission of infections from contaminated materials to the mouth: after using the toilet (to relieve discomfort or defecation), after cleaning the bottom of the child (changing the pump), before feeding the child, before and after feeding and preparing food and after or after touching raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Situations where proper handwashing techniques should be used to prevent transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after burning the nose, coughing and sneezing; after handling animal waste or other animal waste; and after touching other litter.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that the rate was highest at 97% in Saudi Arabia; the average is nearly 77% in the United States; and the lowest is 23% in China. Numerous methods of habit modification are now available to increase the habit of handwashing with soap at key times. Mass handwashing of school children at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries that encourages children to practice handwashing.
The "Health Care Essentials Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a scale-up of action to promote children's health and educational development.
Treatment of gingivitis twice a year, along with daily hand washing with soap, daily fluoride tooth brushing are the main goals of this national program.
The program is also being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the impurities in the solution, and to increase the solubility.
Water alone is not effective in cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are part of the body's metabolism, do not dissolve easily in water.
Proper water flow only helps with cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable properties, may preserve bacteria obtained from previous uses.
A few studies that looked at bacterial transmission from contaminated solid soaps concluded that such transmission is unlikely because the bacteria are purified with soap foam.
The CDC still says "it is best to use liquid soap for clean hand-contact control for use by more people".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted among health conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant or non-antibiotic prescriptions used are superior to antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antimicrobial soaps contain common antimicrobials such as triclosan, which has a wide list of resistant forms against the organism.
So if antibiotic-resistant variants are not selected for antimicrobial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed to be.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, as pH regulators, complex formulations such as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin conditions (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) may contain acidic acidity (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid).A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health suggests that simple soaps are as effective at preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands as consumer grade antibacterial soaps that contain triclosan.
Hot water that is suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
But in removing natural fats that contain soil and bacteria, hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing microbial stress on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer without water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizer antiseptics, or hand sanitizers) gained popularity.
Most rely on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed in a gel with a thick substance such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid), or a haemocanthate such as glycerin in liquid, or foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Spraying a thick liquid of hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective at killing germs.
Alcoholic sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRRE), rabies, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-containing hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (a decrease of 3.5 lag, equivalent to a decrease of 35 decibel) after 30 seconds of washing hands and kill 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 lag decrease) of bacteria 1 minute after washing hands.
Alcohol-containing hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against the neurovirus (or norvac) type viruses that are the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Hands should be treated with sufficient antiseptic or alcohol to allow both hands to dry or dry properly.
Wash the sanitizer on the face and back of the hands and between and at the ends of all fingers for about 30 seconds to allow the liquid, foam or gel to dry.
The tips of the fingers should also be thoroughly washed, and washed to both feet.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing with hand sanitizer, especially when hands are very wet.
The overuse of such materials depends on their ease of use and quick killing function against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless a skin softener or moisturizer formula is used.
The skin-drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with softening agents caused less skin itching and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergent.
Contact sensitivity to dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or severe sensitivity to alcohol or excessive alcohol in hand washing are rare.
The lower propensity for itchy irritation with dermatitis has become noticeable compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless materials do not remove organic matter from hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends greatly on the ingredients and composition, and have historically been used less than alcohol and alcohol on the hands.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have long-lasting and higher antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, and reduced efficacy after repeated use, possibly due to persistent adverse reactions on the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use soap or dirt instead.
Soil or soil may be more effective without water but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or areas are contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, urea is also an disinfectant because, when combined with water, it forms an alkali solution.
The World Health Organization recommends soap or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
The proper handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission consists of the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended as standing water in a bowl may be contaminated, while water temperature does not cause a difference.
Wash hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails, with plenty of soap and detergent.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research shows that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when they have soap instead of just water to wash their hands.
Wash it for at least 20 seconds.
Moisture creates a lubricant, which helps remove germs from the skin, and moisture for long periods of time removes more germs.
Wash it thoroughly under running water.
Can be re-contaminated by washing hands in a bowl.
Dry your hands with a clean towel or hold them in an air dryer.
Wet and damp hands can be easily re-damaged. The most commonly leftover areas of the hand are the thumb, wrist, interfingers and under fingernails.
Artificial nails and polished nails may give rise to microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of transmission of the disease.
In developing countries, where tap water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost options can be developed to facilitate handwashing, for example, flushing water from a hanging bush or pumpkin with a suitable syringe and/or using a spray if necessary. In situations where water supplies are limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are then water conservation solutions, such as "tap tapes or sprayed bushes" and other low-cost options.
Tippy-tap or tipped-top is a simple technique in which a tip is tapped with a rope, and a foot-operated stick drips a small amount of water on the hands and soap is available along with it.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Large-scale research suggests that paper towels found in many toilets are healthier than electric hand dryers.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, funded by the papermaking industry called the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels recommended by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and other advanced jet air hand dryers.
After hand washing and hand drying with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% on the fingertips and 254% on the palms.
Drying hands with a jet air dryer led to an average increase of 42% in the total number of bacteria on the fingertips and 15% in the wrist.
After hand washing and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average by up to 76% on the fingertips and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether any method of drying resulted in potential contamination between other bathroom users and the bathroom environment.
The jet ventilator, which is claimed to expel air at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially polluting other toilet users and the environment of the toilets up to 2 metres away.
A hot air hand dryer releases microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the machine.
No specific release of microorganisms was observed in paper towels. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels in terms of hand drying.
Using wet hand sanitizer wipes for hand washing is an alternative when travelling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after a Hungarian doctor named Ignaz Semmelweis found hand washing effective in preventing illness in a hospital setting (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget to do so.
One study found that their use reduced infection rates.
The medical hand washing procedure is for at least 15 seconds, and sufficient soap and water or gel should be used to soak and all parts of the hands should be washed.
Hands should be washed by inserting the fingers of both hands into each other.
If there is a lump under the fingernails, a brush should be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain on hands in water, it is important to wash hands thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to stop the water (and if necessary, the exit door can also be opened with paper).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands from those areas.
The purpose of hand washing in a healthcare facility is to kill pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the rate of hand washing is at an unacceptable level in many medical settings, with many doctors and nurses consistently forgetting to wash their hands before contact with patients, and thus transmitting germs.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related vascular disease by 66 percent.The World Health Organization published a paper outlining standard practices for hand washing and hand rubbing in health care sectors.
The WHO has also published a draft hand hygiene guideline on its website for public comment.
A related review was conducted by Whitby and his colleagues.
Commercial tools can measure and verify hand hygiene, if necessary to demonstrate compliance with regulations.
According to the World Health Organization, hand washing should be done in the following "five circumstances":
After contact with blood/body fluids
Before performing disinfection work, and
After treatment of the patient. Adding an anti-infective chemical to soap ("medical" or "anti-microbial" soap) gives the hand washing agent a lethal force.
This type of microbial killing may be required before surgery or in medical facilities where antibiotic-resistant organisms are most likely to spread. To clean one's hands for surgical operations, a hose that is turned on and off without touching the hands, some chloroxide or washing iodine, a sanitary towel to dry hands after washing, a sanitary brush for shaving and a sanitary towel to clean the underside of the fingers are required.
All jewelry must be removed.
This method requires hand washing for 2-6 minutes.
Washing hands for a long time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When water is poured, water should be avoided from the side to the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands should be dried with a healthy towel, and the surgical dressing should be washed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after treating an ill person.
For the control of Staphylococcal disease in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand washing was found to come from the first 20% of hand washing and the least additional benefit was obtained when hand washing frequency was increased to more than 35%.
Washing hands with plain soap causes three times more transmission of bacterial infections to food than washing with antimicrobial soap. Blowing an alcoholic solution on the hands for an average of 30 seconds and washing hands with antimicrobial soap compared with that has been shown to reduce microbial contamination by 26% more than an antimicrobial soap.
Soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand washes at reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and clusteryldehyde spores from hands.However, improvements in hand hygiene in healthcare facilities may include educating employees about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand washes, and providing written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these approaches are most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and essential means of achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has led to the challenge of making handwashing a universal universal practice.
For example, handwashing faucets near private or public toilets are rare in many rural areas of Africa, while inexpensive options for installing handwashing facilities are available.
However, low rates of hand washing can be more likely to be the result of a poorly established habit than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to a change in people's long-standing habits.
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary for this to be effective.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based attitudes are effective in increasing handwashing habits in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of handwashing promotion in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can eventually go from one star to three stars.
Establishing handwashing sites can be part of handwashing promotion campaigns conducted to reduce disease and infant mortality rates.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to achieve a habit change goal. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis.
A few studies have considered the overall impact of handwashing costs associated with the prevention of DALYs in developing countries.
However, one review suggested that promoting handwashing with soap is much cheaper than other methods of water and sanitation.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have recently given birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two of the leading doctors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Agnaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale who was English and is considered "the founder of modern nursing".
Many people at the time believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called mesmosis.
In the 1980s, foodborne illness and health care-associated infections forced the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, posters titled "Proper Handwashing Techniques" have been hung near toilets in public toilets and in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands" from an object means that one expresses dissatisfaction with taking responsibility for one's object or is complicit in the crime.
The text originates from the Gospel message in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to execute Jesus Christ but has become a widely used phrase in English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth is forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clear the imaginary stain she saw on her being, which represents her guilty conscience about the crimes she committed and encourages her husband to do the same.
It has also been found that people, after recalling or contemplating immoral acts, are forced to wash their hands more often than at other times, and place more value on handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after thinking this way are less likely to engage in other compulsory "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both sanitary and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, i.e. using water to wash hands without soap, is part of the ritual of hand washing in many religions such as the Baha'i Faith, Hinduism, Twelver and Nitlatheim in Judaism, Lhasa in Christianity, and Yad Vashem in Islam. Religions also recommend healthy hand washing especially after certain rituals.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam all mandate hand washing before and after meals.
COVID-19 risk control measures in the workplace
COVID-19 risk control measures at work include the use of occupational safety and health methods to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Consideration of workplace risk control measures, risk assessment of sources of infection, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for each worker who may be at risk of contracting COVID-19, depending on the workplace and job.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends that low-risk occupations have minimal contact with people and other workers, which is recommended to prevent by taking primary prevention measures. Primary prevention measures include hand washing, telling employees to stay home if they are sick, taking measures to prevent respiratory transmission, and cleaning and disinfecting the work environment on a daily basis.
Jobs with a moderate risk of infection are those that require sustained and close contact with strangers and people who are suspected of COVID-19, but may become ill due to ongoing social transmission and international travel.
This work environment includes workers who are in contact with people, such as schools, crowded work environments, and crowded retail outlets.
In addition to primary prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include effective air filtering ventilation, plastic or glass blinds, personal protective equipment or devices as you may be exposed to someone who is infected with COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) suggests that healthcare and funeral workers who work with COVID-19 infected and suspected individuals are at higher risk of infection. Where workers apply airborne particulate matter prevention procedures to COVID-19 infected and suspected individuals and collect or use samples from them for testing, they are at higher risk of infection.
Risk control measures that are appropriate for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and job-appropriate personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a number of effects on the workplace.
Employees may not attend work because of illness, the need to protect the privacy of others, and fear of contracting the disease.
The business model may change. These may vary both with the demand for goods and the means by which they are obtained (e.g., shopping at a discount, or delivering/delivering to the customer on your own or providing instant services by car/motorcycle).
Finally, the routes of transportation of goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be cut.Epidemic preparedness and response plans can be used to guide safe measures.
Plans address various workplace and occupational risk levels, including sources of infection, risk factors from home, and social spaces and risk factors for older workers and workers with persistent health conditions.
Also, the plans outline control measures to address the risks and provide potential plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may require national and regional recommendations.
The response to an outbreak of an infectious disease aims to reduce the rate of transmission of disease among workers, save people at risk of more complex health conditions, maintain work activities, and minimize side effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where business activities are conducted affects the response.
The hierarchy of risk control measures is the framework, widely used to classify risk control measures during the course of their effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
In places where COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls, without relying on the worker's input, are a way to alert workers to work-related hazards, and are perhaps the most cost-effective way to implement this work.
Administrative controls are changes in labor policies or practices that require action by the employee and manager.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineered and administrative controls, but can sometimes help prevent disease.
All forms of personal protective equipment must be selected based on the risk posed to the worker, properly installed (e.g., respirators), continuously and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced if necessary, and must be properly removed, cleaned, and maintained or disposed of to prevent contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that low-risk occupations have low workplace contact with people and colleagues.
Primary prevention measures, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand washing, telling employees to stay home if sick, preventing respiratory transmission of disease, including cough and wheezing, providing bedding for paper towels and used items, being prepared to handle telephone calls or change shifts if necessary, preventing employees from using other tools and equipment, and keeping work equipment clean and disinfected on a daily basis.
The most important step in protecting workers, customers, observers, and others in the workplace is the early identification and isolation of potential infected individuals.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until their fever is reduced for at least 24 hours with the use of fever reducers or anti-symptomatic medications, symptoms are relieved, and other symptoms resolve.Leave policies should be flexible, employees should be allowed to care for sick members at home, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with a moderate risk of infection include those that are in close contact with people who are not infected or suspected of COVID-19, within 6 feet (1.8 m) of each other, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 through community transmission around workplaces or through recent international travel to a location where COVID-19 has been widely reported.
These include workers who are in general contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, or retail stores or locations with high numbers of customers.The need for these and high-risk groups includes engineering controls, effective installation of air filters, air conditioners, installation of physical barriers such as clear plastic screens and equipment, providing emergency services from car/motorcycle service providers, and providing information on the health of patients at risk.We recommend that these and high-risk workplaces be equipped with effective patient control systems to ensure that patients are able to plan for safe work, including using personal protective equipment, wearing masks, wearing a mask, and other measures to prevent contact with people at risk of COVID-19, including: making contact with people who are at risk, making contact with a trained healthcare provider, providing information on how to stay in contact with them, and providing advice on how to use personal protective equipment, including contact lenses, contact lenses, contact lenses, and/or contact lenses, and/or other measures to prevent infection, including:
Workers in this high-risk group require very little respiratory care.
If someone is ill on board, appropriate controls for the safety of crew and other passengers include isolating other passengers and staff by maintaining a 6-foot distance from others, recommending the sick person wear a mask, and asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing and sneezing.
Cabin passengers should use disposable medical hand sanitizer when caring for a sick passenger or touching liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if possible use other personal protective equipment if a sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Handbags and disposable items should be packed in red/danger bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.Transportation and transfer risk controls on commercial vessels, including cargo ships and other passenger vessels, include postponing the voyage when someone is ill, and isolating anyone on board with a fever or other symptoms of illness and informing medical personnel on board immediately.
In principle, this is done under medical supervision in the quarantine person's cabin. For schools and child care centers, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a temporary school holiday for cleaning and disinfection, if an infected person has been to school regardless of the social spread of the disease.
Where there is little chance of reducing social transmission, social distancing strategies should be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, meetings and other large gatherings, such as physical education or church meetings or cafeteria parties, increasing distance between tables, changing arrival and departure times, limiting/minimizing unnecessary visitors, and using separate health office space for children with symptoms such as fever.
When transmission continues strongly in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers emergency health risk levels to be low for law enforcement personnel, who perform daily activities and duties.
Law enforcement officials, who may have come into contact with COVID-19 infected or suspected persons, are advised to follow relevant instructions, including appropriate personal protective equipment, as well as emergency medical personnel.
If in close contact during detention, personnel should clean and disinfect their belts and military clothing with homemade disinfectant sprays before second use, and follow standard operating procedures/procedures for the maintenance and disposal of used personal protective equipment and the maintenance and washing of clothing.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) suggests that healthcare and funeral workers are at higher and higher risk of contracting the disease.
Highly exposed jobs include healthcare providers, laboratory, and medical transportation workers who are exposed to people with and suspected of COVID-19.
Where workers apply procedures to prevent the production of airborne particles to persons infected or suspected of COVID-19, or collect or use samples from them for testing, they are putting the risk of infection at a higher level.
Procedures to prevent the production of airborne particles include intravenous tubing, cough drops, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, often with the collection of samples.
Funeral services with a high risk of infection include those who prepare the bodies of people who are known to have or are suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of death. If these workers perform autopsies, their risk of infection increases significantly. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include isolation of rooms for COVID-19 infection and suspected patients, as well as procedures to prevent the production of particles in the air.
A specific negative pressure ventilator may be appropriate in some healthcare and funeral homes.
Samples should be taken with Biosafety Level 3 precautions in mind.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that future patients be placed in a separate waiting room in case of suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition to other personal protective equipment, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends respirators for workers who work within 6 feet of SARS-CoV-2 infected or suspected patients and workers who perform airborne particulate matter production prevention procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-certified N95 face masks or better should be used in an extensive and written respiratory safety program.
Other types of respirators can be used for better safety and provide convenience for the worker.The World Health Organization does not recommend covering, as COVID-19 is a respiratory illness.The disease is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only medical masks for screening personnel at the door.
The World Health Organization recommends surgical masks, glasses, face masks, medical clothing and gloves for those who take respiratory samples, care for COVID-19 patients or transport them from one place to another without any prevention procedures to prevent the production of particulate matter in the air.
If a procedure to prevent the production of airborne particles is performed, an N95 or FFP2 respirator mask should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Because global availability of PPE is inadequate, the WHO recommends establishing remote health and physical barriers such as, clean windows, reducing the need for PPE, allowing only those who care directly for COVID-19 patients to use PPE, only for specific essential tasks, such as for same-sex patients to use PPE without removing a respiratory mask when caring for them, monitoring and supporting the supply/supply chain of PPE, and recommending that masks not be prescribed to people with symptoms.

Topic line: [COVID-19] Lightening the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of release: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
This month we find ourselves in a very difficult situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that has highlighted and highlighted our global inter-human relationships and the responsibilities we have towards one another.
We have no precedent for these challenges, but we know that our best response depends on a kind of global compassion, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The cooperation and attention we have had among our colleagues through emails, calls, and online conversations is a testament to the incredible trust and confidence of these amazing people who are so lucky to work alongside us.
I cannot thank you enough and I am proud to consider you my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They showed me how meaningful news it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia, and how powerful a symbol it is as an important resource that is online and accessible to all.
It is your job to decide whether you want to keep the site open, take money from contributors, or keep the community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides more than ever.
It's the moment when not what we do or how we do it, but maybe the world has a meaningful impact.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Keep up with your work and schedule
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team had a meeting last night to discuss our strategy and schedule for the coming days and months.
In these discussions, we considered what we thought would be the most appropriate response to what we were facing and in the meantime the best way to keep the organization or institution stable and strong.
We were very keen to relieve pressure and support our mission in the long term.
If you want to dial it again, no problem.
For all employees, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectation is, until further notice, 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We don't have any holidays  If you can work longer than normal, the mission can use you.
But still, the world is not so predictable right now, and your well-being is our priority, whether you take care of your plight, buy groceries for the house or go to the doctor.
We don't monitor your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should be done without saying, but we tell you.
No need for sick leave or PTO  Just tell your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure key parts of the job are covered.
(If you test positive for COVID-19, please notify Brian T&C Ops know so T&C who can help you and ensure your condition is properly addressed by management.)
Hourly workers are paid their full wages.
We have said before and again that we respect the commitment of our contractors and hourly workers.
Each will be paid on the basis of their normal hours under normal circumstances.
If you are ill and unable to work, this includes.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people around us use their work as a way to relieve stress.
What we do is incredibly rewarding, especially at a time like this.
Again, this means taking care of yourself.
The request is that you talk to your manager, that you know what to expect and adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered important.
There are some things we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security and Capital Raising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional assistance.
We will begin a process with all agencies to review current objectives and focus on supporting what is important to our mission.
There are many agencies that do it for us, we should all focus on the most important projects.
For now, the pain is not caused by walking.
We do not plan to "double the time to prepare" once the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to do this extra work to satisfy the multiplicative algebra, because this work is now imaginary and unrealistic.
We recognize that the situation has changed, and we must work to set new goals and timetables.
What happens with annual planning?
To adapt to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule to present our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan, which creates more time for budgeting and provides employees with the opportunity to prioritize critical work, self-care, compassionate care, while replacing those who want to work on reduced schedules in the coming weeks.
Scheduling extensions greatly reduce the current workload and stress of planning throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the board next week and update the delegations and teams on the new measures as they receive approval.
Thanks to the leadership of the APP team in this regard.
Office status, illness, and hygiene
Last week, we received news that our SF-related staff may have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, following a series of precautions, we hired an anti-virus cleanup team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect every surface as well as lobbies and elevator surfaces that reach our floor.
Care duties in the building are carried out using protocol and materials that contribute to the safety of tenants.
We feel reassured that the office will be ready when we return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared COVID-19 protocols with us and DC-related staff.
As of last week, our DC office has been completely relocated to a remote location in accordance with a shared guidance with San Francisco.
As our relevant colleagues in New York City know, we discuss and discuss the rental of a space in Brooklyn among ourselves.
The talks are ongoing, but there may be delays.
Some of our colleagues are working in remote areas for the first time.
Our long-term remote colleagues understand that this can be a form of order and order, and would like to offer you some greetings:
Limit the length of sessions to one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider how the meeting can be broken up into several parts over the course of several days.
Clearly state the purpose of the meeting, include an agenda, and send out the reading material before the meeting.
Download videos on Google Docs and Zoom to create live help, collaboration and contact.
Designate a leader to structure each meeting. Someone to oversee discussions on questions and follow up on the list of speakers and someone to help take notes (or take notes collectively).
If you need a quiet microphone or headphones, send an email to the tech support.
Use your welfare payment for breakfast.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about shared work.
The Human Resources Activities team reviews webinar-based ergonomics guides to support distributed workflows throughout the base.
Last week we asked community contractors to cancel public programs funded by Wikimedia, such as EditToons, until the pandemic is declared over by the World Health Organization.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to perform their contractual activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or changing the purpose of such activities.
We will start monitoring further guidelines for Wikimedia and other regional and community themed conferences next week.
The general sense of the international community seems to be distraught by the chaos, but calm and comfortable in its clarity and ability to focus on its communities, Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working on creating a page on MetaWiki to create a space for the community to monitor the impact and track our interactions with them.
Dealing with COVID-19-related topics
We will send an invitation to your office for a special working meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional new information, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are in this together and if we can help each other in this way.
In addition, you can continue to find information at this email address and find other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will update the information on these pages and keep all the information in one place.
We also work to maintain ongoing contact with staff who are currently living in the most affected countries.
If you have questions about such a trip, programs, major workflow, coverage-related challenges, or anything else you need help with, you can no doubt get in touch with CRT or work with them.
We want to provide assistance and establish contacts if needed.
If you have confidential and sensitive information, please email Brian Jordan, Head of Global Human Resources Operations.
No change should be seen as a waiver of work and responsibilities.
It is a recognition that at a time when our work and responsibilities need to be structured in ways that were not previously possible.
These are steps we believe are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue our work, manage our operations with the help they need and manage the world with a service they can trust.
Our planned work will be waiting for us in time.
For now it is time to support each other and create the atmosphere for the important work that may be faced in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need you to achieve this goal, and we ask you to take care of yourself and your families, so that you are ready and able to respond to emergencies.
Now please  Wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (in Amanda, Amy V., Brian J., Doreen D., Gregory V., Jim V., Joel L., Lynette L., Ryan M., and Tony S.), and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W., Jim V., Janine Y., Lisa S., Robin A., Ryan M., and Toby Ann).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing angiotensin II levels and increasing Ang ((1-7)), thus making it a promising drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc, a metalloenzyme, that is localized on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an M2 domain of N-terminal peptides and a C-terminal clearin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain, and is expressed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 outer domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shidas, and the final soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted through the urine or feces.
ACE2 is present in many organs: ACE2 is bound to the primary lung type II alveolar cells, small intestinal endothelial cells, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The ACE2 mRNA form is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a balancer for ACE.
ACE is a vasoconstrictor that secretes angiotensin II into the angiotensin II hormone.
ACE2, in turn, isolates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and converts it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also secrete a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9] - bradykinin, epinephrine, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane that is the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is implicated in cardiac arrest.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses into cells, such as HCoV-NL63;SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); andSARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 proteins to the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and transmission of both viruses and enzymes that reside in cells.
This entry process also requires the provision of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, which is currently under investigation as a potential treatment. This has led some to speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight disease.
However, many professional societies and regulatory agencies have recommended continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB treatment.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those who had had strokes and heart disease.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Human synthesis of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulse hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes, with an effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those who are intolerant of classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where angiotensin II is elevated.
b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software apps designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, e.g., the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Various apps were developed or offered with official support from governments in some regions and jurisdictions.
Many frameworks have been developed to build contact tracking apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding systems built based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
A few annoying alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to allow the user to log in to other cell phones as they approach.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would jointly support these Bluetooth-based apps to work directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The app was developed by the IT Regional Association, published as open source and will be submitted to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "StopKorona!" that detects contact with potential patients and provides a rapid response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was pending approval by the Google Play Store and the App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that a contact tracking app is in the final stages of development, and will be available in a few weeks.Similar apps are also planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia plans to introduce a geofencing app in Moscow for patients with COVID-19, and the format is designed to ensure they do not leave the house.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive results and a potential lack of effectiveness if app use is limited to only a small fraction of people.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set restrictions on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store. It has restricted this to only "official" or, in other words, reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the effects of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The above organizations announced eight conditions for government projects:
Supervision must be "lawful, compulsory and proportionate";
Extension of supervision and surveillance must have a lack of termination;
Use of data will be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Information security and uncertainty must be protected and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should prevent discrimination and exclusion;
Sharing of information with third parties should be defined in law;
Safeguards against abuse and regarding citizens' rights must be in place to respond to abuse;
Meaningful participation is required by all "interested parties", including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Computer Club of Disorder (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published checklists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan aims to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing tracking mechanisms from their device operating systems when no longer needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of an app, which eliminated the need to download an app and has the ability to prevent tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was adopted.
Network-based solutions that access raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all centralized systems need to have centralized servers to access private location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been built that use centralized servers only for internal communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an app-free system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking data from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to notify potentially infected individuals via SMS.
In addition to using this information to notify potential contacts, the government has also made public access to location information available, which has been allowed due to the extensive changes in data privacy laws since the MERS outbreak in the country.
People can access this information through a number of apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, use centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of 6 April 2020, no details have been released yet.
Privacy-protected contact tracking is an established good idea, with a substantial body of research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, dozens of groups of experts were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect users to other mobile phones as they approach.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has both centralized and decentralized approaches and does not have a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity privacy protection tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact event numbers, CEN), privacy sensitivity protocols and mobile communication tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all comparisons are made on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is a platform based on research published in a March 2020 white paper titled "Apps Gone Wrong: Protecting Personal Privacy in a Pandemic".A similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies and was originally developed at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses hardware-safe technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising the confidentiality of that information.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by a number of groups that brought together similar approaches and broadly based protocols aimed at simplifying analytics, and facilitating global collaboration in tracking and alerting apps, a key aspect of achieving the goal of wide use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol open source for use by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for connection tracking, which they claim will protect privacy and will be based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be implemented in three phases:
Launching tools so governments can create official privacy-protecting coronavirus tracking apps
Directly integrate this functionality into the iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to address the start-up and continuation problems of monitoring by first deploying the system through an operating system update and then in the same manner when the threat has ended by removing data.
Rather than treating the disease for which it was originally developed, drug position changes (also known as drug use for another purpose, re-profiling, re-assignment or change of therapy) refers to the reuse of an approved drug to treat another disease or medical condition.
This is a line of scientific research currently being pursued to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other directions of research include developing a COVID-19 vaccine and intravenous plasma delivery.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug-reversible proteins, each with multiple ligand binding points.
Analysis of these closure points provides a suitable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papin-like proteases, RNA-related RNA polymers, helices, S-proteins, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain A. and colleagues studied a number of selectable compounds, which they then optimized and analyzed to find skeletal similarities to the most similarly accepted drugs, to accelerate the development of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in a preclinical study and to propose a clinical research design.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State's trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment of these drugs has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is approved by the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use only in patients who are hospitalized but are not treatable in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been determined.
Doctors said they would continue to use the drug until they "had no other choice".
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major research is underway at Duke and Oxford Universities.
NYU Langone Medical School conducts a trial on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed and shown that faviprovir is a "clearly effective" drug.

The use of the medication may not be safe for pregnant women or those planning to become pregnant.
A study of lupinavir/ritonavir (Calitra), a combination of antiviral lupinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "there is no benefit".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from re-attaching to the prostate.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to refine the drug to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protein.There is criticism in the scientific community against those who direct resources to provide other accepted drugs to treat the disease, especially those developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization also included the drug lopinavir/ritonavir in the Global Alliance trial.
Remdesivir was developed and manufactured by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later found that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several phyllo-, pneumo-, paramexo- and coronaviruses.
An issue with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some pre-trial research suggests that remdesivir may be a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, two of which are being conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one on people with moderate disease and the other on people with more severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C are underway on people who are hospitalized and have severe COVID-19 disease; two are placebo-controlled (China, Canada), and one is uncontrolled (Italy).

Also tested in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019.
Although clinical trials on any vaccine have not been completed, many efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In February 2020, the World Health Organization said that the organization did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a related or causative virus, to be developed in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccine candidates in Phase I safety trials.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The worldwide outbreak reached a peak in 2020, which led to significant investment and research activity in developing a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the released genome to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
As revealed in April, CEPI's innovation requirements for vaccine development include speed, manufacturing capacity, the availability of a defined amount of data, and global access.
In April, scientists reported that as of early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that were developed in the Phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I promoter and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase 1 developer and vaccine candidate: Cancinobiologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 39 more announced but with little public data available (believed to be under planning or in the design phase).
A Phase I-II trial, which is a primary safety and immunogenicity trial, is generally randomized, placebo-controlled, and conducted at multiple sites/sites, while also determining the most accurate and effective doses/treatments.
Phase III trials typically have multiple participants. These participants include a control group, the efficacy of a vaccine trial to prevent disease, while monitoring for side effects at the desired dose/treatment.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development approved as of early April 2020, 74 have not been tested in human trials (still in pre-clinical trials).
Around 24 April 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that the university was investigating a possible vaccine containing a molecule that genetically alters viral proteins to induce an immune response.

In late March, the Government of Canada announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures against COVID-19, including a number of selective vaccines at Canadian companies and universities such as the University of Chicago and Saskatchewan Initiatives.
Meanwhile, the Government of Canada announced a C$192 million grant specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.This includes plans to create a "vaccine bank" of various new vaccines to be used in case of an outbreak/development of another variant of the coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Petersburg Medical School reported on the trials of Petkovak. It is a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice. The report stated that, "MNA provided SARS-CoV-2S1 second-line vaccines that induced stronger specific antibody responses to the antigen [in mice] that emerged within 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced a possible nasal spray design for a DNA-selective vaccine.

In March 2020, the United States government, industry, and three universities joined forces and shared their resources to acquire supercomputers from IBM, including cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as adverse events/side effects.
This means they can have benefits beyond disease prevention.
Australia is seeking to recruit 4170 health workers for Lanuro randomized trials.
It is possible that a vaccine under development is not safe and effective.
Preliminary studies to evaluate vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-related animal models, such as ACA2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human mammals require international coordination to ensure that Level 3 biosafety measures and standard safety procedures are in place to control live viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human or animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine for the treatment or safety of SARS has yet been developed that has been shown to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to studies published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for all governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS was released, it was believed that existing MERS research might provide a viable model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was only one DNA-based MERS vaccine that had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three more are in development. All vaccines are viral-transmitter vaccines, two others are adenoviral-Victorid or ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac, and one is MERS-CoV-S.
Social media posts have promoted conspiracy theories claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not previously known and that a vaccine was not previously available.
The patented inventions cited by numerous social media posts provided the source of available inventions for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS-CoV-2, genetic sequences and vaccines.
Coronavirus disease B 2019 or COVID-19 is an infectious disease that causes the symptomatic coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory illness.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and diarrhea.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, neck pain, loss of smell, and chest pains.
The incubation period and onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may range from two to 14 days.
While most cases are normal, some include viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases had been reported from 210 countries and territories worldwide, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is initially spread through close contact between people, often through small droplets during coughing, sneezing and speaking.
While these droplets are produced during respiration, they usually leak onto the ground or other surfaces, but are not a long-distance infectious virus.
People can also catch the virus by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on various surfaces.
The virus is most contagious and contagious within three days of onset of symptoms, although it can also spread before symptoms appear or in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by a transcriptional polymerase chain reaction of the source via a nasopharyngeal swab/drop.
The use of masks is again recommended for people suspected of having the virus.
Recommendations for mask use vary among the public, with some officials recommending no use, some recommending use and some recommending use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment to treat the COVID-19 virus.
Local transmission has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or may not have cold-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and chills.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain and pressure, ganglia, difficulty waking up, redness of the face and lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these signs or symptoms are present.
Unusually, upper respiratory symptoms include a runny nose, runny nose, or neck pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, coughing and diarrhea/nausea have been observed in varying percentages.
Initially, only chest congestion and heart palpitations have been reported in some cases in China.
In some, the disease has spread to the lungs, leading to multiple organ inactivation and death.
This is called the incubation phase.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is normally six days but may vary between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms develop symptoms after 11.5 days of exposure to the virus.Reports indicate that not all people with symptoms develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic vectors is not yet known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with the virus who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and under investigation.The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 20% of all confirmed cases were hospitalized asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China also began recording asymptomatic cases on a daily basis from 1 April; 130 or 78% of 166 people tested for the virus on the same day were asymptomatic.
The virus was present at high levels in the lungs and in the lungs.
Talking louder than normal releases more droplets.
A study in Singapore found that an untreated cough can transport oral droplets up to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus is not transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioviral transmission may be possible and air collectors installed in hallways outside public rooms found samples that were positive for viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures, such as tubal ligation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, may cause aerosolisation of the respiratory tract and subsequent airborne transmission of the virus.
Although there are concerns that it is transmitted through feces, the level of confidence in the risk is low.The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; while it is likely to spread before symptoms appear, and the risk may be low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while it is clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can generally infect two to three people with the virus.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours or days.
In particular, the virus can survive on paper plates for up to one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and iron (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on 99% copper for up to four hours.
However, the survival of the virus on these surfaces depends on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents used correctly are very effective; the soap-related substances remove the virus's double protective coating, inactivate it, and also remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are also less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, a sample of goiter was taken on average two days after hospital admission.
In six of the five patients, the first sample showed a high level of virus transmission, and the sixth patient showed an elevated level of virus transmission on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients in Wuhan, China, belonging to the acute respiratory syndrome group.
All symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are inherent in the associated coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the use of soap in households, which breaks down the virus' protective coating.The SARS-CoV-2 virus is closely related to the original SARS-CoV variant.
The lungs are the body organs most affected by COVID-19, as the virus accesses host cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is highly concentrated in type II porous cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) and binds to the ACE2 enzyme and enters the cells associated with this enzyme.
Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is a common occurrence in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular disease symptoms is higher during disease progression due to vascular inflammatory response and disruption in the immune system, but heart muscle injury may be associated with ACE2 enzyme receptor/receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors/receptors arise in the heart and perform their function in the heart.
High rates of blood clots (31%) and intravenous clots (25%) were found in people with COVID-19 in the emergency room, possibly due to a lack of awareness of the disease.Exposure to COVID-19 in cadavers revealed severe changes in lung structure, and lymphocytic inflammation in the lungs.
Although the respiratory system of SARS-COV-2 virus has a defense system for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells, patients severely infected with COVID-19 have symptoms of high levels of systemic inflammation.
Specifically, the T-cells secreting the tumor-causing GM-CSF have been shown to be associated with the accumulation of inflammatory IL-6 secreting monocytes and severe lung injury or pathology in COVID-19-infected patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsies.
The World Health Organization published many screening protocols for the disease.
The rRT-PCR is a standard test method.
Typically, the test is performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal tube. However, nasal tube or sputum samples may also be used.
Test results are available between a few hours and two days.
Blood tests may be performed, but two blood samples are required, with the second sample taken two weeks after the first sample and the results of each sample taking much less time to obtain.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate and distribute genetic sequences with the coronavirus's form/origin, allowing laboratories around the world to independently perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect disease through the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which detect active disease and whether a person has already been infected with the disease) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The accuracy of Chinese experiments with experimental proof is only 60 to 70 percent.
The US FDA approved the first care test or examination on 21 March 2020 for use later this month.Diagnostic guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital recommended methods for diagnosing disease based on clinical signs and epidemiological risk.
Bi-directional glaucoma is common in emerging, heterogeneous and recent diseases.
Subpulmonary dominance and crazies (sliding of the athlete's curtains with variable filling of the pulmonary alveoli or orifices), and coagulation may occur as the disease progresses.
Limited data are available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The following are important findings of injury identification during autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary congestion and pulmonary oedema or fluid accumulation in the airways and tissues of the lungs.
Four types of viral pneumonia can be seen in severity:
Ordinary pneumonia: pulmonary oedema or fluid accumulation in the airways and tissues of the lungs, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large abnormal pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration along with interstitial/surgical inflammation and the formation of large polynuclear cells.
Severe pneumonia: Inflammatory discharge in the lungs, along with a disruption in lung structure (DAD).
Acute dysfunctional pulmonary disease (DAD) is caused by symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Recovering pneumonia: Inflammatory secretions and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis occurred in the pulmonary systole.
Blood: deep intravenous hemorrhage (DIC); locorithroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of contracting the virus include staying at home, avoiding crowded spaces, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the mouth, eyes, and nose with unclean hands.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering the mouth and nose with a paper towel when coughing or sneezing.
Follow proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing.
Also, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the use of face coverings in public places to reduce the rate of transmission of the virus from a symptomatic person.Social distancing strategies, including closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings, have reduced the contact levels of people with the virus with large numbers of people.
Distance guidelines also state that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8m) apart from each other.
There is apparently no effective treatment yet to prevent COVID-19 infection.Although a vaccine is not expected until 2021, a key part of preventing the COVID-19 virus is to try to slow the spread of the disease to a higher level, known as "curve leveling".
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that people wash their hands frequently for 20 seconds, especially after not using the toilet or when hands are dead/dirty, before eating food and after cleaning the nose, coughing and sneezing.
The Center also recommends the use of 60% alcohol hand sanitizer/anti-depressant, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization recommends two locally produced formulas.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial eggs in alcohol. It is "not an active agent for hand germ elimination".
Glycerol is added as a diluent.
People are managed with supportive care. This includes fluid therapy, oxygenation, and assistance with other vital organs/tissues affected.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people suspected of having the virus wear a simple mask.
Out-of-body oxygenation (ECMO) is used to address respiratory system dysfunction, but the benefits of this method are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to strengthen the immune system.
Supportive treatments are useful for those with normal symptoms in the early stages of the disease.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of people who are hospitalized for COVID-19.
The Institute of Brain and Lung Specialists in the United States has published treatment recommendations from various agencies as a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some healthcare professionals recommend acetaminophen over ibuprofen as a first use to relieve symptoms.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially when performing procedures in healthcare facilities, such as tube-inserting or hand-ventilating, that can produce airborne particles.
For healthcare workers caring for people infected with the COVID-19 virus, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that standard precautions, including contact precautions and aviation precautions, be taken to accommodate the ill person in an airborne virus isolation room (AIIR).The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment during the outbreak.
Recommended items and equipment include: personal protective medical clothing, respiratory or face masks, eyeglasses/eye protection, medical gloves/handbags. If possible, respiratory masks are preferred instead of face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
These masks are designed to protect against particles such as dust and dust in the air, but their effectiveness against a specific biological virus is not guaranteed, unless used as directed.
When masks are not available, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends the use of homemade face shields as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other equipment, but in some cases, it is necessary.
Forms of respiratory aid for deactivation of respiratory system dysfunction in COVID-19-related patients are actively being investigated in hospitals.Some evidence suggests that tube insertion should not be used during a breathing tube or bi-directional air-pressure machine (BiPAP).
Whether these two approaches will be equally beneficial for those who are critically ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to use mechanical ventilators by mouth because such a technique greatly restricts the airborne particulate matter than a breathing tube. Severe cases are more common in white people (over 60, and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for everyone, limiting the capacity of the health system to control the sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of patients admitted to ICU, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation and 1.4% died.
Almost 30% of COVID-19 patients in China are eventually admitted to ICU in hospitals.
Mechanical ventilators become more complicated as symptoms of acute respiratory illness in COVID-19 increase and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control mode and PEEP capability should increase oxygen supply levels, while also reducing the risks of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High-level PEEP may not be performed on older ventilators.
Studies on potential treatments began in January 2020 and a large number of antiviral drugs are being tested in clinics.
Remdesivir appears to be a promising treatment.
Although new drug development may continue through 2021, many trial drugs are already approved for further use or are already in advanced form.
Antiviral medications may be tested on severely ill individuals.
The World Health Organization is asking volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted provisional authorization for the administration of recovered patient plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the patient's life is critically and urgently at risk.
This experimental treatment has not been tested in clinical trials to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was created in China to help combat the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can use surveillance data to detect "close contacts" and potential risk of infection.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also notifies local health authorities.Large-scale data analysis on mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile monitoring and artificial intelligence are used to monitor sick people who have come into contact with people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government asked security agencies to monitor mobile data of people who may have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with people infected with the virus.
Also in March 2020, Dutch Telecom shared mobile location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, to investigate the virus and prevent its spread.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to identify and track quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Galera, said he was told by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are walking around".
The German government gave 48 hours off on weekends with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kirsty Kaljulaid called for precautionary measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience depression from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or from illness/virus.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are immediate hurricanes of damage to people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be normal with the presence or absence of some symptoms and the presence of other common neck diseases such as the common cold.
Normal episodes generally improve within two weeks, while recovery from acute and severe episodes may take three to six weeks.
Based on data on viruses like SARS and MERS, pregnant women are at higher risk due to the severity of COVID-19, but no relevant data are available on COVID-19.
In severely affected individuals, the COVID-19 virus can rapidly cause symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that result in respiratory failure, spread of the virus throughout the body and loss of function in many organs.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include spread of the virus throughout the body, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Blood clots, especially during prothrombin elevations, have been found in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while renal dysfunction has been observed in 4% of this group.
An increase in liver transaminase enzyme levels was seen in approximately 20-30% of people who were infected with COVID-19.
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days in the hospital.
In addition, people who were transferred to ICU rooms had an average time between hospitalization and death of seven days.
According to one case study, the average time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with the total time to onset of illness and death for patients ranging from six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China, the male mortality rate was 2.8%, while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of lung samples after death showed lesions of both lung tissues and a subsequent inflammatory secretion of cellular fibromyalgia in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations were observed in the nomocytes.
The lung image was similar to the symptoms of acute respiratory illness.
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, elevated troponin levels and cardiac arrest-related heart disease were neglected.
According to data from March in the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing symptoms.Access to medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may affect mortality.
Estimates of deaths from such conditions vary due to regional variations, but also methodological differences.
A low number of normal cases can lead to a higher than estimated mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths from past outbreaks mean that current estimates of the death toll are understated.
Non-smokers are 1.4 times more likely to be severely infected with the COVID-19 virus than smokers and nearly 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to and die in the ICU. Concerns have been raised about the long-term complications of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital officials noted a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in people who recovered from the disease and showed organ damage on lung scans.
This may be done after the patient leaves the ICU following a survival of the disease.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether pre-existing conditions induce effective and long-lasting immunity in people recovering from the disease.
There is a possibility of variation in immunity, depending on the behaviour of other coronavirus strains, but cases have been reported that have recovered from COVID-19 after testing positive for coronavirus.
The belief is that such incidents are caused by a continuing worsening of the disease rather than a new germ.
The virus is believed to be a natural virus and to have originated from animals through a wide range of microbes.
The exact origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the virus began to spread almost entirely from person to person.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, showed that the earliest date for the onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The earliest date of onset of symptoms in official WHO publications was 8 December 2019.
A number of measures are commonly used to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of examinations, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the onset of the disease, and demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization adopted the ICD-10 emergency disease codes. The U07.1 code refers to deaths that were confirmed in the laboratory with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the U07.2 code refers to deaths that were clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 virus without laboratory confirmation.The death-to-death ratio is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-death ratio is 6.9% as of 17 April 2020.
The numbers vary by region.Other measures include the case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who have died from a disease, and the virus mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from a disease.
These statistics are not time-based and follow specific people who have been infected through recovery from an incident.
While many people with disease do not produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about why so many people become infected with the virus.
A small village in the centre of the outbreak in Italy, Castellini di Base, with 4,600 inhabitants, had 80 (1.7%) deaths.
In Ganglet, the disease was spread by carnival festivals, and the younger population was spread with relatively low mortality rates and thus the death of all COVID-19 cases may not have been officially covered up.
In addition, the German healthcare system was still under pressure.
With the evaluation of blood donors, perhaps 3% of people in the Netherlands had antibodies.
69 confirmed cases (0.004% of the total population) have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and the mortality rate differ between women and men.
Studies in China and Italy show that the mortality rate is higher among men.
The risk age for men is 50 years, with the gap between men and women closing only at age 90.
The male mortality rate in China was 2.8% and the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and functional factors may account for it.
Gender-based immunological differences, which are less prevalent in women than in men and have more diseases in men than in women at the same time, such as hypertension in adolescence, can lead to an increased mortality.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the United States government did not monitor gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS virus infections affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at high risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease should be "COVID-19".
The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that the name CO stands for coronavirus, VI virus, D disease and 19 for the time when the disease was first identified and identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographic (such as China), animal, or group of people. The name was chosen in accordance with international recommendations aimed at preventing stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called symptomatic acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the World Health Organization has used "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 causing virus" in its generic descriptions.
Both the disease and the virus are collectively referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were both referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization's 2015 Guidelines on Nominations of Places on Diseases and Viruses, gave the virus and disease the provisional names 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory illness.
The official names, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers manufacture sanitary items and accessories such as cotton pads for cleaning the nose and respirators.
For example, when a hospital in Italy needed a respirator, and the supply company could not provide it on time, a newly operational company made 100 masks in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease were circulated and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans can transmit and spread viruses to some animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral symptoms in chickens, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is ongoing by government agencies, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "virtualization trial" to evaluate the pharmacological effects of four existing antiviral combinations in the hope of finding efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but many agencies are actively working on developing a vaccine.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccine development strategies are under investigation.
The first strategy is for researchers to develop a vaccine for the entire virus.
The purpose of using such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is to stimulate a rapid immune response of the human body to the novel COVID-19 virus.
The second strategy is to develop subvaccines aimed at developing a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system against subcomponents of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for developing vaccines).
Each of these strategies should be used to harness experimental vaccines for safety and effectiveness.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a hereditary harmless code from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent amplification has been proposed as a potential challenge to developing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this has generated much debate.
Since April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been conducted.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved treatments for malaria, four of which were conducted on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Many Chinese studies have involved the study of other disease drugs, with nine out of nine Phase III trials of remdesivir reported in most countries as of late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic clinical development study for COVID-19 vaccines and medications was underway.A number of available antiviral drugs are under evaluation and research for the treatment of COVID-19.These include remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/eritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir as well as interferon beta.
There is experimental evidence of the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical progress has been seen in the treatment of recovered patients with reduced use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was investigated in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, a joint review of the study is called for.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
In addition, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a dose of one gram per day, notes that taking the drug twice a day is too dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use request for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 infected patients at the request of physicians.The Chinese Seventh Edition guidelines also mention the use of interferon, ribavirin, or yomifenvir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high-level use of ribavirin is required to induce SARS-CoV-2 in laboratories.
Laboratory studies of nitasoxanide in test sites were recommended after low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 virus showed inhibition.Studies showed that high-level protein pumping is important for the insertion of SARS-CoV-2 through the interaction with the ACE2 receptor via transmembrane protease serine 2.
Research on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin has many limitations that have prevented the medical community from using them in therapeutics without further research.Ocellamyvir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in experimental studies and has no apparent role in the treatment of HIV-19.
Cytokine storms can complicate health conditions in the severe and late stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-inflammatory properties. The National Health Commission of China also included tuclizumab in its treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
After showing positive results in severe patients, a nationwide randomized trial phase 2 is being conducted in Italy.
This test, which is related to serum ferritin blood tests to detect cytokine storms, is intended to prevent developments that are thought to be fatal in some affected patients.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine symptoms caused by a separate cause based on previous case studies, CAR T cell, 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled trial evidence that tussilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of solid and solid antibodies produced from the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS without results.
Virus inhibition is a predictable mechanism of action whereby passive antibody therapy strengthens the immune system against SARS-CoV-2.
But other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy using monoclonal antibodies are also being developed.
Serum production of recovered patients, which involves extracting a portion of the fluid from recovered patients and using specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased to allow for rapid spread in the body.
Coronavirus disease, a group of related symptoms
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who became infected with the COVID-19 virus after raising awareness about the virus outbreak, died.
