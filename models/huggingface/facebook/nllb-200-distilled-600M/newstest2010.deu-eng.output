Barack Obama becomes the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here, becoming the fourth US president in history.
In addition, he will receive the diploma, the medal and a check of over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern Welsh metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The president and the wife are scheduled to meet with King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway.
The afternoon's visit culminates with the ceremony where Obama takes over the prestigious award.
He's the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to receive it directly from the office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan when he takes the prize.
The president doesn't want to avoid this issue because he knows he's taking the prize as a president who's currently at war in two countries.
He has stepped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan a few days ago, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Gold Medal, the diploma and the check for ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech kronor).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but he has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The programme of the event will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, in which the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reserved about the price from the beginning.
He indicated, for example, that he felt he did not quite deserve the prize.
He also repeatedly said that the price was not only for him but for all those who pursued the same values.
He said that he was "calling to action" immediately after the announcement.
Nature Conservancy accused of blackmail
The police in Leitmeritz accused the president of the citizens' association "Nature Conservation Community Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases, he appealed against some construction procedures last year, and for the withdrawal of his appeals, he demanded money from investors in his favour, said leadership police spokeswoman Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Nature Conservancy Leadership Association is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in jail and he's facing up to three years in prison.
The sorting containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort their beverage packaging, and in the southern cities, they can find sorting garbage containers.
What about Brno?
You'd have to reserve a few minutes to find the right garbage cans.
I do not want to say that the waste collection system in Brno would not work at all.
But I wonder if the Councilers are not taking care of this problem enough, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste race in the League of Primate Forests, not only because we as citizens here are allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastic in sorting containers, but above all because of the tonnes of waste for such waste.
Did they ever try to get downtown, like, the PET bottles in a collector's basket?
It's art, but it takes time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I've found so far is the slaughterhouse opposite the affected geese.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues should not be offended by us, but I think that is far too little.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honeycomb in other parts of the world.
I'd rather not have a whole bunch of my friends sort the garbage.
I was lazy.
Because they're too far from the garbage can.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself after the party to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored garbage in the distance on Konicova Street.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the tram.
The garbage almost ran out.
This is still the centre of Brno, representing the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to keep Brunei socialists cold.
They'd rather buy the city an ice hockey league that's embarrassing us all over the republic than buy a few more tons of garbage and offer the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brunette.
I'm glad I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after a while of searching the Internet.
According to the data of EKO-KOM, Brunei is indeed the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness payments
After the Left Party, despite the government's view, gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sickness and building savings.
But not for the interest on the government debt or for international litigation.
This will cause even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for wage increases for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for sensitive spending, retirement or health care. "This is just a delay in the future, mining", says Janota.
Loans are usually paid higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the state treasury is empty.
If social security benefits or costs for the public sector are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those who were given more money by the Left Party now: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
For the pensions or the sick pay, whose account has gone 1.8 billion, people need not be afraid they will get that money.
But at the cost of the government being more indebted, next year the state's treasury will not only be short of $163 billion, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and faster, and with it the costs and interest rates.
The government will need the money for the compensation, and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or cut maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
The budgetary deficit for some electorates will also mean a deficit of 5 billion for the development of motorways and railways next year.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which cannot be redesigned and possibly affordable.
At most, they get what's not free.
This means delaying or halting 30 large projects, and Europe's monetary creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed solving the cash flow by targeting the CEZ dividends, where the state owns the majority, and then distributing the money to the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion ECU went to the budget from CEZ.
The dividend is used annually to pay environmental damage and to replenish the pension account and also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
The EU rules also increase the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
But that's not the end of the carnival of reversals.
Almost three billion were cut in the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime or for legal disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can get by without that money is not certain.
It's a game of chance.
If we lose an international court case, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes clear.
The minister must then save the money internally or, at worst, attack the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already launched two billion dollar project "State Fund", which is intended to enable online monitoring of what individual authorities spend money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will be imposed, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems
The American people expect a mobile phone in the future that allows the user to switch between different operating systems with the push of a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
Just press a button, and Windows Mobile will switch to Android in a matter of seconds.
This is exactly the way VMware, an American company focused on developing virtual computer software, wants to introduce.
We're allowing you to run two user profiles on your phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and premiered a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test model to journalists using two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, running the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators to virtualize smartphones and the devices are expected to reach customers by 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains torments the hotel owners
The slopes are not just for the Giant Mountaineers.
The lack of snow also scares people away from ordering skiing in hotels and boarding houses.
That's why you can still get free rooms in the Giant Mountains for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set prices, but in the meantime, they're afraid to order compulsively.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be snow-bound or "match-bound", said Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year's Eve in the spider mill exactly as you imagine, you should stop hesitating to order.
If you prefer saving and the quality of your stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindel Mill hotel owners now offer mostly weekly New Year's Day stays.
I think they're going to be trying to sell them for a while, but then they're going to have to give up and go into the shorter term.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, Jandura estimated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we're most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
We still have about half of the seats available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last minute, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year's Day in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer places available here.
Good sales are also found in the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in wintering is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if it's snowing.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed in a week, they'll be sold out for Christmas, Schiefert says.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou are being occupied.
We're about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas, we only have a few rooms left.
There is a lot of interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and business will also be going well in February, the director of the best Pec Hotel, Karel Rada, informed.
The hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, at the newest hotel in Janske Lazne, half the beds remain free at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised by January of this year, for which we are now about 60 percent occupied.
The month of February is a little weaker, but when the snow comes, there will be an increase in interest in staying in the Giant Mountains, said Omnia Hotel's director Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a bigger snow shelter.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it rains, it should be snowing in the mountains.
But after that, warming is expected to return, said Jiri Jakubsky of the Czech Meteorological Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's almost strange how student-centeredly Barack Obama, the president with his reputation for being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally sweated his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he was copying it over the Bush-Iraq scenario paper for three years.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the January 2007 Bush Declaration as the name of his own declaration: "New Way Forward", without hesitation.
He himself criticized the Bush idea three years ago - to send fresh troop contingents to civil war-torn Iraq - as "irresponsible and disastrous".
But the months that followed showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful strategy, so much so that the news about Iraq is no longer being talked about at all.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, because he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting position than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked by the military to increase the troop contingent, especially by the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordination habits, was a fierce critic of the shooting guard at the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to turn the situation around.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't come up with a better idea, and so he cheated the general for the least of 10,000 soldiers.
He has pressed the European Commission for another 5,000, although he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic aspect of Obama's entire strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years.
Some doubt that the half-increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the recent war of brothers, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders respecting values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication that no one can be trusted and no agreements are being made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only a sham behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the ambiguity of the circumstances, which further complicates the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
The creation of a 'state capable of action', which is the minimalist aim of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
The timeline of Obama's strategy is alienated by his volunteerism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of explosion.
The belief that the little soldiers who broke into the war cry about the "early return" can do a miracle here can only be a truly romantic soul that doesn't let itself be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal is simply irresponsible because the Taliban will see this as an indirect acknowledgment of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is declining.
The European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their constituents how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukush mountain range.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not work, the United States will face a very serious question as to whether the problem can not be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period when America is moving after Obama to withdraw victoriously from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election, and so there is enough time left for him to turn to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
The managers of Goldman Sachs no longer receive cash bonuses
The executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this, responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers get shares instead of money, but they can't sell them for five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers if they are excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is thus leading efforts to link Wall Street's premium bonuses to long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I think Wall Street is aware of the direction it has to go, said former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has been the target of criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion in premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the most hot political issue in a number of countries since the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to tax the bonuses of bankers exceeding £25,000 with a one-off tax of 50 percent.
France is also preparing for similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
Five record-breaking women have taken over this year's Nobel Prizes in the field of literature and science from the hands of King Carl XVI of Sweden.
In addition to the four women scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for their work on the structure and function of the ribosome.
The last winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was awarded to the American woman Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of the economic report.
The only subject in which no woman won a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
This prize is awarded today to Charles Kao for his research on optical fibres and George Smith, along with Willard Boyl, for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the prize money.
The amount is 10 million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the cash prize is divided among them.
Traditionally, the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the American president, Barack Obama, this afternoon in Oslo.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in pursuit of his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to achieve world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.
President Vaclav Klaus is receiving the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the coming year in the form adopted by the House on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
Klaus is also criticizing the budget.
He said the budget deficit was too high, which further exacerbated the public finance crisis.
The meeting was informed by the President's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Mr Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about his continued function.
Under the budget law, which Klaus is now signing, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
But on Wednesday Parliament voted on the left-wing proposals to divert money and increase the money for public servants' salaries, social security and direct farmers' wages.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats to increase the budget deficit covertly.
The left-wing party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other, have thus created a sharp internal political dispute, which raises the question mark about the further work of the Fisheries Ministers' Cabinet, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed to form in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is effectively liquidating the austerity package implemented by the fisheries government in the autumn and that it is intended to end the national debt, as they understand it.
Klaus, who can but does not sign the state budget bill, said at breakfast with businessmen today that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" that is the "untenable deficit" of public finances.
He thinks there is no good solution today.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, said the budget is terrible and the government should consider its continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong statements".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, responded to Topolanek's words that the budget deficit was appalling, that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that it exceeds 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new Clint Eastwood film by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world much of the country's struggle and victories despite some criticism that the lead role was played by an American actor.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid system of government in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by American Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is being played by Matt Damon.
I said, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in the box office hit Eastwood drama "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the abolitionist movement that eventually became a slave owner, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became the country's president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time, it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film depicts a true incident in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are outside the world.
Finally, the South African team will rise to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the big screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The greatest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world's politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake hands with Mandela.
I noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it's transferred, and I felt like I knew what you were feeling, he said.
It's important to me to be a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, it opened, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, under the direction of director Eastwood, "Invictus: Unbeatable" has received positive reviews and there is also talk of Oscar prospects.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his review in the following words: "It was a very good story, a very well-done film".
In the film reviews on the web site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light secret over Norway solved: Russians tested a missile
A special lighting effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch was not successful again, however, and the "Bulava" missile, originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian general and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not taken into account the fact that the Commission had not yet taken into account the findings of the investigation.
Bulava is mostly not launched at all or damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers already describe Bulava as a "no-flying missile".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines
This is the 13th attempt, but it went normally at first.
It was not until the end of the flight that technical damage to the missile occurred.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage.
This time, the Bulava was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
So it's likely that the mysterious light caused by an unidentified flying object over the northern road was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The general public has refrained from doing so this time, saying that failure cannot be clearly spoken of.
The first two stages of the missile failed and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage were damaged.
Even if no test was successfully launched, only six out of 13 were considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence.
The almost 50% success rate therefore satisfies the general public with optimism and so it continues to be claimed that the Bulava will fly without problems and will carry up to ten hypersonic warheads with a total weight of up to 1,15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51.
Legendary defender Vyaceslav Fetisov is playing professional ice hockey again at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic and Stanley Cup champion is helping his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is likely to play in the KHL's Friday duel against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we need another defensive player.
Fetisov has been training regularly and has agreed to support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the AP Agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
It's unclear whether the return of the famous hockey player will be a one-game show.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the morale of other players, said Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he will be the oldest professional Russian ice hockey player, according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe, at age 51, played a full season for Hartford, earning 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and also won the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also accumulated success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup over his head in a Detroit-dress.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has surrendered to the unions.
The management of the Nosovice Hyundai auto plant agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union declared its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of Hyundai Motor Company, Petr Vanek.
The management is still trying to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We cannot abandon our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, volunteer overtime was proposed on the grounds that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The staff will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday 28 November shift.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of workers' rights.
In addition, all Saturday shift workers are paid for their fare and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of the unions that had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the workers of the car factory had been forced to work two more hours after the eight-hour shift practically every day.
The trade unions will withdraw their strike preparedness from the signing of the agreement.
Further negotiations between the car factory management and the trade unions are due to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchar said on Wednesday that if they could agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they would be ready to lift the strike.
The situation at the car factory was at its peak last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 workers went on strike spontaneously because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management argued that overtime work was required to meet the demand for automotive supplies.
The unions also demanded in their Monday strike call that no sanctions be imposed on workers who had stopped production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the unions are calling for a minimum of overtime work.
In addition, they are demanding that the payment of the payment of 5000 crowns be made this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The company started serial production in November last year.
By September, about 80,000 vehicles had been produced here, with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works even in 'stolen' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds designed to stop the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not work as strongly on common virus variants as one of the existing medicines.
AIDS is still a disease that cannot be cured.
However, the drug combination can prolong the patient's life and prevent the HIV virus from spreading in the body.
However, taking them is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of viral proliferation has led to the development of resistant viruses against which no medicines are effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemical and Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to tackle virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metallic carborans have an effect on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metallic carbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus's propagation in a different way than all the drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new 'improved' compounds, prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metal carbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-layered cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus splitting caused by HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would be created.
If we shut down the HIV protease, we also shut down the virus's propagation in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the CR Academy of Sciences.
In the paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically altered further.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effects of these substances on HIV protease were tested in the reagent glass, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallic carborans on the normal enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the medicinal products used in clinical trials, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, along with their other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical changes, make metallic carboranes interesting compounds for further research into the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the Structural Biology Lab at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
The budget dispute.
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for next year "horrible" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The statement of the SDGs was described by the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Commission.
The approach taken by the SDG and the Social Democrats to the public deficit problem is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with left-wing amendments totalling more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for social security benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats to increase the budget deficit covertly.
The Czech Republic should probably be running with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the House before the vote, and it has done so at the request of the Government, because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the budgetary provision.
Disappointment and Sins
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and sense of meaninglessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign from the case that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would have been different.
According to Czech TV, Janota has signed up for the Prime Minister's office on Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
In the same way, the Commission has also been able to make a number of proposals to the Council and the Council.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to pass deficit-increasing laws, such as those on sickness and pensions or the new service laws.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by the ODS were right
This is the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the USA.
It mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy positions who say they are TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to abandon the fight against the deficit height of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the left-wing majority currently in parliament".
Then he is not supposed to be able to count on the support and tolerance of the citizen democrats.
I have not thought about it and if it is relevant, I will deal with it", said Martin Bartak, the defence minister nominated by the citizens' democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council meeting this afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
Necas also stressed that the SDGs would likely vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the MPs of the CED to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not consider ourselves orphans, we are not small children, he said when asked whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
I have been in the process of trying to get the European Parliament to vote on the draft resolution.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
The Czech Republic will end or limit some less busy express and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by 2% from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, are not changed.
For example, the residents of the Ostrava area have several connections to the capital. The railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The high-speed train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
The Prague-Pisek-Budweis route is also served by fewer express trains, and the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are generally reduced.
The greatest reduction is planned for the Hradec Kralove district (Königsgraz), which will increase by eight percent.
Two night trains on the Prague-Tabor-Budweis route will also be lifted and the operation of some express trains on the Prague-Pisek-Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
The main changes include the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, which now requires the residents of Milovice to switch to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the 15th route of the Esko suburban transport system, which is opened by electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the Prague Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Yesenik will run in a two-hour timeframe.
The Pendolino will not allow passengers to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, and the railways will receive a total of 4 billion crowns next year to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss, as they did this year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
The railway has renewed a ten-year contract for local and high-speed trains, but so far it has only been for one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps because of this they have not taken action to raise prices for the vast majority of tickets.
Only one-day CD Net and low-cost eLiska Internet tickets are subject to change.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price will be increased from 450 to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the road, which has been uniform for travel between any county towns and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militiamen arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, in the southern Philippines, militiamen have kidnapped 75 people, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only about 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militiamen reportedly used the hostages as a live shield in their escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now working to release the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police were prosecuting the kidnappers for violence, demanding revenge between the two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre that killed 57 people led to the imposition of the statute of limitations.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre that coincided with the gubernatorial election were 30 journalists.
Suspected of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But on Tuesday, the peace talks with the Philippine government resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman, aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" will hit theaters in America, which includes a part of the life story of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was given to Morgan Freeman, who was supposedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar has been given to Matt Damon.
The film's cinematic debut also generated a lot of reaction from critics and the public.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals.
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sachar Prize, and in 1993 he and de Klerk received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
The film is expected to be released at a time when preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time the media is shaking the world with alarming news about the rise of racial hatred and the discrimination of the black majority.
According to the AP news agency, South Africa's response to the new film has been generally positive, despite numerous reservations about the casting of American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film, in his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for years and prepared myself well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person several times so that I could - as they say - receive his energy, he said in an interview after the film's Los Angeles premiere.
I think it's good that we can use this film to bring Mandela's personality and message to life.
It is a story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the rugby national team dress
The film is based on the book introduction by British author John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people, portraying the South African human rights defender during his first term as president.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial and interdependent populations over the course of the film, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also takes part in the South African national rugby union team's World Cup campaign, which South Africa won.
For entering the lawn in a dress that is considered a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela received a great ovation fourteen years ago, mostly from the white public, and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby World Cup may be able to bring people together again into one people, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only black member of the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve will be revealed.
But white South Africans are skeptical, as recently revealed in an interview with LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area , transformers are burning for several 10 million kroner .
The fire broke out in the morning at the Ceps company's transformer in the switch plant near the town of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman for the Usti nad Labem district fire department, Lukas Marvan, six units were involved in the fire.
Initially, the fire department wanted the transformers burned, but later changed its mind and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer short circuit.
No one was hurt, the crash endangered, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the pipeline system did not.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million kroner, more accurately the damage will be calculated only after the fire.
The transformator destroyed must be replaced by a new one, according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, nothing like this has happened at Ceps, she added.
According to Sona Holingerova, a spokeswoman for CEZ for Northern Bohemia, the electricity supply was not interrupted, and the fire at the power station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and businesses.
A.G. Ceps is the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV electricity transmission system in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switches with 67 transformers to transmit electrical energy in a distribution system and a 4339 km long pipeline.
Jancura is charged with defamation of three CSSD officials.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today charged with defamation of three social democratic leaders.
The contested parties are Michal Hasek from the district of South Mares, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the radio journal.
The complaint relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
All regions have signed longterm contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of the leaders attack us and say we're taking the raisins out, and we've only been presenting the offer to the extent that it's been voted on.
They say we're more expensive than the Czech railway because we know the prices of the Czech railway, which was completed last week.
So we have nothing left but to fight back.
Because of this libel against the Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all the districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
We are therefore preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be a continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as free advertising for his company and for his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do the same.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public and using false and untrue arguments in the matter of regional interest rail transport, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising that would point to the disadvantageous move of the districts.
He told the radio newspaper that he was going to stop the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He made it clear that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional rail transport with the Czech Railways and no tender for the 150 billion krone contract was opened.
In Vancura's view, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
The criticism of the train traffic in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, even a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't give up, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who he is, I won't say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Free and voluntary vaccination against pneumococcal disease
In January, the vaccine against pneumococcal disease will change habits.
She's the first to be free and volunteer for the families.
But now, voices are ringing that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new programme of action to combat the spread of the disease.
The Institute of Pharmacy already sets the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance companies must pay.
The experts are also familiar with the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for children in August
From January onwards, children born on or after 2 August last year can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they haven't received a vaccine dose yet.
Those who have started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further repeat vaccination themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year on the vaccine doses.
But they save on the treatment that would be needed by the children without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all the area vaccinations of children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumocokes cause middle ear inflammation, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause up to 28 children under the age of 10 to die in our country every year after being examined in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January onwards, these are to be paid for by the insurance companies and to be voluntary.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to take action to ensure that the measures taken are not compromised.
His association has been promoting the pneumococcal vaccine for a long time.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in at least doing that.
I think that's the way we need to go now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against pneumococcal disease.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
The president of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations. "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one", says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcal disease from next year.
The pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination to be paid for by health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, so they can save for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
But this is a concern of the practical pediatricians regarding the purchase of vaccines.
The original plan was to buy the vaccines through the insurance companies and then get them to the doctors in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some MEPs, however, feared that the insurance companies could "draw the money from health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
It is estimated that each practical doctor will have to spend 40,000 crowns a month, which is a significant sum.
It's not going to be easy, Cabrnochova says.
US artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania State Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailers.
They say Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used a drill to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
81-year-old Frank Frazetta Sr. is famous for his portrayal of characters like Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Jr. claimed that he was instructed by his father "to use all means necessary to enter the museum to put all the paintings in a warehouse".
The agency said Frank Frazetta Sr. denied giving any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary report against criticism from the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer was also accused of targeting low- and middle-income workers.
The main proposals are a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap on public payroll for 2011.
Social security burden
The unions, however, protested that low-wage workers are being punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of "problems" looming.
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has angered the private sector, which says it is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
Increase of social security by a further 0,5% from April 2011
This year's economic contraction is more than the expected 4.75%.
New 50% tax on bank bonuses
The Commission has rejected a 1% increase in corporate tax for small enterprises
Tax exemptions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in State pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be 90 pounds a year poorer and someone with £40,000 a year will be 190 pounds poorer, while someone with an annual income of £10,000 will be 110 pounds richer.
Ministers said their deficit reduction target by 2013 would mean "difficult decisions" but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the top 5% of earners.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission is not in a position to take any further steps to ensure that the measures are implemented in a manner that is compatible with the internal market.
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit relief and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour's predictions about future economic growth  affecting the extent of new debt and the rate of deficit relief  were called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75 per cent this year - far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April, while debt would be 3 billion pounds higher than previously forecast.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who are set to launch a new campaign on Thursday to warn Labour of the "debt crisis", said the planned 789 billion pounds of debt over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay the loan and were "cynic" about pushing hard decisions until after the election - which is due to take place in June 2010 at the latest.
"They said nothing significant about what they were going to do", said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do it, and they let it pass".
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists schools, hospitals and the police should be protected from future cuts, unlike the proposals of the Conservatives, who see deficit reduction coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money raised through tax increases and spending cuts will be used to cover next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argued that the plans were "built on sand".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements - like the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions in April next - it would expose the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the charge of voter fraud, as the money could be easily recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra aid when people need it most and that the situation be reviewed in September 2010.
"Holy budget"
Although ministers have not released budget details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only be lifted in the medium term.
The accredited Institute of Tax Investigation said the Treasury's figures would mean sharp cuts in many areas, possibly in the future, including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only moves the pain to later", said his manager, Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins", added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser at the business review firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-state report.
FBI is investigating "U.S. citizens arrested in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a home raid in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it's investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The State Department said they're also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are naturally very interested in the charges against them and the circumstances under which they are being detained", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are actually the missing students", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were being held in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had already taken an interest in the house and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but she said the United States must "work closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns "misconduct" in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as they have been for the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens were sentenced to prison, and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the start of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak penitentiary.
But since then, there has been no tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face a lot", he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
Five days later, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half-unconscious, Amnesty said.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he and 75 others had been held in a container at a prison in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response to it, but that Amnesty said the mandates and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope was set up in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a racetrack.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-meter slope.
The fourth-year medical student, John Hickman, said it was a beautiful view from the top of the hill, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the city lights shining underneath.
He added: "They are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent".
Prizes were awarded for the best artwork or tricks performed on the slope.
After the Thursday night event, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted against a ban on minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most explicitly secularized societies  and be integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and rigorous study of a contentious issue that divided and occupied the country for a decade and a half and whose impact is still felt today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the five to six million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic freedom".
He's a good listener, he's a good reviewer of debates between teachers and students about the issues that most concern them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-bearing banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up everyday life, as opposed to the political dramas that the media are engaged in.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom have a known name, possibly except for Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You don't have all the arguments on your side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Bowen interviewed are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts.  Proponents of purist Sunni Islam, which is linked to Saudi Arabia  show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims today.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a treaty requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn have had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognises a "strengthening of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you're inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most discouraging prospect in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks it melts at an alarming rate and takes with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have been moving into the recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear, in "On Thin Ice".
Traveled through the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in the hunt for polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea, fighting only with the rifle torch of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century showed 75 polar bears in one performance.
Even today, zoos typically still have one-millionth of the habitat of a wild old animal, and the climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore has become quite green from the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America, and Russia, slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sledding Inuit use powerful assault rifles to drive their prey.
Ironically, the waters north of these two hunting nations will have the longest ice age.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a gripping insight into what the future might hold.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
But it's not because of a lack of explanatory efforts.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first suggested the twisting of pack ice.
During the Cold War, submarines measured the rate of sinking.
A useful addition is satellite surveys and the large-scale deployment of probes on icebergs, but much is still accomplished by fearless people camping outdoors in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater reefs that are compressed during freezing.
But from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, everyone is at risk of being wiped out by the summer ice sometime between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... we could be us"
Marine infantry was among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington crown
Colonel De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women whose footsteps they followed.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be that, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company, a mourning wreath manufacturer in Harrington, Maine, established this tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington cemetery.
It's now an 18-year-old tradition, and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to hold events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas of the Pentagon, at the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the second time to purchase and transport the crown.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a retired professional soldier.
Although her husband isn't buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who sacrificed.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in warm clothes, the volunteers wandered across the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers were targeting older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War, as they are not visited as often as newer graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyful, children playing, and couples holding hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the icy air.
Some read the names engraved in stone, while others leaned down to small black and white maps of places that had been stuck in the wet mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears at her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Corps Infantry Officer David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'm gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him".
US government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold cell phones and notebooks in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
U.S. Consular Representative in Havana is trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not yet been released, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything on the charge of "condemnation".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protest and critical writing, risk arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers led by popular journalist Yoani Sánchez, who often describe how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but this has always been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro-brother communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy emphasizes that the United States will provide a counterbalance if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desirable products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, and it is mainly used for text messaging, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's wages.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, it's rare to arrest an American.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, the U.S. Interests Representative in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the handing out of free cell phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of Human Rights Watch, which recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, equal to Cuba", alluding to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the country's leader, replacing the sick elder brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused were very often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, especially at a time when both countries were moving toward greater dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an alleged leader of a conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits who are searching the Internet for radicalised young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an obscure insurgent known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after he tracked them down because one of them posted a consenting comment on terrorist attacks on the YouTube video website.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after arriving in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
They were therefore rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were not discouraged in any way and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - highlights the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence community has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets inside al Qaeda.
The recruitment of the organization acts as a gateway to those who do not allow those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who may be spies.
American aspiring recruits are being subjected to a special A-Kaida test, analysts said.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that in recent years, terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access to because US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, calling on the negotiators at the Bella Convention Center to take bold action on climate change.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists set small explosive devices on fire near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when the UN-sponsored climate talks were a little underway, thousands of activists walked through the city with banners that read "There is no Planet B" in English and one in Spanish that said "The Earth says enough".
Some celebrities joined the protest, such as Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's native Peru made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing because of the already tangible effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
Police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to an observer who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothes set off several explosive devices near the Copenhagen Main Canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light trains, but were followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently failed to reach the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international thinking, he replied in English: "That's something I wasn't even aware of".
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with negotiations or other people's freedom".
Test data show persistent racial gap
The math credentials were welcome good news for Washington D.C. public schools last week.
Although Washington County is still far behind the nation's top performing schools, the evidence shows that fourth- and eighth-graders have progressed faster in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures include is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders in Washington, D.C., rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) over the past two years, but only increased by three points from 209 to 212 for their African-American peers.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth graders remained essentially the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap between white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the scores that children in both groups achieved have increased over that time, the difference has hardly diminished at 58 points.
Some district education advocates expressed concern last week that the results, celebrated by school principal Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were being driven by the majority of white students who are already high-performing children.
This suggests that we've raised the overall rating by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult", said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for education equality in Washington, D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a two- or three-point range, said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city's high schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what I'm afraid of is that we're not spending the time and energy we should be spending on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the underperforming students.
For example, this autumn some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, which targets upper-middle-school and primary school students who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school careers and who significantly lag behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and life experiences from kindergarten through sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former Chief School Inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue working to make the best possible use of the measures available to students below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while still providing the additional money and resources for the low performing schools needed to bridge the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could have political implications that run counter to this important agenda item.
The weakness, of course, is that, like other urban school inspectors, it tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on making sure we build a great school system.
We need to strengthen our schools in the suburbs so that all families, wherever they live, can be sure that their children can get excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, D.C., to compete with charter schools.
You have to increase the school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year on 185 days a year, which he sees as a "milestone" on the way to a bigger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects
The bus will reach Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades, and the emerald-green grass.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and that of the other eighth graders in the group who explore Gettysburg, where the class costs $38,690 a year, was more like that of a reverent visitor than that of an enthusiastic prospective student.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" cried Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, when the Führer announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told about the school's low teacher-student ratio.
The Pennsylvania College was the seventh time the kids went on their three-day tour, and now they've fully grasped the message: The question isn't whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of Hispanic immigrant children born in the United States who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, and on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who are getting the college education needed to move up to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduates from college, which is a remarkable achievement, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they will pave the way for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study high-performing children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get into college, especially if these efforts continue for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, then a single step at some point won't solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children from preschool through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
It's known as GEAR UP -- Up the Grass -- and it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, with more than 60% of them going to college.
Iraqi oil ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild their damaged infrastructure through two auctions on Saturday.
The 10 contracts the Iraqi oil ministry has signed with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the recovery of Iraq's oil industry, which has been crippled by decades of war and economic sanctions.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that ever made a bid was the one that pulled the shortcuts.
Two American companies were able to sign contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly-seated representatives of the American oil company surprised analysts at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There won't be any more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and the political instability caused by the US military's withdrawal, have likely deterred American oil companies from engaging more heavily in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest proven oil reserves, analysts said.
US companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to enter into contracts with the Ministry.
Larger US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been on the side of technical advice in recent years, have been left empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on track to become one of the world's great economies and a technological power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its suppliers and will meet its obligations to Iraq.
The bidding process was conducted by the companies selected in advance, which were then compared to the per barrel oil fee the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
An apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week is said to have killed a top al Qaeda operational planner, US counterterrorism officials reported Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist official this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the northern province of Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal tribal belt.
They were driving a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence official from Miran Shah told the news by phone.
Local residents suspected of being members of the militants rushed to the scene and quickly took over what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials cited unconfirmed evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as a leading Al Qaeda military planner who led terrorist groups' operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous noted, pointing to the sensitive nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If its central role is taken for granted, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of al Qaeda and implemented them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second US official said Somalia had quickly risen up the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and had the best links to other extremist groups in the region.
The second official said that he may not be known to some Americans, but that does not diminish the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The rate of CIA drone attacks has dropped from an average of six operations a month to two since the summer, according to a summary in the Long War Journal, a nonprofit website.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their attackability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
UN envoy to Kabul to resign
The UN's chief envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term of office that has been tarnished by claims of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The oath of allegiance was taken when the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the US military withdrawal timetable, which is due to begin in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aiders to help Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but only fulfill an agreement made with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for two years.
He said he wanted the UN to be notified.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now to continue to lead so he has time to arrange for a replacement.
What I said is he'd better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun searching for a replacement.
UN officials say he was considering the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
His position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide denied all the allegations, but he also said that Galbraith's allegations - who was fired - "undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international election interference".
Oide said he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the assistance of US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the UN leadership allow its successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence that their money will be used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limited presence of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN settlement arrangements had undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is a disaster and it cannot continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because it has not participated in talks on its nuclear plans.
During a seven-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq, denying the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that I'm concerned about is if we've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, the war's own unpredictability".
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" was needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" under the sanctions.
In a statement issued Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the US government joined European leaders in warning that Iran must face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program fails to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that nuclear technology knowledge should only be acquired for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said it would resume talks to limit its nuclear program and waive a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have abandoned the provisional agreements negotiations since that time -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees about whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran has left the international community standing on a few proposals it had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "oppressive sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian delegation to the United Nations condemned what it called "baseless and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members on Thursday about Iran's nuclear activities, saying it was ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki this morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurdish and Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce US troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concerns about the impending withdrawal of troops. US officials quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will keep your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you".
A Change in the Rise of China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that taught them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave".
They learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started to change course this summer because of the low birth rate and the aging population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their immediate and definitive answer was, "No way".
We've already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, there's nothing left, Wang, 31, a staff manager with an eight-month-old son said.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which produced two generations of notoriously fat, sloppy single children, affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis is brewing in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared with 6 at the time this policy came into force, according to the UN.
The population survey found that the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to increase from 16.7 percent in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, like Shanghai.
Last year, nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents were 60 years and older, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Urban and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate the labor shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries like Japan and Sweden", she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy face huge fines - up to three times their annual salary in some regions - and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy the critical use of national natural resources that human rights defenders have condemned as abuses in enforcing the policy could be avoided.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to have an abortion.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, which resulted in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many tough slogans was eased.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at Peking University, said that government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children, with one partner being an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city has sent city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under their doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not particularly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing Reaction
Although officials from a rural small town outside Shanghai said there was a surge in applications from couples who want a second child after the campaign began, the urban districts are not reporting any change.
For example, in the municipality of Huinan, which has a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, chairman of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are likely the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
She said they want to give their first best.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and that this is also legal.
But like many Chinese, they have only a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yeah, they're robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
The problem is not simply politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the staff manager, said she only wanted a child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others, and we don't really want to".
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
He said that for middle-class parents with dual careers, where birth rates are falling, it's all about being successful and it's about being selfish.
The age group of today's 20 to 39 year olds grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don't want to live that way for themselves, he said.
He said that even a single child sets enormous demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "When the child is nine months old, you have to have a resume ready for the best preschool".
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group develops a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- re-emphasized Friday with the release of a document that sets out an ambitious 40 year greenhouse gas reduction, with the most burdens to be borne by the industrialized nations in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has both identified the remaining obstacles and shown the way forward.
But it was seen as a major step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, as over 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, drafted by a UN working group specifically for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can manage global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global temperature rise that policy makers would carry should be.
The process will be given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, chief executive of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to highlight what the UN's leading climate advocate, Yvo de Boer, called "the big picture".
It shows the blueprint for a possible agreement whereby the industrialized nations together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce their emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave a boost to the talks on Friday by ensuring that over the next three years it will provide $3.6 billion a year to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change - from managing floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that had shaped last week's conversations.
The US climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected proposals calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions reductions for industrialized countries compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies if they are not financed by industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration was taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by outside parties.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei made a statement saying that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or was "highly irresponsible" that he said earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China to cope with global warming.
The future economic direction of the world's major powers is at stake, and there have been breaches both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle is about saving individual economies as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States acting on their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even countries affected have moved to take more aggressive steps to hold those countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominance, says Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most affected by climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, submitted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island states' offensive "plays political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now united and demanding action from emerging countries like China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions must be resolved before the leaders arrive to reach agreement.
Senior officials such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister got off their planes and paused through the halls of the Bella Center for closed-door meetings and press conferences to counter claims being negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people coming in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists hosting night shows, making fun of the countries they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts being handed out by hand rather than email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the top, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first UK high-speed train at 225 km/h redefines the mood of Monday
Monday morning at 5:13 a.m., a whistle will be sounded through the dark to announce a new ride that will mark a revolution in Britain's transport.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will make its lightning journey from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras at 225 km/h and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin-Conditioner service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect the UK to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter towns, work travel times could be drastically reduced and the switch from aircraft and cars to trains would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still be putting the brakes on British high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will report to the Times on 30 December, Lord Adonis said.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will link London with the West Midlands, will run through urban areas and places where environmental impacts are controversial with a range of five metres.
In the open terrain, the plan will display the concept within 25 metres of the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger high-speed northbound rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route guide, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be divided into or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option", said a railroad insider.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first sub-line, which would not open before 2025, would allow travelers to travel from London to Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The plans allow trains to travel at speeds of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was designed to accommodate trains of 400 metres in length with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be operated on the London-Birmingham route.
This would mean that London would need a terminal station capable of handling 20,000 passengers an hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be built to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say only St. Pancras International or Euston have that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the railway network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed to existing railway lines north of Birmingham, keeping travel time between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is a crucial milestone in ensuring a change from aircraft to rail, a guiding step for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers are getting a mortgage for £75,000 of a conservative's orangery
Alan Duncan, the Conservative's leading member of the House of Commons, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange house he's building in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that House members had to live on "meat rations", has raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak tree plantation at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons approved the petitions at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is reviewing the expenditure of the House of Commons.
Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (€1.1 million).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining, but the Fees Office, a spending control unit in the basement, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he planted a winter garden called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased cash-flow during a recent review of his previous mortgage contracts by the Standards and Privileges Committee.
The Committee found him not guilty of breach of the rules last month after examining his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over £271,406 from his London home to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before he was elected to Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan was being reimbursed by March last year for about £1,400 a month as mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Duncan's RBS mortgage remained unchanged during this period, suggesting that the entire increase was used to finance the withdrawal of £75,000 (EUR 85,000).
The normal non-degree RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The most recent documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to assert his claim to £1,250 (€1,400) a month this May.
Duncan lost his position as Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him after the spending scandal that parliamentarians would live on "meat rations".
"Basically, when you work for the state, it means you have to live on meager rations and be treated like shit".
He said: I have spent my money on my garden, and I am entitled to a small portion, according to what is due.
And I could have demanded the whole damn amount, but I don't".
The MP, a millionaire from his earlier career as an oil giant, was first attacked in May for his spending when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had cleared with the Fees Office that this could be "considered an exaggerated demand".
An activist dug a hole in Duncan's lawn as a protest after it became known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was approved by both the Fees Office and Legg for the subsequent increase".
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and sneaking or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves within the strict rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer".
Come all your faithful to admire Brighton's beachside cabin advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new way of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discovery through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols for each December.
The event began on December 1 and visitors were able to view the newest hut every day from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. with free sparkling wine and traditional mince pies, with cakes filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas songs chosen so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", with the hat decoration here being the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and have exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach cottage advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place, and we try to express it through our spirituality".
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate change.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on fighting global warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, and 100,000 according to organisers, marched in the chill of the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which is due to conclude by Friday, and which could enter into force in 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairman of the Climate Conference, the increasing global climate mobilization is contributing to what these demonstrations show is that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, smashed windows with plywood stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-riot police immediately and without regard intervened.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people, who you estimate are mainly members of the Black Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made their name at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were detained "without distinction", stressing that about a hundred of them were "still being detained on Saturday evenings in the streets", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and seated positions.
The more peaceful train went from Parliament to the Bella Centre, where the negotiations were held.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the speakers to a candlelight evening attended by the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters travelled by bus and train from the major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you wearing sky blue raincoats, made their first morning outing in Copenhagen as they followed the call of Friends of the Earth to create "blue waves" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand redress for the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist for the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say to ourselves, 'We have time,' said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that run dry, waterways where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalist critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, a leading globalist, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate change and the fight for a different world".
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to warming, has given the start to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who were marching in red and hoisting bandanas in which you praised solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators marched to demand a vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the 350 network gathered several hundred people, in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
A group of people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia has denounced that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi declared the "strike".
Some 131,000 people were called upon to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian War for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
The turnout was about 58% a few hours before the closure of the polling station, according to the Abkhaz election commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates, including former President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
The Georgian President, Mikhail Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under a Russian occupation, his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the autonomy of this area of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a new stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr. Bagapch, has explained.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital city of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are everywhere in this small area of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the east of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, prepared a warm welcome for the Russian delegates who came to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, in a nod to Moscow's support, particularly regarding the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year as one in which Russia leaves control of the railway in Abkhazia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round of voting must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: world-wide demonstrations, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, ready to go, arrested about 700 people on the sidelines of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the chilly afternoon in the Danish capital, which is hosting delegates from 193 countries by 18 December, seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Centre, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to enter.
A stage was built to welcome the speakers to a candlelight evening attended by former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the train passed, a group of protesters dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers began hitting discs, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-riot cops immediately surrounded you and unresponsibly intervened by throwing some of you to the ground.
Police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made clear that they are mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Around midnight, during the incidents in which police said about twenty people were arrested for the time being, a policeman suffered a bruise on his chin from a plastic stone.
"We have the extremist groups under control", police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen explained as the police helicopters circled the air.
Most of the protesters arriving by train or by their own vehicle from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
But there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen this morning after the call of the Friends of the Earth to be one of the first groups to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the environmental debt be paid back to the people of the South", said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say to ourselves: we still have time", says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that flow, there are waterways that you can walk through, which was never the case before".
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched with the adoption of the UN Convention in 1992, the movement against globalisation has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP and globalist José Bové told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice". "There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized several figures, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, to appeal to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, which has many islands particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, advertised solar power in front of the municipal administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of protesters have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta for a protest against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organised by the Network of 350, particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history are, according to Chatel, strengthened by the reform of the Lyceum.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated that the subjects of geography and history emerged strongly from the reform of the Lycees, even though they are not taught in the secondary school (Year 12).
"The students of the Première (11th year) now have the same programme every four weeks", Mr Chatel confirms.
The Minister believes that "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration of "the best students".
"The economic, social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific profile", he continued, stressing: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical and geographical education in the technical lyceums".
A survey by IFOP published in Humanité on Saturday found that almost seven out of ten French people (69%) criticized the government's plan to abolish compulsory history and geography education in Terminal S (school year 12 with a scientific profile).
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the S-Terminal programme.
Luc Chatel also defended teacher education reform, as 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a protest on Tuesday against the project, which she believes is targeting the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that they take a qualification test at the beginning of the year in Master 2 (M2) and an entrance test at the end of the year to test their teaching skills.
They also conduct internships during the year at M2 and then teach one year before the students as an apprenticeship teacher.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the exam, you will get even more hours than you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours".
The minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in education".
He confirmed again that he wanted to cancel the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the Ecole Normale Supérieure
Fifteen minutes to talk about the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, faced at the Ecole Normale Supérieure on Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday morning.
As one AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts address the public for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
"We want to do something that reaches people and makes them want to learn more", said Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the event, on the sidelines of the conference.
"The twenty participants were selected from among the experts, even according to their charisma", he explains.
"Climate warming can be talked about for hours, but the nuclear targets can also be set in minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke freely in front of about 50 people using only foil.
"This is part of our role as scientists", he stressed, hoping that the audience would learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier".
The videos from these conferences will be available online on the school website from 15 December.
The next "nest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment: angry prison guards, planned actions
The prisoners' unions called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budgetary reasons were transferred to January before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Prisoners (FO-Pénitentiaire) called on non-working staff to demonstrate and block them in front of the prison on Tuesday morning to raise awareness of the "theft of what is due to them".
The Third Union of Prisoners (CGT-Pénitentiaire) called for "strong mobilisation in the various prisons" to market the non-payment of overtime, nighttime and holiday allowances in December as "disgraceful and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Prisons Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations . . . to show dissatisfaction and anger".
The head of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and that not all of it was budgeted, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the prisoners' unions guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and to modernise it", the Minister of Justice said in her letter.
'I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate action to prevent a situation such as this, which has been caused by a lack of assessment of overtime, from recurring in the future,' added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December salary is therefore low, except for the management staff who enjoy high service and target premiums, UFAP/UNSA explains, for whom the "budgetary constraints" must be met.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional union FO in Marseille is angry and announces a boycott of "all assemblies and summits" until new instructions are issued.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours from October to December are still unpaid.
"At a time when we are increasingly being given more work without more staff, the attempt to enrich ourselves with staff funds is more than inappropriate", says the Bordeaux CGT union.
The trade unions say that the situation is not the same in all regions, some less affected than others.
In any event, however, it is unfair, says the Secretary-General of UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama thinks he's always giving out better presents at Christmas than he gets.
The US president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has been cheering on the TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving out better gifts than he gets.
In a special broadcast on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new, picturesque home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged family companion, will be with us from the party.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too", Michelle Obama affirms, adding that the dog will naturally also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you beautiful gifts last year", she tells the president.
"Please", he cried out, pointing to the First Lady's pearl chain. "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour, casual broadcast with the well-known television hostess who so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about the gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a 10-car bike and a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember my father visiting us one Christmas and bringing me a basketball", the president said.
"It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized I had this ball from him".
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange furniture in a house at all, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the fireplace.
Johnny Hallyday is back in surgery, RTL confirms he's been put into an artificial coma.
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles for significant "damages" after an operation in France, according to people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician underwent surgery again Wednesday through Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "damage from surgery on a disc" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his Paris production company, which added that these injuries required another surgery.
The singer's production company, however, wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and said a new medical opinion would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the singer's partner during his last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
But it was not until 48 hours later that a little more certainty was given about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources indicate" that after its first operation in Paris "no drainage" was carried out.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a disc incident.
The procedure, which was scheduled to last several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician who had treated many stars.
This was not available for comment to RTL on Thursday night.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was walking through a "deep valley", but he assured that "no worries" about the rock musician, as he is "a good fighter".
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was stupid to get on a plane for 12 hours after an operation like this, and it's not going to work", said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained".
Mr Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, concerns about the singer's health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had a "small bowel cancer operation" that resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively discussed, and fans and journalists have not missed the fact that the singer struggled to move on stage.
It wasn't until mid-November that the people around him had to refuse another admission to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Short track: first place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédéric Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at Euro 2009 on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of the competition, the last time polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was set by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m men's.
Shame on Bousquet, who wanted to break the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he holds in the big pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal distances in swimming, the 50-meter freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed a 20.53 seconds in a final with ten swimmers in the start (usually eight) - an international premiere.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things, and in this case, I said, if the world record is within my reach, I'll try".
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which first began in 1999 at the same competition.
The combination was used this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world pool champion this summer in Rome and world record holder, but it didn't pay off.
The young swimmer failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77) but still managed to break his career bests (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give it all this time.
I knew I couldn't set a world record today, but I defended my title and I did my job".
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future", Biedermann explained.
USA: Zola grave record estimated at US$ 1.5 million
A Roman tombstone found in the hands of French writer Emile Zola was valued at $1.5 million on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This tablet is two meters long and 63 centimeters high, and it dates back to the third century AD, and it was always valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, which "shows four scenes of Dionysus in a sophisticated architectural decoration surrounded by satires and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world", Florent Heintz, Sotheby's vice president of auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiquities, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what buyers have been most bidding for so far", Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was kept in the famous Borghese family's home in Rome for almost 300 years, after which it was discovered piece by piece by the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and by Paul Reynaud, minister in the Third French Republic and president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plaque was part of an "inheritance of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has failed.
On Thursday, Mexico declared the terms for the transfer of the ousted Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to his homeland no longer acceptable after the coup government rejected the move as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place overnight, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the way this transfer could be carried out, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
According to the Immigration Agency, the plane, which was boarded by the Mexican government and arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring Mr Zelayas, has returned to its place of origin.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "give up" and ask for political asylum abroad.
The deposed president, however, refused to do so, wishing to return to Mexico as the most welcomed acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure in trying to get me to give up at my own expense (...), they wanted me to resign", Mr Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, where he frequently speaks on the political crisis that has been raging in the Central American country for five months.
I can and would like to stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the attack of some chords.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept because it does not include an asylum request, Oscar Raul Matute, the interior minister of the coup government, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur channel.
He stressed that a possible departure from Honduras would be undertaken only as President of the Honduran people.
The rumors of Mr Zelayas's departure on Wednesday mobilized the supporters of the deposed president, who had gathered around the Brazilian embassy, and the military there had stepped up its efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
This, he said, reflects the marginal nature of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day of the referendum he organized to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He had returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21st, and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for high treason, which he will be accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup d'état president Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the draft budget.
Three days later, the Congress had massively voted against Mr Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street is booming, the U.S. trade balance is growing optimistic
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, with US trade balance figures showing a price recovery in U.S. stocks and their partners: the Dow Jones surged 0.67%, Nasdaq 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to the closing figures, has risen from 68.78 to 10.405.83 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has risen from 7.13 to 2.190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 was rated at 1.102.35 points with 0.58% (6.40 points).
There is good news from various sectors of the economy, judged Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal on the premise that the market is only focused on 'half-filled glasses', she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on US trade balance figures, which "exhibit an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion compared with September.
The analysts, on the contrary, had expected deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in total trade volume, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have risen in the past week against all expectations, reaching 474,000.
However, the average number of new jobseekers has fallen to "the year low" over the past four weeks, said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on 10-year government bonds increased to 3,482% from 3,432% on Tuesday evening, and the yield on 30-year bonds to 4,492% from 4,408% the previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle "Ladies in White"
Several hundred Cuban-led partisans on Thursday flogged the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and foiled another rally that resulted in the temporary arrest of a good dozen dissidents.
The forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were spat out in the open by partisans of the Raul Castro government as they marched into the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankees! "Mercenaries!" "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!" "Fidel and Raul live!" the empowered partisans shouted with their fists up against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilians who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" took place in Havana the night before, with no casualties or arrests.
In the Vedado district of the port, a dozen dissidents who also marched on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day demonstration were temporarily detained by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police force forced dissidents trained by government partisans to board civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the 2005 Sakharov Prize, the Ladies in White organized an unauthorized march to "appel for the release of all political prisoners", which according to the dissident list number around 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the regime's opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstrations between militant pro-government fighters and "counterrevolutionaries" that took place on Thursday.
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, particularly freedom of expression.
Madman kills eighty-year-olds with a knife and leaves five injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others late Friday afternoon during the main business hours in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to initial information from the interview, the 28-year-old assailant had wounded the 80-year-old with two knives in the presence of witnesses, for an unknown reason, in or outside a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures.
The old man, born in 1929, is reportedly suffering the consequences of his injuries at the hospital, according to a police union official.
He's been in or out of the same pharmacy forcing a couple of couples with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in his three-legged suit, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims were taken to hospital with serious injuries, where the 80-year-old died.
The other victim is in danger of death, as police sources say vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman became ill as a result of the events and was reportedly hospitalized in a "state of shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped to the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had injured two other passersby, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of whom was seriously injured.
The scenario remained dark that evening.
He was armed with two meat knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a union official in the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passersby, including teenagers, reportedly tried to arrest the lunatic, according to witness reports obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in the triplets with a green vest.
Three teenagers tried to step in.
They couldn't because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde fell on him, he added, including a city cop who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the gunman and were wounded with knife stings, police said.
The event took place in one of the main shopping areas of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in a first aid position and noticed a stiff wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, to AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, came in, injured by cut wounds.
State police finally arrested the man who was not carrying any ID.
The public prosecutor's office of Nanterre has commissioned the district police office of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
Given his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't rule out his being committed to a neurosurgery facility.
According to another police source, six policemen were arrested to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been transported.
He was "in a state of excess" as "all the mental confusion of the kind in which the forces are released during the meeting".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for the prosecution to be suspended
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski repeatedly called on the Los Angeles (California) court on Thursday to drop the criminal charges against his client, who is currently on trial in his home country of Switzerland for a morally incorrect act committed more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, counsel for the director of The Pianist, denounced gross misconduct in the 1977 trial before three judges of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in California.
I am calling for immediate relief, Mr Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the hearing, "made it go cold in the back".
According to him, the late judge, Rittenband, before he was sentenced, had discussed with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison -- which was a serious miscarriage of justice.
This discussion was raised in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", specifically by the defendant, David Wells.
Mr Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the documentary's authors had " lied " to him.
If the Court refuses to stay the proceedings, Mr Hummel will be required to conduct a trial which would enable him to present the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already presented at first instance, namely that a discussion on the abolition of the charges against the defendant cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978 before the sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old minor.
He hasn't traveled to the United States since.
Los Angeles County deputy attorney Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the hearing".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?
In her opinion, "the filmmaker is asking the court for a favor and thus despising its authority".
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to announce their decision even stressed that "there are other escape options".
Hummel wasn't the only one who had asked for the prosecution to stop Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also once again demanded the criminal proceedings be stayed.
She recalled that her client would no longer be harassed by any revival of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the grounds of an American warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street is being held back by the rise of the dollar and closes without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a price, with the Dow Jones gaining 0.63%, while the Nasdaq losing 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq has yielded 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet", said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tightly limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think it will remain so until the end of the year".
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market outlook on the solidity of economic recovery", Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and much more than expected.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared with 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan Index Forecast.
However, indexes were slowed by a further rise in the dollar, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, 'pushing down sectors vulnerable to the economic situation,' explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond increased by 3,540% on Wednesday evening from 3,482% and the yield on the 30-year bond increased to 4,497% from 4,492% the previous day.
Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World contestants will cross the last hurdle to fulfill their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world by a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is being held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already secured their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned Miss Sports or Miss Topmodel during their stay in Africa.
This was a real whirlwind of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and experienced many things!" said Miss Sierra Leone enthusiastically.
The competition, which is the ninth time the event has been held in South Africa, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, starting at 5pm Central European Time.
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, stressed Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "stunning landscapes".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focused on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will be present in this election, and Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organisers, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates defile in traditional dress and not to forget, in swimsuit.
The show is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former beauty queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a Miss World committee official, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hardly exaggerated, assures Miss World President Julia Morley.
The candidates, like last year, took a safari to visit the famous township of Soweto, but this time on their bicycle and local cuisine.
But the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma was quite exceptional, and he gave them the hand.
Not unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
However, her best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (South West) for the 2010 World Cup in June, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I'm messing with people I probably never could get close to otherwise.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to visit his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane, arriving shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 a.m. local time) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "go as quickly as possible" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial infection following surgery on a disc failure on November 26.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and to continue his treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to a bacterial infection on Monday following a band-disc surgery in Paris on November 26.
The singer had to undergo another operation on Wednesday night due to the illness caused by the last surgery.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French High School in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade is going to school, an AFP photographer noted.
Yves Catoné, head of the department of orthopedic and trauma surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer has put a heavy strain on neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told he had committed the most brutal massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus explained.
I heard that a court case might be launched, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally spoke to this doctor on the phone, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me, since I myself had already had two CD surgeries behind me, he added.
He had previously told RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, operated a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has been convicted several times for failing operations and, not to mention, for tax evasion and fraud.
Mr Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Medical Board, described him as "a man without scruples" who has to answer to the board "regularly" and is "anything other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said the intervention had "perfectly gone" and the post-operative examinations had been "normal".
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore did not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been on the rise since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that there is a bit too little to do on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) is taking a strong stand and is calling on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The alliance, which is overseen by François Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted violently on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, which was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the president of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him, under threat of prosecution, to stop using the seal on any document.
Hervé Morin announces his intention to take over the UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy before the National Council of the NC on Saturday.
In recognition of his efforts, he had the support of the Member of Parliament Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who is claiming ownership of the UDF trademark, having first applied for the trademark in 2004 at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle.
However, the office of the UDF, a party alliance supervised by François Bayrous' friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they were not going to be expropriated and gave the Minister and the Member a deadline to stop using this seal and to transfer the ownership rights to the trademark to them under threat of prosecution.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal, the Alliance of Parties wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centre Alliance.
You may also have thought that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, on its political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF Office explained, and urges the NC Party to 'immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (its) website'.
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required to 'transfer the proprietary rights of the mark to its legal right holders'.
If you refuse, we will sue you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that the UDF has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "choose" to leave in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the party "UMP".
The new centre party therefore has no rights to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy) seal, according to the signatories.
They recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 approved the three-year accession to the MoDem party and the establishment of a bureau to defend the 'material and moral interests' of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the Office continues, 'he was no longer a member of the UDF but of the UMP for three years at the time he applied for the trade name.'
He is profiting scandalously and fraudulently from the lack of the UDF acronym to do this for himself.
Furthermore, it is important to remember that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and it is ironic with the NC strategy: 'We seem more dignified in politics and in life to make a name for ourselves rather than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently claiming a name to which we have no legal right.'
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploiting weakness
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, used an 80-year-old's weak moment to gain some of her wealth.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will face a trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are folded and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to submit a report before 10 March 2010 to clearly state whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these tests.
I will speak to her, Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Ms. Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the Court's decision.
This is excellent news (...).The opinion will prove that he (Banner) manipulated this old lady who must be protected, he confirmed.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother's weakness for years to obtain gifts totaling one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer she considers her longtime friend.
Although the court would have to consider the admissibility of the lawsuit brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidoyers of the lawyers on Friday led to a large family banquet.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer relied on three letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary by her client, in which she wrote that she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years, I wrote to Banier once or twice a day.
I haven't been able to talk to Françoise since she got married".
The Nanterre public prosecutor's office reiterates its view that the applicant had no right to react in this way, in particular because a custody judge in the last few days rejected her application to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt 'is fully qualified, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act on their behalf", said Prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the admissibility proceedings against Mme Bettencourt-Meyers have taken place.
The manager revolution or the end of strategic early detection?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees has said the attitude of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for staff to join "values" determining the best as it used to be on consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering local markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose separate factors products on customers' preferences again regularly!
The demobilisation of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the culmination of a much larger phenomenon, which affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&E and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Economic Intelligence) calls on all parties involved to 'take a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach'; it demands that employees engage in activities that are totally contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for an operational revolution, which would involve putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns alongside customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its employees, stimulate this revolution in management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First, because I could see that the whole fabric of a new situation, after many lapses, eventually comes down to doing the first thing it always has done.
It is also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - is increasing in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a very simplified idea of human behavior.
Taken from the great engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They take up the old behavioural theory, which has recently been reactivated by the American "neuroscience" and unknowingly spread widely by research institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to leverage employee engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces the attitude of managers towards a mechanistic control system unsuitable for the world today.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, the operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into every management consideration or practice: for the recipients, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only studies from the multifunctional analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
The identification and measurement of these mobilization factors enables business leaders to control, predict and anticipate their 'social performance' and to put their human resource management back in the right place.
They create a fertile soil that is conducive to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American Right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the night before and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked Obama's award on October 9, applauded the president's speech this time, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the right wing face of the Republican Party, told USA Today, adding that she herself had brought up the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her own published memoirs.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
She says we need to stop the terrorists down there.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of force in Oslo on Thursday, a way to declare his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really good, cheered the former Speaker of the House, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some respects, I felt that this speech was historic", explained Ginrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is considered by some to be a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, said he was pleased to see a "leftist president" reminding members of the Nobel committee that they "cannot be free and can not award a peace prize if the use of force does not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer for George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan", as "he always does", he spoke "like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live in a bubble of security they did not create themselves and do not do much to protect", Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush era falcon, called the speech on the National Review Online website "boring, highly provocative and uninspiring".
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama is defending the military.
If you cover the war with the cover of justice, the massacre of the innocent can be justified, he warns.
The moderate left press, however, continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes Obama was awarded the Nobel Prize prematurely, called the speech itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "provides a roadmap for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California daily enthusiastically said.
The New York Times believes Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Three marathons for a deal to secure Christmas supplies
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the trade unions of the Road Federation and the TLF - the only employer organisation to stay until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening to end the strike order and the looming severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, which was opened on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators split up early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
This was despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting on a hunger strike.
However, it took more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was not signed until 18:00.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wage earners (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage earners (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"It's not much, but we're starting small", says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now being told to stop blocking the health centres.
"However, there will probably always be some rebels who are not satisfied with the agreement", he adds.
TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of a 'good agreement' although it was 'difficult to accept these wage increases in the face of international competition'.
According to him, the increase is EUR 170 per month for the lowest wage groups and EUR 100 to 120 for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for workers", said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on this point on 'an acceptable compromise'.
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and a maintenance of the overall road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will allow for the discussion of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of tariff agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that 'the reduction of employer taxes of EUR 100 million' was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 draft amended finance bill, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday night.
The government is demanding "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the enterprises affiliated to that organisation and then to the whole profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "within a short time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The FNTR Association accused the trade of being 'fraudulent' because the €100 million had already been promised to the sector to offset a part of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport compelled us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to displace the goose-eaters on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complained.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens to "scramble a grave for small and mediumsized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line A: Disruption this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
Disruptions on the RER A line, France's largest high-speed rail network for the Paris metropolitan area and the Île-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike, between the unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Transport Authority) kept strikers waiting with their demands for pay increases.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, no trains ran between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for service and outside the central line only one of four trains was ready for service.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing the passengers to switch.
The Galeries Lafayette chain, which has 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is working to connect the big stores with traffic".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP route connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran as planned during rush hour, and almost none during rush hour.
As on Thursday, there was no mob on the train tracks, as the people of Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), engineer Jack Nbakina (29) said he had "got up an hour and a half early to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to the passengers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that no traffic jams had occurred at Saint-Lazare.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line to and from Cergy-le-Haut came to and from Saint-Lazare station to provide connections to the subway.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strikers held again their main meetings, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as 'poor' after meeting with the top leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Director-General proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, such as working hours, occupational trajectories, etc.
However, this is not what drivers want, and according to Thierry Garon (South), they are demanding a long-term pay rise.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself was putting its own wage-increase proposals in check and stressed that the leadership was 'incapable of solving a problem, while it was possible for the long distance drivers and the SNCF to do so.'
The RATP made it clear that a second meeting for a "comprehensive review of working conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company 'ignores weekend drivers'.
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the Paris branch of a committee.
Once again, the leadership rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting to calm the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line following a pre-announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The unions are demanding a wage surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and they are also complaining about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which is used by millions of travellers every day.
RER drivers with years of experience receive a gross salary of EUR 2 200 to EUR 2 700 and a pay supplement of EUR 600 to EUR 650 for shiftwork and Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that promptly followed angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the country's southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to greatly hinder the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to end the 25 years of conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç to the press four days after the decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, requiring a majority of seven votes to declare the dissolution.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders expressed their views before the ruling that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than act like non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a 2007 trial by Turkish Federal Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and numerous other countries consider a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party insists it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The Constitutional Court's ruling is in the meantime the government's aim to confront the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to defeat the Kurdish support for the PKK and put an end to the conflicts.
DTP leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in the southeastern Kurdish-populated million-million-square-foot city of Diyarbakir.
Law enforcement officers used tear gas grenades and water cannons when protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Turk assumed that the court's decision would "deepen the despair even further".
"Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning a party", he told the press.
The government, which is made up of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This will not solve the problems", said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of democratic openness that has been promoted by the government", said political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"Obviously, one can be prepared for a PKK reaction", he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK admitted to an attack three days earlier that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey, one of the most brutal in recent months.
The snowfall may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
It's so his people can try out all the vehicle technology and learn to master it.
By the weekend, it could be this close for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are on standby to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following a precise plan.
Once it snows in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero, 20 so-called A-lines are driven by large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include major transport and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire departments, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and crevice routes, like Atzelberg Road.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
The approximately 1,400 miles would need to be sprayed with moisture-soluble salt in a maximum of three hours if necessary.
The FES therefore starts at 3 p.m. "so that the roads are clear until professional traffic starts".
It's gonna be hard when it doesn't snow till 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because nobody is willing to make room for the scatters".
Only afterwards, if it does not snow, are the roads of supply and development, including the Rats-Beil-Straße, to be taken.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Braburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's footmen are on their way, and danger points and crossings are evacuated.
The FES cannot usually take care of all the bike lanes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 p.m. to 4.30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since this is a fast slippery area, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the scatter is on the move.
If necessary, the police will call him.
The Crib of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long, six-foot-tall animal ran on two powerful hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped jaws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body features, report Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the journal Science Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa at the equator.
Tawa is opening a new window into the early evolution of the dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It tells us a lot about the kinship relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We've sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find confirms theories about early Dino history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt says it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only found in single fragments".
Other dinosaur experts may not necessarily share the same enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current theory, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, however, which is why the attribution of these early dinosaurs is often disputed.
For example, experts debate when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and the birds, known as "long-legged" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithicia, which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, at the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of airbags, which also belong to the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lineage of giant sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups probably produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers conclude that lizards first appeared there.
Thus, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America to all the continents, which at the time were still a single landmass as the supercontinent Pangäa.
The fact that the team together with Tawa Hallae found the remains of two other theropods not particularly closely related speaks for itself.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
He thinks that this may be a distorted view, because there are still a number of primitive dinosaur fossils in South America, while hardly any on other continents.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare lineage of reptilian tribe to the dominant land vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still a mystery.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying acorns, and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the triassic-Jurassic border kinship died out.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the other reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
At least the success story didn't last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to flourish, which had also developed in the Triassic, and since then has been tempting a shadow existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California, are on it.
There are lecturers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen.
The police evacuation of the occupied Frankfurt Goethe University casino is hitting the world's waves.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, as well as from universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement in German and English, they 'disapproved' of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and teachers on strike evacuated last week because of the painting of walls and artwork.
Five students were injured in the attack.
The damage, the signatories say, did not justify "the violent dismantling of self-organized student and teacher training by a police command".
The evacuation represents an 'unacceptable interference' with freedom of research and teaching.
The focus on vandalism is to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and to divert from the content.
The Bureau has refrained from the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand that criminal prosecutions be stopped immediately.
The majority of the occupants were not supportive of the damage.
The protest is legitimated
The youth of the Verdi and the German Trade Union Confederation are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for the future of the people, says Alexander Klein, the Verdi-Landes-Jugendensekretär.
The Hessian Minister for Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the president of the union.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a press conference on Thursday in Wiesbad's parliament.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, says CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, they have been left alone.
The Left has submitted a request asking the Home Secretary to report on the police operation.
The new Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a heavily guarded site for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the commune, with its 216,000 inhabitants, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley" 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow.
Important research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, Selenograd's representatives had been in contact with the Riedberg research centre in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Selenograd Prefect Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation, and Frankfurt's planning director Edwin Schwarz signed.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the Science Foundation will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "green city") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Brake lining of Stuttgart
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be put high enough.
The project's proponents are simply talking about the 'new heart of Europe'.
S21 is much more than a railway station being lowered, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the state capital of Baden-Württemberg into a decade of unhealthy construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
The railway stations that end in the middle of the city were considered to be 19th-century traffic fossils that served as brake lenses for modern rail transport, since it once took a tremendous amount of time to turn locomotives from the back to the front.
Drive, hold, keep going. That's the way it should be.
And that's why the headquarters should disappear: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava on the trans-European railway, hence the slogan of the 'heart of Europe'.
S21 is now actually being tackled, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless to implement the deep-water project in the Hessian and Bavarian cities.
However, headway stations no longer have any problem with entering and exiting as modern trams with motor vehicles and steering cars are available at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now approaching alongside the new ICE route to Ulm.
State and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is also involved because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by taxpayers rather than by the state-owned group.
The project can still be justified in some way in terms of urban planning.
A new urban dream is being created, which, according to the computer-generated graphics of the planners, is equipped with plenty of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The passenger station and the extension of the line are designed for passenger traffic, which has been attributed to a huge growth, typically in the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for cheap planes.
Modern transport policy must first of all strengthen freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
However, the new construction area is not suitable for freight trains due to the heavy increases.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
The Commission has already decided to extend the scope of the proposal to the Member States.
That's the official number.
Experts say 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade, money will be lacking at other nodes and bottlenecks on the net.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km stretch of the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the track has been built at a time-lapse pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley is becoming a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government reviewing the airport ruling
The provincial government has made it clear in the Wiesbad Landtag whether it will review the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (HGH) on the night-time flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the 400-page judgment of the European Court of Human Rights legally examined, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had on that date stated in writing that the country would have to re-regulate the nighttime flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned North West runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 11pm and 5am, as provided for by the provincial government, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population from nighttime noise.
The Coalition must decide by January 4 whether to go against the judgment in a review.
The opposition criticized this delay and urged the government representatives to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD group leader Torsten Schafer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises of a night flight ban, otherwise it would be considered a "breach of the word".
It's a hell of a lot harder to keep your word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schafer-Gumbel that the state government is trying to get back on its night flights with "lawlessness and trickery".
A thorough legal exam takes her time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legal solution, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition has argued that the statements made by his group on the night ban were never true.
US banks are repaying aid
The crisis-shaken US central banks are stripping off their government bonds.
The Bank of America on Wednesday paid back a total of $45 billion in aid from the Tarp Banking Rescue Fund.
And Citigroup is also planning to repay the state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions are thus seeking to remove the restrictions that have been associated with the acceptance of the money  such as the limitation on the payment of management bonuses and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised $19 billion of new money from investors over convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from her own cashier, which was well filled, among other things, by the sale of shares.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night expressly for helping us through a very difficult time.
The money house had reached the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to acquire money on the capital market in order to be exempt from its obligations to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a major capital increase of around $20 billion, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Quick choice
It all happened faster than I thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF board of directors removed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the committee was going to vote on the staff.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, to avoid the procedure.
However, it is also likely that the ZDF's deputy director Markus Schächter played a role in preventing further damage if this proposal was not passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schachter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The results of the vote were not yet published at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him, and Brender's election was a rough defeat for the Schachters, but one that was expected.
The EU's majority on the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that they did not want Brender to be confirmed.
The first was the opposition to the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
On the grounds that the ZDF's news programmes had lost their power rates under Brender, he rejected the highly regarded editor-in-chief's further term of office.
Until shortly before the elections, there were protests in which political influence on the ZDF was condemned.
Lastly, 35 state legislators intervened in the debate, who considered the Koch procedure unconstitutional.
It's not worth it.
Per person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romance.
After that he worked for Southwest Radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, initially the "today-journal".
Subsequent posts: from 1988 to 1990 personal speaker to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 editor and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the election of Brender, who was voted Journalist of the Year by the industry's newspaper Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch's opponent on the board, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, declared last week that the countries should amend the ZDF State Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory bodies was also excluded.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever gesture - sharply criticizing the board for this right after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was nominated by both the Schachter and the Board of Directors without losing his face.
In party arithmetic, Frey is still considered a left-leaning liberal.
Study is being trampled
After a year of education strikes, the ministers of culture of the countries finally agreed on Thursday at a meeting of the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Rectors of Higher Education to improve the conditions of study at bachelor and master levels.
The students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of examination: in principle, each study module should be completed with only one examination.
The aim is to review the workload of students and to ensure 'a realistic and reasonable level'.
The policy and higher education institutions also aim to simplify the recognition of examination performance between higher education institutions within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor and master programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no derogation from national rules.
Less testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been speaking in their mouths of the wings of better studying.
Now, for the first time, it was filled with a concrete content.
The Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of examinations partly drastically: "Each module usually ends with only one examination", says a 30-page paper intended to partly re-regulate the admission of courses.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Council, explained that the "significant reduction in the examination burden" should "stop a development that significantly impaired the studying ability".
In addition, 'studiable' is to be the 'critical criterion' in future design.
Modules such as content are "strictly to be checked" for "unnecessary difficulties of students in choosing the
The Commission will also be able to take action to ensure that the measures taken are not distorted.
The students would have "the right to be given a space to play which enables and encourages their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses but also to the review of existing ones.
These must be 'reaccredited' every five years  which means that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
The national accreditation bodies responsible for this are ten accreditation agencies, which are under the responsibility of the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture urged the countries to "strengthen" their efforts to ensure that the supply of material is not too high and the testing regime not too strict.
In some German states, universities and technical colleges have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
The only country to date to have allocated additional funds to the further development of the Bologna process was the Rhineland-Palatinate.
The funds will be used to establish tutoring programmes and strengthen study counselling and examination and foreign offices.
The country and the universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
In early 2010, the government intends to introduce a new version of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only one test is required to complete a study model.
The aim is to make the design of studies more flexible, to ensure the recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of the year, all the curricula in the country are to be checked for their accessibility.
The government and opposition had again argued on Thursday about the conditions for study in the country.
But in addition to praise, there was criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso-High School Groups demanded that education policy should no longer be shaped "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
The students should now "speak a word" as affected students at the latest after the educational strikes.
The future academics were supported by the President of the Conference of Rectors of Higher Education (CHE), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students", she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom the CHE is discussing a joint reform paper.
The Bonn decision-making process was not sufficiently successful: it called for a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor's degree to pursue a further master's degree.
Second, countries must ensure that the current generation of bachelor students will have sufficient master's places available tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, says Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Board.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
The Ministers of Culture, however, did not comment on a more open access to the Master.
More than one footnote on Herta Müller
Getting into Germany and out is pretty much uncontrollable"... is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which this disturbingly tongue-in-cheek theme is the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in Banat, Romania, in 1951, Werner Söllner worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He was a major figure in the literary scene during a meeting in Munich on Tuesday, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its securities".
Visibly unsure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted to his Romanian-German writing colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, that he was working as an IM for the Romanian intelligence service Securitate.
In 1989, together with some of those present, Söllner was awarded the German Language Prize.
The recruitment efforts had begun in a sluggish manner, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "someone who has not resisted enough the attempts of intimidation by the Securitate".
The lyricist Werner Söllner is in Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary engagement with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literary scene and in particular the community of Romanian-born German authors is being shaken by a case that shows the depths and the inferiority of a political system based on surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only the perpetrator but also the victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, literary scholar Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He "cut him out" in all the difficult points he faced at the time, Markel said.
He has a moral need to make this remark.
Söller's statement was in the form and in front of this audience unexpected, but it is quite surprising that a former dissident's confession and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not.
Germany was a comfortable reserve for Securitate Spitzel, Herta Müller wrote in July, at the time, after reading her own 914-page file.
The people involved, it is to be expected, are speculating and in some cases probably knew what kind of name was hidden behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike the very strict procedure in which Stasi files are now seized, the handling of the legacy of securities supervision is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been hindered and hindered.
A National Securities Acting Council (CNSAS) body, which is the Birthler authority, was only established in 1999, but the issuance of the securities has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very strong, according to an interview with Herta Müller after the announcement of the Nobel Prize, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar spoke negatively about the winner.
She's psychotic, after all, she's only been interviewed once.
The infamy of power here thought it was free to express itself in a very open way.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the draft budget.
The astonishing reaction of the audience to Soller's confession leaves hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge rather than blame and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Satisfaction certificate of the Champions League
It seemed as if a well-dressed field servant was just arriving from a very nice Christmas party where a sportswear manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of equipment, climbed into a C-class class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive hair was driven to a city he never knew.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and drunk on luck was not the 55-year-old either.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we'll continue the work.
Or start right away.
In the words of the Swiss who had committed three days earlier: "We have reached the final eight", in the Champions League thanks to a 3-1 win against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let the success blind us: it will be a brutal hard fight against the relegation".
The "much more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the performance of the royal classes in the daily life of the league in Mainz.
And to remove the weaknesses that were once again revealed after the fast three goals by Marica (5), Trash (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Tickets
The Champions League Eight Final (matches 16/17 + 23/24 February/ replay 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be played in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the Babbel successor's fulminant conviction was thus kept to itself.
Not just the supposed savior who in a short time had taught the unsure Stuttgarter professionals confidence, willingness to work and joy in the game.
I went to the players and told them to think about their strengths, and I kept them from being brave, soul-planner Gross explained the so-so-simply-sounding recipe for success, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has unleashed a certain kind of magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes to football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury, was the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamic, tried to describe the phenomenon with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new manager's way of working: "He's a man who is proficient and demands discipline.
That's what we need in this situation".
Babbel had obviously been wrong about it.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs consistency.
As a matter of fact, players and managers were also careful not to overestimate the victory against a weak and overwhelmingly overwhelming defense of the Romanian guests.
They would have won in Glasgow, too, before the evil awakening came four days later at 04:00 in Leverkusen, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that while one season goal had been reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
Held's 40th birthday, even after his first home victory in three months, was not a celebration, as it was the events of the weekend that brought fresh life to the scene in the form of a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the game began.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership failure and decided to change coaches under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann also saw his free day after games as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure selfishness", Heldt replied, announcing consequences for the final man.
I don't think they'll be friends for life, the two 40-year-olds.
But they agreed with everyone else that the game and combat-related feat would not have been possible without the training of the team.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success", said Heldt and Lehmann unison - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World heavyweight championship
Hot duel in Bern: Time and again, challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title, according to the WBC version.
The judgement of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated U.S. Kevin Johnson by unanimous vote in Bern on Saturday night (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
Klitschko's third successful title defense since his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian has previously been World Champion twice in the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the K.O. everyone expected.
Klitschko built his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th battle.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena, the 6-foot-tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, primarily with his left leading hand.
But the six-inch-small Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly withdrew the World Champion's blows, so Klitschko could not decisively finish his dangerous rights.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and just tried to get through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided some swirling before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, the champion was prompted to shove his sunglasses off Johnson's nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth win after Klitschko 's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of absence, he had defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "WBC" belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in his title defense.
I only got one hit in that fight and I'm in very good shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to unite all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA belt is now held by the British man David Haye, who succeeded in unseating the 2.13-meter-tall Nikolai Valuyev in November.
Haye had earlier cancelled a September fight against Vitali Klitschko in the summer.
His promotional agency is reportedly already planning the fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
Case reported
Frontline attack from the opposition: Green faction leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar for misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the left are demanding an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has alleged a deliberate deception.
The minister said "wittingly the lie" about the deadly bombing of two petrol-loaded trains in September, said the Green Party chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It's called land-based: he lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about targeting two Taliban leaders.
According to a NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US airstrike ordered by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
The Green, SPD and Left on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak out immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and fellow Green MEP Renate Künast.
The government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellery has not been influencing the Bundeswehr's concrete operations in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the Ministry's statement on the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs correctly and fully informed the people about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, they said they denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, the two top officials' environment reported that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defence for several reports, including a two-sided document from Commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification in a letter, reports the Frankfurt-based daily.
He hasn't received a response yet, they say.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday, noting that this would be clarified in the Bundestag's investigation committee, which is set to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreams of the future
Some people see images and hear voices while awake, but others do not see or hear.
Not only in the mentally ill and drug addicted, the boundaries between imagination and reality blur.
As long as it happens in your sleep, it's okay.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unrestrainedly indulge in the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike states in waking, seeing and hearing things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as special people.
But such images and voices do not just come from the mentally ill or the drug addict.
It's our imagination that's to blame: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes blur the lines between dream, delusion, and reality.
Dreamy altered states of wakefulness can take many forms, at best we call them visions, at worst madness.
Although triggers and effects may vary, the visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic abduction states, psychosis and hallucinations can all be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neuronal messengers in the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is lost and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 found a "great resemblance of insanity to dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, mind-shifting of such".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and cramped.
Gravity has no power over him, he's floating on the ceiling.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him, winged devils with blood-red, distorted frogs, brushing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Noisy, vicious voices are roaring from walls and radio.
He can't stand the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a trap and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on a speaker and puts the loop around his neck.
- Jump in.
The trap is loose.
"Go to the hospital and get well!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic paranoid psychosis, and he's manic-depressive, he's on medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, he says, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair.
The deceptive images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and psychiatric hospitals treat it as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenia, people are often unable to distinguish between the outside and the inside, and they become overly excited, which can lead to hallucinations, delusions of size, relationships, or persecution.
Specifically, voice listening is common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The person affected can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the door to a flood of ideas and fantasies that spring from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subjectively centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he becomes passive, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and unable to actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
They are often unable to compare reality, the illusionary images are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Having had a hallucination once in my life
But unlike in dreams, Fox says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains basically intact".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain beats capriole is still a mystery to researchers.
Emergencies can cause any person to lose momentary contact with reality, Fox says.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers estimate that the brain damage is minimal.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fox explains.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neural system comes about, which also does not manifest itself at first for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmitting system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer from hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others spend money on drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten, of Lübeck.
Whether or not a fake image is perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of point of view.
For the past ten years, he has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions, and last year he reviewed his findings in the book The Unreal World in Our Minds.
Hallucinations are typical of psychosis, but they are also associated with many other diseases.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's, and traumatic brain injury.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, such as boxes, are composed of memory contents that are usually retained.
They occur when the brain areas where sensory perception is processed are overactive or under-inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal, stress, love-troubles or other mental emergency situations.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the pictures and the voices.
During the break, a slender boy with long dark hair may approach it.
When he answers, the classmates look at him surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
You think the shy girl is a daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She's awake, she's hearing and seeing this boy, just like she's hearing and seeing the girl next to her at the bank.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? She wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other fake images are not real and then disappear.
At night, the phenomena are usually frightening.
Often, the images are a burden.
When she is in the classroom, she can't sometimes follow the instructional material because the teacher is presenting a new classmate in her eyes and ears while he is visually and audibly explaining mathematical equations to everyone else on the table.
At night, the phenomena are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the scratches or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, are emerging before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her anything that they'd think she's crazy.
In the fall of 2009, Sarah K. is 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted the psychologist Kasse on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from a lack of attraction, they are most likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kaste.
I suspect the brain is then under-occupied and provides its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 when she learned that the man she's been calling Daddy for as long as she can remember is not her biological father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusional images and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is in the brain, and reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real".
Even night visionists view casts as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unreal.
So Kaste advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
The boundary between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world that is too consciously centered, imaginary experiences are often pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the Florence Nightingale Hospital's psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a painful, painful disease, but it also contains the positive, the creative - madness is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has been researching the so-called oneiroid experience form, a special form of the tragically altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and that he cannot distinguish from the waking state afterward.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations related to trauma or disease, for example in patients with polyradiculitis who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with loss of self and world, such as permanent, complete disability, he replaces the life-threatening reality with his own, imaginary world, disconnected from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
It's kind of a boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change is taking place, but the real situation is made present in the imagination.
An intensive form of sensation-building and expression in an intolerable situation that allows us humans to not undergo our own creative capacity in the absence of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Changes" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into a self-made world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs out of blood.
Dragged by a Greek on a motorcycle to his homeland, surfing in the Alps with his hospital bed and meeting a Korean mobster.
It's completely gone in the imaginary, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreams are a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, I still remember memories of mental journeys after years and in subtle details.
More vivid and intense than what we've actually experienced.
The intensity of this experience is shattering the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug abuse show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
It is a very enriching experience.
The snowfall may come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher, Kallen, is an intermediate solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to hand his company over to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding is to remain 100% family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at age 27 and have a strong desire to join the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We've arranged the details in advance.
The question whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
The question of whether they are capable of doing so.
You can't have 7,500 employees with your kids if they're not qualified enough.
It's killing the kids and killing the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would step down as CEO from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board of directors of Burda since 1999.
He was first in charge of technology.
Later, the Treasury department added responsibility for the company's assets and, following the departure of Jürgen Todenhofer, direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is in charge of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17, and his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of the stems also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should remain 100% family in the future, Burda said.
In view of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from collapse either: "This always involved families infected by a capitalist addiction, who had completely spoiled themselves and thought they could thus rise to the very top.
That was never my strategy.
He never had a world power dream, Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political presenter of this country, like Springer was, and I don't want to play in the World League with Time, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you desire in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid) where everything is about body care.
The wellness area, located on the eighth floor, includes reputable companies such as Hedonai, which produces laser hair removal; Spaxión, which offers spaces for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdresser Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food service department that boasts more than 130 different types of tea.
Having a relaxing massage with your partner while also having a fantastic view of the capital, or renting a relaxation area for two hours to get your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends on your feet and then relax in the spa or with a massage and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2 and is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus provide them with a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touch screen that's across the device.
Then, you'll see different videos showing you how to do your training sessions properly.
The head of the fitness studio assures us that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to train the muscles of the body.
And if you want to go to the hair salon after you've trained your body, Luis & Tachi has a room where you can get treatment to restore your hair's beauty, shine and health in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be keywords for this wellness area in the heart of the city, which is always open from 10am to 10pm, 365 days a year.
The most varied of decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer, and that's why it's another great opportunity to copy the looks of the stars and bring their wedding dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the decolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points to consider.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The LIFE Office will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and make arrangements for mobility through management, coordination, subsidisation, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise the opinions and actions of the sectors involved.
This is an attempt to drive forward the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also taking part in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include, but are not limited to, activities related to energy and in particular to its performance.
It is not, however, the only initiative in which Endesa is participating in the promotion of the electric car.
The company is involved in standards groups throughout Europe and has and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees a "horizon of tranquility" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesy of a "horizon of calm" for the Spanish automobile industry, which is the country's largest exporter.
In presenting the 2009 Economic Report by the Prime Minister, Mr Zapatero recalled the measures the Government has taken to support the automotive sector during the year of the Government.
"Without the competitiveness plan for the automotive industry, we would have a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants", the Prime Minister explained.
'Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the carmakers to continue producing in Spain in a highly competitive industry, we can see a calm future for the growth of this industry, which is our largest export industry,' he added.
It also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall Automotive Industry Plan (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided for investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to boost demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which are implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the automobile manufacturers.
According to the Prime Minister, this plan allows to reduce emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in authorisations, which increased by "40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Car Fair, an exhibition for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world, is being held in Madrid.
This exhibition will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition will feature 200 exhibitors from both the country and abroad, representing their brands in an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres.
Not only can you admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all the imaginary items related to the world of motors at ClassicAuto Madrid.
The exhibitors can find accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc.
Hundreds of items from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and enthusiasts alike.
Among the companies participating in this exhibition are Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of cars specialising in Mercedes Benz.
Skills tests in the outdoor sector
In addition, the sales activities at this fair are complemented by parallel events: meetings, sports car exhibitions, skill tests, events and competitions.
Skill tests are also carried out on classic cars and motorcycles on a specially designed race track in the outdoor area of the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sporting and environmentally friendly
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with environmental protection.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine, i-stop, for the Mazda3 model, a device which is currently only available for the 150 hp 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the running of the vehicle, the comfort, the strain behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good posture.
The game of steering wheel is also excellent.
Further examination of the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and dashboard, shows that with a variety of buttons and switches in the stunning colors of red and blue, Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards futuristic interior design.
This style is partly reminiscent of the Honda Civics style.
It is therefore clear that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are distinguished from the German automobile, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to outperform.
The passenger space of these two Japanese compact cars offers more comfort than ever, so that four adults can ride the car in extreme comfort.
And all of this is accompanied by a large, well-shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 150 hp 2-litre petrol engine with a 6-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure, distinguished by its finesse, its quiet sound, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many miles a year should consider this gasoline-powered i-stop because of its gross comfort in the gear and low power consumption, even though Mazda's diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sporting model selected for the test is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The series release highlights the RVM, which eliminates the dead angle, as well as the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the large screen on-board computer, the parking sensors, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and the chrome-plated 17-inch bands.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the premium package, which for an additional €1,500 includes the following: in addition to other elements, especially the learning Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD-loaders.
The conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only downside to this model is its slightly high price, which is between €21,770 for the luxury model and €23,270 for the sporty model tested.
But in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the new highest driving speed every day.
A glamorous premiere
L.A. is rolling the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of Nine, the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shone more than ever.
Our Pe, as elegant as ever, chose a dark lady dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that allows you to read your emails without having the ability to see certain attachments or browse the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
It is unlikely that it will be seen on the street, but the idea itself is of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example, only half the price of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company launched two new devices: one designed for Twitter only, the other with a lifetime free data service, as opposed to Peek, which costs six times more.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but it has a surprise in store.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to forgo all the data to read their emails once they cross the border or when they are desperate to find a cafe with WIFI (or a connection to Fon).
The idea of flat-rate roaming is incredibly tempting and should have been possible a long time ago.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the small printed material.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside your own country, you're always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (which is always surprising that it has the name Fon, even though it doesn't have Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariff means that phone providers are slowly but surely having to rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, with prices including book downloads and other online requests.
No coat and no hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay once, when you buy it, not month by month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a lifetime Internet purchase option that Peek already offers in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I'm reading my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
She was already wearing a dress and a coat of this color when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, and she chose the same color to accompany him at the second most important moment of his life, no doubt, the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny greenish- - the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric - and she wore something coarse-stitched or a necklace.
In fact, at first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the material they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a top dress and in Oslo a patterned vest.
The accessories were also different: the first time, green shoes with half-high heels, and the second time, a model of a woman, but gold.
The hairstyle was also different each time: the hair was tied up as a haircut on this occasion, the previous time she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want children.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and career of women in Spain', carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 shows that 75% of women in employment see their career opportunities on the labour market as being limited by their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children depending on whether women work or not and, if so, what kind of profession they do.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have no fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with fixed jobs, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the age group of 35 to 49 with a fixed job do not have their first child on average until 3.7 years after the marriage, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women in fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have not had their first child much later.
In addition, the nature of work has a major impact on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of the readiness to conceive", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor to be taken into account in the age of women at marriage and first child.
According to the survey, the older the person is at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the 35-49 age group, whether they have only a high school diploma or higher education, became mothers for the first time, on average, at 25.1 or 32.1.
Furthermore, there is another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While women with a master's degree get married before their first job and have their first child, women with a high school diploma or a middle school diploma do things differently and first look for a job and then marry and have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its envious list of female ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year onwards, the German actress will be the image of various brand products and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you're worth it".
The lead actress of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, will become another famous public figure, as did Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanishwoman Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last people allowed to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly and Freida Pinto.
The men's cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's acting partner in "Lost").
The awarding of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Its top representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony held at the Royal Court of Justice in London.
They all appeared for that occasion.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model of the year.
The game of poker by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker des Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) the three-dimensional X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearful genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a likeness to the Creator's burning heart.
The journey is exciting and Vicent is not spared any terror or enlightenment.
Besides being a delightful book, this book is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "Reading its pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt without finding words for it: the joy in contrast to miserable fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him".
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was enchanted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were combined with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege of entering heaven on the way of destruction".
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, and is one of the 8,000 peaks in world literature to climb up the north wall, the wall where the best climbers try again and again".
About William Faulkner: "That was a funny thing.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir to a county landowner and again that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore a certain gravity".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the mad cry that was shouted from a bridge by that person from Munich, so that his echo would echo into the night of the 20th century in his literary way.
Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'My venerable God, I ask you to do all in your power to make me stop writing like a woman.'"
Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses of Spencer: 'The sleep after toil, after the storm of the harbour, after the calm after war, after a rich life, one finds pleasure in death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with perfect normalcy when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or the birds were singing in Greek.
There is not a single other case known where the man showed such patience and fell in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was far greater than her madness".
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín Santos do but try to get Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet mean when he didn't bring Baroja to Faulkner's arms?
What did Cela do, other than destroy that man's fame so he can put himself on this podium?"
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week when suddenly a group of young people aged 15 to 18 came alongside her and our dog, our dog is a mixed-breed that we brought from the animal shelter and weighs just six kilograms, and then out of nowhere they missed two steps and seriously injured him.
Our indignation cannot be expressed in words, since it is incomprehensible to us, whereas the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on the line.
And then there's the choking attack that a woman who was walking comfortably suffered when she tried to correct these people for the incident, even fearing for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he might do the same thing to a woman, a child, an older gentleman, or probably even anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood of the city at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been barking all day.
We have reported to a nearby police station, of course, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything about and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our outrage at what happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be going on in the minds of these young people, that they find it amusing to attack cheaply a helpless animal, an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial) to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets, as they are the only protective device that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which 'is much more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming safer every day', and further reaffirmed that it also contributes to this goal by taking a step closer every day with other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on motorcycles, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will in its first phase distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is 'a constant concern' for the company, and precisely because it is committed to developing ever safer products as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives must be to develop ever safer products.
Small-truck sales are rising again
After almost two years, the small-car market is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, more importantly, the first steady decline in the number of vehicles registered in Spain after 22 consecutive months, according to figures from the Anfac Manufacturers' Association and the Ganvam Association of Car Dealers.
However, these good figures should be used with caution at the moment, as the reference data used for the comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly poor sales year, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the previous month, the total authorisations for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold since January, but this figure includes all vehicles comprising the small car market: descendants of passenger cars, pickup trucks, small trucks, small delivery trucks and lighter small trucks/carriages.
In addition, the same storm clouds are still in the sky that are most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the bulk of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of cases make purchases with third-party financing.
The Commission has therefore decided to extend the scope of the directive to the Member States.
In this scenario, unlike passenger cars, financial support for the purchase of a vehicle under the 2000E plan has been of little help.
This plan is not only for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small businesses if they want to buy a small van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
The Commission has also been able to draw up a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the environment.
The Association of Motor Dealers predicts that 2010 will be similar to the year just before, with a sales loss of 19% (in passenger cars and SUVs).
Support for braking maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as is now the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly authorised passenger cars and light-duty vans, and a waiting period has been set for the remaining vehicles until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's measures aim to improve the protection of pedestrians, but because of their functioning, these braking systems can also help prevent many accidents.
The emergency braking assistant's task is to apply more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake operator, which detects the brake pedal system by the brake force exerted by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure to the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the Bosch vehicle component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not step on the brake pedal at all before the collision and half of them had not brake off at full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, penetrates the braking system with maximum force, thus reducing the braking time and thus the braking distance travelled by a car during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents could be prevented with injuries - once the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
The vehicle is then equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and alerts the driver, while also applying a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant shall apply maximum pressure to the brakes to minimise the damage.
General Motors postpones Opel to January
While Opel's staff at the Figueruelas plant in Zaragoza have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8 April, according to Javier Ortega, the American automaker is indicating that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the party concerned gives its consent to each and every point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the works are located, may be delayed until early 2010.
On the other hand, GM assures that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to contacting some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which would like to buy Volvo as well, but the option of the Dutch Skyper sports car manufacturer, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining increasing popularity.
If no agreement is reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some of its assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be upheld.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their latest and most expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis, and they actually managed to make it 80 pounds lighter, bringing it to just 1,275 pounds.
To achieve this, they first abandoned the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a manual-driven tent roof, saving 21 kilos; 15 more were "disappeared" thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3, and 13 more were cut by the removal of the air conditioning system; the fuel tank was reduced from 64 litres to 54 litres, saving another 7 kilos; 12 more were saved by the installation of sporting bacquet seats and five more by the light 19-inch straps.
Then, by abandoning the CDR-30 audio system, the weight was reduced by another six kilos and the missing weight was achieved by replacing the door handles with fabric handles.
Although it is also available with the dual-clutch PDK, the test drive was conducted with a 6-wheel drive vehicle, mainly on the smaller California country slopes, on mountain tracks that were really very curvy.
The only way to get him to the grade is to drive him impeccably.
However, the reduction in weight did not mean that he would not be so safe on the straw.
The opposite is true: we have not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, but it also gives a feeling of greater safety in the corners, even at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to keep his muscles warm at low gear for the time required until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then again get everything out of his engine...
The car does everything we point to it with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of its 320 hp V6 boxer (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and can be increased with the 'sport' option and a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginably brutal, whether it's standing up or accelerating again.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the road we drove the Boxster Spyder was already pretty damaged, but the car was getting through the punch holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and this, although at some of these corners we found ice in the morning dew and roll split in the morning.
In short, it's an ultra-light car, a car that gives you an indescribable driving pleasure, which you probably rarely get, and it's much more than just a small improvement on the Boxster SS.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70,831.
Bag girl
The singer, a friend of Karl Lagerfeld's, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional star at the fashion shows of Maison, presenting her evil face with the same stiffness of her neck as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia is giving itself a victory in Israel
Despite the many outstanding players in Dusko Ivanovic's team, Caja Laboral celebrated an outstanding 82-91 victory on its visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra, placing first in its group after Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times the best of his team (29th in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they waited until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triplets contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blue Reds, who from the beginning were sitting at the top of the billboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria had already left the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come to the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the Álava team opted for an inside-out game by Barac and for the game by Eliyahu, who was welcomed with whistles and applause upon his return to the team that is his home to expand their advantage further until the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to emerge as the best of his team with 13 points, even though Splitter's "minus six" rating already suggested this would not be the Brazilian's best night.
However, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was long before decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their field of play, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini were instrumental in getting the Yellow to turn the wheel (50-49).
More disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, wounded but all but dead, had to prepare a few moves with a certain aim to get back in the air and one of them suddenly came with the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with almost three consecutive threes and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that the signboard again showed a calming distance of (54-67) which the host could beautify with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavens were blown up in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take back the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, the best of their team, Pnini and Eidson, did not resign and tried to give their team back strength by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was dismissed for fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still picked up at the last minute (80-85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being thrown in the forehead.
Unicaja lost to Olympiacos in Greece and had to give up the lead in Euroleague Group B to him in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially at home, which facilitated the Greeks' victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the hall of peace and friendship or of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game in the first quarter, the Andalusians began to dream, with an aggressive defense and three consecutive triplets, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinding the hosts with a 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja arena, even though the home team managed to score 22-20 in their favour in the 13th minute, the minute when an action almost led to a clash between the two Americans Beverley and Williams, which disqualified both.
The Greek team was finally starting to warm up and its superiority in both halves of the game, while the exit of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes of Carlos Jiménez themselves left clear marks at the Unicaja.
Among their players in the field and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their lead in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A hunt was impossible
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to balance the difference of 66-48 in the 27th minute of the match in Málaga, which in turn led to a fluctuation in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the departure of the Scottishman Robert Archibald who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, thanks to the lead and triple of Cook and the use of Lewis, in the 31st minute, some hope was restored to 66-57.
However, it was actually impossible, because once the Olympiacos attacked and showed their superiority within the basket area, they could not be stopped.
In the 37th minute, Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket gap to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give up and had to give up the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now find out what they should be earning based on their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads for real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates users' salaries based on the more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain.
A week after the application was first made available, the search engine found that the average Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explains the product manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data available to Trovit through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, compared with the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
Accordingly, a truck driver has an annual net income of EUR 34,247 in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with a net annual income of €11,592; followed by the job of a salesman with €14,725 and that of a worker with €15,667.
The most-visited jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil has set a date for Zelaya to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-elect shall leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his term of office officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that Mel Weiβ must have left the embassy where he had been granted asylum since 21 September.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, as his term of office expires on that day and he must find a new place to stay".
The broadcaster also quoted the former president as confirming his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek asylum in Brazil.
However, this failed because Zelayas refused to recognize the status of an asylum seeker who was forced to do so by the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The main objective of market stabilisation was to settle the debt by directly buying assets and to indirectly release liquidity at zero interest rates, thus allowing banks to purchase assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct asset purchases are almost complete and, without calling into question their heterodox liquidity policies, are beginning to spread some sand into the grid, as the ECB had already predicted with its annual sale next week.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Commission, and we are now in favour of the amendments.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and the public debt was rising again.
The emphasis is now on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred places of refuge for investors, which in turn increases the differences between the eurozone countries in relation to Germany.
Spain has been hardly affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor's came along and threatened to downgrade its rating.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not hurt to silence the moral risk advocates who have tried again to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy of what they have caused, as they have slowed down the devastating effects of the credit restrictions that have led to the loss of jobs when they should have actually decided on a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the emirates to restore power in the emirates and developments in Greece have been predicted before.
A government that hides the public debt, elections and a new government that is on the same page.
Prodi did it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It is pointless that Ecofin will save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro country to default on its obligations.
It is logical, however, that Ecofin forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for exceptional reductions in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
We are, as expected, in the face of an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some deviations to too high amounts, which would now be within the expectations.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the national debt gaps are increasing at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
If, however, the differences between Europe and Spain continue to increase, there would be a special risk for Spain.
While the local preferred indicators force a large part of market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to adjust their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are again coming up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise longevity despite warnings.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it is said to be "careful when driving".
Connected branches
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, first spoke yesterday before the House Subcommittee, where the strategy for Spain's energy supply over the next two decades is being debated.
After his speech, which was followed by Gas Natural-Fenosa's chairman Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave some points to the press about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another EUR 60 billion from this date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that investment should no longer be in increasing energy generation capacity but in distribution networks and international alliances.
The question will change from 2020 onwards and the performance should be increased.
The proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, above all on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, subject, of course, to other 'supporting energies'.
Galán, who believes that the sustainable economy bill just passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, was not going to say anything against the bill, like to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the exact opposite of all political strategies to combat climate change.
He said that "this is a clear longterm trend, despite some 'individual' shortcomings, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions should be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives the "Handling" from Aer Lingus to ten airports
The Swissport subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground-based airport services is the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage services at ten European airports where it is represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been published, is for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation to create an innovation centre for smart infrastructure yesterday.
The Alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to study energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market in which it is already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction of the tunnel is estimated to cost A$1.7 billion (about EUR1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A five-kilometer tunnel in the eastern coastal city of Brisbane, Australia, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and motorway operator in the country.
The city administration wants to complete the construction by the end of 2014.
After the decision of the Public-Private Partnership Administration (PPP) to pursue the project in accordance with a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and customs administration.
In anticipation of the proposals presented in May, the estimated investment is A$1.7 billion (EUR1.047 billion), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy and is one of the best specialists in underground construction.
The team from Acciona is joined by the Northern Direct consortium, which consists of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure, and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium, which is in close proximity, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the French Razel, which specialises in public works.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisation, but there is a barrier to overcome, as access is only possible through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy which the companies referred to above, Hochtief or Bilfinger, have followed in addition to Asian references, and which the Spanish construction giants have yet to pursue.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market by owning a 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Million in assets
Acciona is based on this geographical area of the highest importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies charged with building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
It is now its intention to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the building and infrastructure sectors.
The underground toll route, which will be financed by the City of Brisbane's Infrastructure Authority and will be built by Northern Link, is intended to link the Western Highway in Toowong with the Bypass Road in Kelvin Grove via tunnels over a length of 5 kilometres, the largest reduction in traffic on Brisbane's streets.
The roadmap issued by the municipality envisages the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll route is already scheduled to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, construction is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government is contributing A$500 million (308 million euros) to the financing.
Brisbane is a big deal for the deep sea.
Australia is constantly awarding substantial contracts to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a 154-million-dollar contract with the government.
ACS will improve the infrastructure of its domestic broadband network with fibre optic cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide 400,000 people with fast internet access and will keep the German company employed for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27 story King George Tower project in Brisbane, Australia, which has not yet started and for which Hochtief has received 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it is competing with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has obtained, through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres for a motorway in Slovenia for the sum of EUR 64,5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the contract for the construction work to extend the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) of more than 130 million.
In this way Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore receives a promotional letter from Renfe
Renfe has awarded Ms Rushmore advertising and marketing services for the next two years, totalling approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway company said.
The contract also provides for two 12-month renewals.Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented the competition, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
The fine of over 63 million for France Télécom for the braking of competition.
France Télécom has been fined EUR 63 million by the French competition authority for anti-competitive conduct in its Caribbean territories.
The Authority claims that the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the brink of regulation.
Alongside this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 for disabling its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased as the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore fallen back.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary followed the example of other telephone providers and opened an application trading page on the Internet to increase revenues from non-telephone transactions.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 for this Siete to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League game has earned Madrid and Barca 476.4 million since the start.
The Champions League has been a source of income for the football club since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken in 476.4 million, which puts them in third and fifth place among the highest-earning football clubs in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, but it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
The league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) participating in the event since its inception in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The club is the third largest European club in terms of revenue and the only one to have won the trophy three times, after AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is in fifth place.
The list includes Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money by participating in the previous Champions League.
And that's despite losing to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to have won the Championships, although it has more titles than any other (five compared with four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money distribution procedure used by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA has provided 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who qualified for the contest received 3.8 million from their only presence, plus the 550,000 euros for each contest.
There is also a bonus for the winner (€800,000) and for the draw (€400,000 per team).The clubs that have reached the eighth round receive three million each; the four that have reached the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four get four million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
A football club receives at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million by winning the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also variable payments for which 337.8 million is provided.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first to do so and has four seats.
Last year's champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for a 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details yesterday of the stock offer it intends to buy between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which does not compel them to make an OPA due to the number of shares.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, paid over ten years at an annual rate of 1% as a result of this shift.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa valued the company at 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1,50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jeréz Group gives the shareholders a period of 15 days to notify their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
The amount of the deposit would be 611.7 million if it were closed, while the value of Sos would be 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an effort to stay out of the way of possible bids and the legal disputes of his former managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food business.
This is a newly created position directly under the Chairman of the Group.
This is all but free of controversy because the company is engaged in a legal battle over the suspicion of diverting more than 230 million SOs to other Salazar companies.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
As regards the Salazar loan, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) spoke yesterday before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the tender for Paternina submitted by investment company Mer
The National Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The Authority stated that it had approved the invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were in accordance with the applicable laws and that the content of the declaration sheet submitted could therefore be considered 'sufficient', as amended on 2 December.
CNMV also stated that this offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, which is 8,95% of the share capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares listed on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was reported that 5,592,778 million shares were fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and the price of which was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the applicable laws.
New vehicle evaluation programmes
In these days of storms and accidents, it is not only the automotive factories that earn
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an assessor must assess the damage and repair costs.
No accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000 per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the contrary, with the help of the latest computer tools, it is only a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of the experts use these types of systems.
Accident assessment and repair service and application providers shall collect the information they receive from manufacturers for subsequent processing and provide it to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera Group, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are produced with its products.
The other two companies competing in the tool market for assessment and reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's sales manager, 63 manufacturers and importers are cooperating, each providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been released than in all the previous 15 years.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the business begins to work.
It is a laborious task, because each of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catalogued and priced.
In addition, each model creates a "smart" graphic image that lets you "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If the model is a sold-out model, the work can be completed in a week if the process is carried out quickly.
In the case of a less used car, it may take up to three or four months.
For example, in the more exclusive models, they have information on Porsche models but not on Ferrari or Lamborghini.
The number of vehicles on the straits is over 99%.
For the purpose of documentation and database production, Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in a particular brand.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics specialists) working simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
They're recording 2.5 million data every month, and their customers get the updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap or calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide to inform about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this service in Spain, but in the United States.
Audatex's products are easy to see and understand the support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard solution for accident prevention for the evaluators.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it contains the manufacturer's estimated repair times or paint prices.
This tool is paid for by use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive is for customers who use it rarely, up to ten times a month, i.e. 5.75 euros a month.
In contrast, every insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow a vehicle and the equipment it was running on from the assembly line to be fully identified by the driver's license plate number alone.
AudaGlass is involved in vehicle discs and AudaSubastas is an internet service open to the specialist market for vehicles declared to be totally damaged.
Their statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or obtaining information on variations by brand and model.
For example, it can be used to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go into the workshop due to gaps or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company devoted to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for evaluators and similarly provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer's working hours.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of vehicle damage, breakdowns and maintenance.
The GT Leader for Assessment is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 consultants and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% per annum over the last three years and in 2008 it had sales of EUR 10,8 million.
At the beginning of last year they also began to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and in Spain in 1979.
According to the company, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The total worldwide sales of Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounted to $557 million, an increase of 3,35 million compared to 2008.
In the Netherlands, the company had revenue of EUR 19.1 million, up 7.2% from the previous year.
In 2005, Solera was listed on the stock exchange at $1 billion and today its shares are trading at $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's index.
Auction of unfaulty cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought an online platform for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase represented the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added services, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively for industry professionals such as insurance companies, auditors, car rental companies, workshops, landfills and car dealers who must register before they can operate.
The platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 evaluators.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle with a registration number may no longer be used on the road, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The historic cars, on the other hand, may be re-approved even if they have been declared after difficult government procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in only four steps: vehicle identification, search for spare parts, and cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer technologies.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the driver's license plate number, a graph of the model will appear and the required spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for the hours worked, the upper prices or the discounts and then have the cost estimate printed and passed on to his customers.
AudaTaller is not a review tool like AudaPlus, however, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, which is an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Audatex is currently working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, because you can choose a door, for example, and then you can completely turn the image around to look inside.
