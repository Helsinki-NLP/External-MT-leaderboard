The spectacular wingsuit jump over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over the Colombian capital Bogota on Thursday.
Fitted with a wingsuit, he flew at 100 miles per hour over the famous sanctuary of Monserrate, at an altitude of over 3,000 meters, where many scoundrels had gathered to observe his feat.
A black box in your car?
While road planners in the United States are struggling to find the money to repair the ageing highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that is attached above the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record every mile driven by a motorist and pass the information on to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to overhaul the outdated system of financing major U.S. roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axis planning has suddenly given rise to a lively debate and heated alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly the road you drive, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is down.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress can't agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They're looking at how, over the next decade, they can move to a system where drivers pay based on the number of miles driven.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring systems, for a test drive.
This is absolutely essential for our nation.
 It's not like we have a choice , said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which expects the state to start recording the miles traveled by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't been raised in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gas prices are high.
 The tax on gasoline is simply not sustainable , said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had tracers installed on 500 cars to test a mile-paying system.
 This is the most logical alternative in the long term, he said.
Wonks calls this mileage usage charge.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in ways that reduce congestion and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to meet the goals set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also saw it as the most viable alternative in the long run.
Free market supporters of the Reason Foundation also like the idea of charging drivers for the mile.
 It is not just a tax that is sinking into a big black hole , said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The movement is also supported by two former US Transportation Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the mile-paying route.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the House of Lords President killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or to the city.
However, several states and large cities are making progress on their own.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the largest experiment in the country.
These motorists will soon be paying the state for mileage instead of taxes on gasoline.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is testing it on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states along the East Coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is looking at how it could implement the change.
The concept is not universally successful.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteer drivers recently fitted their cars with a device, drivers were concerned that the government might be able to track their every move.
"The concerns about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the start of the trial, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website:  It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location-tracking devices. 
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states that is now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will feel more comfortable.
Research into this technology has led some state agencies to call in a small California startup called True Mileage.
The company was not originally intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It was looking to break into the emerging market of car insurance, where drivers would pay based on mileage.
But the devices she's testing have appealed to big-time planners because they don't use GPS and they provide a limited amount of information, which is periodically downloaded via modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them", said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been serious errors in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive methods of doing this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a fare based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other states are hoping to sell the concept to unsuspecting citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide insurance  pay-to-drive  and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
 Drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them , said a paper on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on paying by mile is just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
A one-off or additional annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much fuel, so that everyone pays his fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin", said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be concerned about protecting their privacy and a whole bunch of other things.
David Bowie: four new songs in the air
The English musician hasn't finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, which appeared in January, he has created a deluxe reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already surfaced on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone shocked.
On his 66th birthday, 8 January 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After a decade of silence (the last record, Reality, was released in 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to shine on the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his pocket with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke is planning to re-release the album on November 4.
He's got a real feast for his fans.
The reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, and a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie has actually done a video presentation of this beautiful box.
He included not only the recordings but also the accessories that came with them: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, most importantly, it gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a skillfully mastered rock electricity.
Newly Published
But Atomica isn't the only title to reveal its charm.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available online.
The Informer is a double-sided: a disturbing intro before a light-hearted cavalcade that slowly slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he has no feet on the ground.
Space Oddity next door was much worse.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie again refers to his weirdness: Did he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs are so mesmerizing, you want to leave Earth.
Bowie is having fun playing chameleon with these titles: turn-based informant, man on a rocket, martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, playing different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the Louis Vuitton campaign photograph The Invitation to Travel, whose new face he embodies.
He will appear in one of their commercials, which will air from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily discharged from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and the NDP in the House of Commons, Mr Nicholson assured that before their release, the military members were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers are receiving proper treatment to return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of saving money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the army's "universal service" rule requiring personnel to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including one of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London, Ontario, reservist with post-traumatic stress disorder, was discharged from the army despite his request to stay another year so he could receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he was pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of universal service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultations, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready", he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under current rules, soldiers who are seriously injured have up to three years to recover.
If they don't meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced out of the military.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to qualify for retirement benefits.
Liberal veteran spokesman Jim Karygiannis called for Corporal Hawkins' reinstatement on Wednesday, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice".
Disney is on the tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favor tablets over its own TV channels for the forthcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available starting November 24th on the website watchdisneyjunior.com or via its mobile and tablet app.
Its worldwide launch on Disney Group channels is not scheduled until 2014, details the statement from its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, aimed at children ages 2 to 7, tells the adventures of Callie, the cat sheriff of a town in the American West, where she maintains order with a magic lasso.
Each episode consists of two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today", said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are becoming increasingly important", he added.
A survey released earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under the age of 2 have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under the age of 8, compared with 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the American intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he is granted asylum, on Thursday to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said:  Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations that are impossible to defend against. 
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online:  If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will make sure that is possible. 
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained following complaints that the NSA had tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of parliament who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign intelligence, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States, it should be taken.
Mr Ströbele, a German Green MP, posted a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he should be assured that he would be safe there, the MP said.
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" campaign of persecution which had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to  my act of political expression .
Citizens around the world and senior officials  including in the United States  felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of continuous surveillance was in the public interest.
The letter offers cooperation with the German authorities  once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved .
Cogeco Cable may soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the on-demand video service Netflix via their TVs in a future that doesn't seem so far away.
The Cogeco subsidiary said Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary beta testing of the platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces and more options", Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in the footsteps of competitors such as Bell, although the Cogeco subsidiary has not yet specified a date for this new platform.
"You have to adapt and change or resist change and fail", Audet stressed.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools to which our customers do not have access at present.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it might offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in talks with some major cable companies to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper Government in its Speech from the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wishes to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the option of paying for the services on the card.
"We have been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large packages of channels does not work", said Mr Audet.
It hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"A new kind of framework will have to emerge from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television", said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43,8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is down from net income of 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, in the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the US-based cable distributor Atlantic Broadband in 2012 for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition by the company after the failed acquisition in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet service provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
Cogeco's revenue grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, in the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable's revenues, however, increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cables customers increased to 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating like this.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very intense competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been found in cans of beef products sold by two small British retailers at low prices, the Food Safety Authority said today.
Routine tests revealed that products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained between 1 and 5% horse DNA.
"Because horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredients list, it should not have been in the product", the agency explained.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the opposite direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal by 6:00 on Friday.
Frontier Airlines is considering charging for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines is considering charging up to $100 to passengers who carry hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it said passengers could take the unopened can with them when they disembark the plane.
The new carry-on charges are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so the small bags under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was intended to encourage travelers to pay the fee in advance.
 We don't want to pay this price , she explained.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as much as they could into the carry-on bags stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in these compartments.
These charges are a way of ensuring that passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees won't really be used to raise money.
The aim is to make Frontier's most loyal customers aware that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate might carry a bag for free, while the next person in line might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know about these fees before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier's hand baggage charges will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other costs, but airlines love them.
They consider that the costs of luggage handling are high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not cover the cost of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage fees three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline charging such fees is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on baggage costs were $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate at the time passengers would discover the airline's unusual hand baggage charges.
 I had never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career , he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added,  passengers boarded at lightning speed .
Frontier also does Spirit and charges a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Border said passengers who take soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
She'll always give out free water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008 but backtracked seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed suit.
The decision by Frontier to charge for carry-on baggage where passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to entice customers to visit its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for every ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it started offering only half-mile loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
So a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal following in her hometown of Denver, but her business is down and she's losing money.
Revenues fell 9 percent and its flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to fix Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA blames an internal error, not hackers for the downfall of its website.
The shadowy National Security Agency said Friday that it was a bug that caused its public website to go down for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update, the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service (DSD) attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and some users still can't access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not compromised at all.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed responsibility for the NSA website being downed by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks are designed to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly top-secret NSA, once nicknamed the  No Such Agency , has come under the spotlight and been heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs at home and abroad  which are part of the secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disgruntled former NSA consultant Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has led to much speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta Downtown now closed
The Delta Hotel Centre-Ville closed its doors in Montreal on Thursday after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who are going to turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on the spot, we met with the employees individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months", explains Delta Hotels' regional director of labour relations, Félix Bisson.
The closing of the Delta is taking place in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to keep it operating, so there was investment of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened", explains Paul Arsenault, Transat Tourism Chair at the School of Management Sciences at UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become a senior residence.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be completed within two years.
For the CEO of Titan, "the project to buy Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employees"
After having thrown in the towel in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in Amiens-Nord, which had promised to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of the American tyre manufacturer Titan, is now ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 at the plant.
The Minister for Productive Recovery, Arnaud Montebourg, had already announced this on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the plant's purchase in January, you're back today.
You had made violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-called workers" who "work three hours" a day, about "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turn of events.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg ?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save some of the highest-paying industrial jobs.
If I hurt anyone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of taxation and unemployment too.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours is handicapping France.
In India, China and many other countries, people work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudice against France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located, and has room to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But with the right price and skilled workers, it's worth a shot.
What kind of deal do you expect between CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered workers a good severance package, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's say Titan buys Goodyear the plant that's closed.
So Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
Now, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from among the approximately 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he can try to get the CGT to sit down with Goodyear.
The first step is for CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
There will be no more workers in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Can you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance payments.
If all the employees agree, the project to buy the factory starts with zero employees.
How can we guarantee the duration of employment when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr Montebourg can get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit down as aircraft deliveries and orders fall
Bombardier Inc., the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer, reported a 15% fall in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from falling orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not provided flight test data for its newest CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule for commercial service before next September.
After the test aircraft's maiden flight about a month and a half ago, it has flown only three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results did not live up to expectations and the stock price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from  overperformance  to  sector performance  due to the low upside potential of the stock market in the next quarter or two.
 Although the drop in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division , said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We expect Bombardier to take new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test programme progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and first flew in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest so far at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is put into commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was moving ahead according to schedule.
 The test aircraft did not stay on the ground for longer than planned , Mr Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the downtime of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to make a first flight and to schedule a period of updating, and that is what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the others to follow shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer will be able to fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was evaluating the timetable for entry into service and would provide further information in the coming months.
 This slow pace of flight testing  although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal timetable  reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed to the first quarter of 2015 , said Mr Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended 30 September, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts were expecting earnings of 10 cents a share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, compared with 57 a year earlier.
Net orders have fallen to 26 aircraft, down from 83 previously.
The deficit in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion at 30 September, unchanged from 31 December of the previous year.
 In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing , said Mr Beaudoin.
Revenues from the aeronautical industry fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that revenues from this division had risen by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The order book for the Transport division totalled $32.6 billion at 30 September, a slight increase compared with 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division suffered from implementation problems in respect of some major contracts.
Executives announced that further guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc., would sit on the board, dropped 8.5 percent to $4.83 on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10 percent drop in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23 and 27 year old speleologists had been missing in a ditch under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, the Isère's Spéléo secours learned on Friday.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced in the field and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday at about 9:30 p.m. to cross the Dent de Crolles, located in the town of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We haven't heard from them since, the same source said.
"The cavers should have come out around 5 a.m"., said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser at the Spéléo secours in charge of organizing the relief effort.
Dozens of people on the scene
About 20 first responders, 10 French emergency personnel, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
By late Friday afternoon, the two cavers had been located.
"A group of other cavers, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information on to one of the rescue teams involved in the network", explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers from the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Fighters were found "tired but uninjured".
They got lost in the network, turned around while waiting for rescue, the prefecture said.
Once they're fed, they should be able to come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists told to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalists' Union on Thursday urged its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services following new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messengers until further notice", it said in a statement.
It calls "scandalous" the Washington Post reports that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating the international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The investigations of journalists are as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them", added Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
The European Parliament has called for the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Union's common agricultural policy.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched a test project in central Brussels on Thursday to repaint 16 signpost lights in the region with the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both to 'increase security' and 'Brussels identity'.
The idea is to paint all the Brussels traffic lights over at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamandising" the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with foolishly spending Brussels' money on repainting signpost posts in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her Flemish-style operations in the capital", said Mr De Bock in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted the Brussels poles herself in dark yellow-blue.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
The people of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who is herself implementing the NVA programme.
It's time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2 245 votes, or 0.5% of the population of Brussels!" concludes Mr De Bock.
The bridge of Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The Pont-de-Buis ecotaxe portico, around which a violent protest against the tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Crane vehicles arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the highway was diverted in the process.
The decision to dismantle the building, announced by the Finistère prefecture on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, the operator of the portico.
It is the last of three working eco-portals in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
The launch of an accessories shop for Google Glass
An online store offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass has just been made available to thousands of developers who own a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They may also purchase a headset, a charger or a storage case.
This store, strictly for developers who already have Google Glass, offers a few accessories like a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
A micro-fibre protective cover or an intra-ear headset can also be purchased for the same price.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with correction lenses, no date for large-scale commercialisation has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father vanished from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid I'd forget him, or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep "hanging out" with him.
There is no recipe, no recipe, no recipe for how to get past the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch, which never leaves me, laid on the nightstand.
It's the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after a grueling battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her empty, cramped on that hospital bed with the sheets wrinkled.
Similarly, his funeral was a cold farewell centered around the dim light of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she'd gone.
Gradually, in small apparitions by day or by night, a little shy, a little erased, she soon returned to my mind, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that was thought to be mourning.
And then she would reveal herself to me, revealing facets of myself that I hadn't yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I was, full and whole.
This detour of my life's path remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that the people we love never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out".
I've always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he was with me when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I was in pain...
He would talk to me, encourage me all the time, he would live in my body.
I could see his hands when I looked at mine, I would lend him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I got to have a life of my own.
He left me my privacy.
It went on for a long time, and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comforting and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, counseled.
I don't remember who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are gone but I feel them constantly near me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I dream about them all the time, maybe not every night but several times a week I'm sure.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it's too late, only, there's always something that keeps me from achieving that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams take me back and they become part of my story and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The night before I had my ultrasound, where I was supposed to know the sex of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up, I got out of bed, my dad was waiting for me on the curb, and he was smiling and happy that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to show me that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I enjoy sharing this shared memory of his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year before, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
I mean, the shock that his disappearance caused to the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my grief pretty quickly, though.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in difficulty or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and becoming interested in the Middle East, to the point of getting a master's degree at a top school, was not, in retrospect, an easy choice.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic as a child, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are still there, so I sometimes think about what she would want me to do at a certain point.
So I try to be as generous and upright as a devout believer.
Now I feel her as a daily presence, a caring soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes landing on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Died after talking to me on the phone.
I've been through all the stages: misunderstanding, anger, pain, self-triggered tears, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, at incongruous times.
Then the weather calmed the pain.
All that remained was the longing, the unanswered emptiness, the need for her to confide in me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet she's there, silent presence, she's there and she's looking at me.
Every morning I see his worried eyes falling on me, I see the dark eyes that weigh his eyes, the wrinkles around the lips that dig up cigarettes, the folds that mark the forehead in the days of worry.
My mother has taken possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I look away.
My wife and mother of three children died of cancer at 43.
We feel his protection all the time, nothing serious can happen to us.
That was his promise on his pain bed, so we gradually learned to smile, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the dead of night when the absence hurts too much, she comes to my dreams when the mood is a little off.
We feel supported and protected in difficult times, and looking back makes us realize how much she was conducting, and we try to stay on the path she set for us.
If someone loved you very much, the absence cannot erase them from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos-related cancer.
I was very close to him, and I always did what he thought or liked.
I couldn't be at his funeral, and three weeks after he died, I gave birth to a little boy.
Even if my beliefs are sometimes different from his, I still wonder if my actions are in harmony with his view of things.
I've had problems in my work because of these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go the other way, I don't sleep about it and I always wonder what he'll think.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
Anyway, he'll always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter ego, there was no need to talk between us.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
Almost 30 years ago, my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense pain that overwhelmed me then has of course eased, but he is still close to me.
Very often it "bursts" into my dreams in such a precise, vivid way that when I wake up I am even more sad to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, and I said no, and he said, "I'm coming down", but in a voice so real that I woke up in a panic, anxious, and I lit the nightlight and looked around, convinced that he was coming.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
I can feel his presence in every room and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we've been happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58, I've lived alone since he left, he's the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I'm a sociable person with a responsible job, I laugh and sing, I go out, I'm a grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication is on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We are not telling the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it", al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what's happening in Iraq isn't resolved, it's going to spread, and what's happening in Syria is going to spread, too.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held up signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with aid.
Cocaine lawyer who informed drug sponsor of police investigation jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction would be exposed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Court of Appeal.
A prominent defense attorney, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was providing sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug-related activities after he compromised himself because of his cocaine habit.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed  Bash  and considered by criminals to be a  case of first importance , was arrested at his home in 2011 following police eavesdropping operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug-related trial.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bar Council dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a  regular user  of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he unlawfully sought information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later jailed with 32 other men after police seized £1.5m worth of heroin and cocaine, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today in Liverpool Magistrates Court, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, fell from grace after being found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted to possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators tracked down the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing the drug, 60 percent pure, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the filing, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner party at Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drugs, and they called each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular user of cocaine after tests showed traces of the class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, claiming that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a  legal privilege .
During his arrest, Ditta collected his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at home and at work and that he was sometimes called to his home by clients for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he called major drug dealers, including some he represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators knew about it.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know not to break the law, it is a criminal lawyer".
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney, and of getting too involved with private clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But it went well beyond the ordinary boundaries of a lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta has not honoured his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal activity and stated:  If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately. 
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta went from criminal lawyer to criminal himself the moment he started procuring drugs from criminal organisations".
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the machinations of leading members of organized crime groups who commissioned him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of public trust.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was found guilty of all three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other traffickers were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta hosted a Q&A session about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali, and inequality would be what motivated him to work.
Aretha Franklin is back on stage in December.
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the MotorCity Casino's Sound Board.
Ms. Franklin is busy in November recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying what she was suffering from, the popular Respect performer told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back".
Menton cuts the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometres of shoreline covered in a coat of light: the heat stroke in Menton could be covered with the bill for the lighting.
This is a fact which, unlike many municipalities, is also paid for by the taxpayers, not by the trade associations.
To reduce costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
There was a shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
Local police say there were at least two injuries.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident is believed to have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Passengers and crew rushed to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Soon the police force intervened and a suspected shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, the school clientele will be targeted, an initiative which had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five sketches, created and performed by local artists, and with a strong dose of humor, the group allows teenagers to learn classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Royal Lyric Society will return with their Lyric Destinations, a format that now fills the pulp mill in Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will be held in the summer of 2014, giving the opportunity to local artists to show what they are capable of.
The event was followed by the "Apero lyrique", a benefit concert held last August with the participation of the soprano Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a charity activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the nonprofit produce a financial statement that is as sweet to the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without giving any specific figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press conference held yesterday in Chicoutimi to reassure himself.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future looks bright, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent supports.
"The finances are on the way and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operation, a milestone we will reach in seven years", the administrator commented.
"I would say even more", added the Director-General, Hélène Gaudreault, with a smile.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Surrey's Gabrielle Roy School faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was charged with hostage taking, sequestering, making threats, carrying a weapon with dangerous intent, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident", said Corporal Bert Paquet in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will appear in court on Friday.
Another class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action lawsuit was filed against the Holy Cross brothers, alleging sexual assault that took place this time at the St. Joseph's oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as 'J.J.' who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the St. Joseph's Oratory, where he served as a chaplain and where his father worked as a painter.
The first action was against only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people said to us: "I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends victims in both actions.
The special feature of the class action that has just been filed is that it allows the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse may have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.
At present, the appeal is gathering the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers.
The facts alleged are generally older than those mentioned in the first action, since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal further points out that the Congregation of Holy Cross and the separate St. Joseph's oratory "allow sexual abuse of children", "exert moral, religious and psychological pressure on victims", "know about the sexual abuse and yet suppress it", and "knowingly and consciously choose to ignore the problem".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the brothers' lawyer, Mr. Émile Perrin, in the 1990's, as well as on archival research on the subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of the Holy Cross who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once the Court has ruled that the case is admissible, the second stage, the hearing on the merits, is held.
In the first appeal, the Congregation of Holy Cross had agreed to settle the matter amicably before any hearings were held on the merits.
Major fire in a shop
A fire severely damaged a store in the LaSalle district of Montreal on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Emergency responders were called at about 1:00 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The 30 firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took almost an hour to bring the blaze under control.
The fire "caused significant damage to the building's structure", said Montreal Fire Safety Department operations chief Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
No one was injured, but about 20 apartments on the first and second floors of the commercial complex had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments may need to be temporarily housed, the SIM said.
There's a lot of opposition to medically assisted dying at the Palliative Care Congress.
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes just days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Quebec Medical Assistance to Die Bill.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their lives, says Maryse Bouvette, spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association.
If we focused on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry worries about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life?" she lamented.
The majority of hospice care will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice president of the Alliance of Hospice Care Homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Mrs Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me a shot".
The director of the Palliative Care Association of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is confusing the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario will follow suit.
The Liberal MP for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the concept of end of life will have to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
 It is a scary country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: what will stop Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow? , the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
 This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it , explained Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group  owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya.
He said the new media court  will always be biased as it is an extension of the government  and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians", he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have  control over the media . The Standard, meanwhile, said that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya  had suffered a severe blow  and lashed out at the bill as  draconian .
The passage of the bill comes as a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media has provoked the wrath of the authorities by broadcasting video surveillance footage of troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly robbing the luxury shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a media crackdown.
Under the new bill, media outlets could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the added risk of being  removed  or unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, even a single fine is enough to shut down most FM stations.
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's  lively  blogosphere.
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
 No one will ever know , wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Left to their own devices, politicians would bankrupt the country and return us to hunting and gathering.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their booming monthly tax-free salaries of around 532,000 shillings, which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused quite a stir at the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave and short-term departures, the pharmacy department was severely short on staff.
The report also highlights the need for a more efficient and effective system of public procurement.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire freelance workers, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
The problem is that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of aid.
We've streamlined or reduced some of our activities inside the facility to level the playing field as things get better.
We've certainly worked hard to get our young [pharmacy residents] interested in coming and staying here.
There's a coincidence that got us into a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 looks much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three more pharmacists have been hired in the last few months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain students have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence at Laval have also decided to remain in the CSSS.
Now it's much better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the fiscal year, we'll have seven new pharmacists and three returns from maternity leave.
This will therefore complement our work from last year.
The need for more
The situation is still delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of employees] is always precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ many young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always have three maternity leave when things are going well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more of them and we don't have pharmacists who are available to do replacements, so it was harder.

And there is a certain risk involved: the girl who hadn't hesitated to pose naked on ice-paper will be shown in much sulfuric situations on the big screen.
A clip from Nymphomaniac has hit the web, with Stacy Martin in bed and in a trance with Shia LaBeouf.
While the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty away, he used X-professionals for the boldest sex scenes, before digitally merging all the bodies: above the belt is the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses into their final stretches, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished getting her story out.
A Narbonne CGR room evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first screening of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, following the tingling in the throats felt by the audience.
Immediately, the headmaster evacuated the hall and alerted the fire department to a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a full recon of the room yielded nothing.
Bad joke against the backdrop of tear gas?
Or an accident ?
Still, the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers to the core.
The room was aired and everything was back in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers were able to enjoy the pictures again.
On screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kilos of cocaine in pumpkins
On Halloween morning, a woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine into the country, hidden in pumpkins, at Montreal Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drugs were detected.
The cocaine was distributed in three pumpkins that had been emptied.
The drugs were then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
It's part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, spokeswoman for the CBSA.
All I can tell you is that she was coming home.
Since the beginning of 2013, border agents at Montreal Trudeau Airport have seized 173 drugs, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border guards in the Quebec region seized a total of 1,653 drugs.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese military, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new raid by the IDF air force on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under almost identical circumstances to the one that took place on July 5: at the time, an unnamed US official also confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-to-surface missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials have not hidden their anger at Washington's disclosure of the attack, which could force President Assad to react.
Ukraine is nearing bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, casting doubt on the former Soviet republic's ability to meet its financial obligations after more than a year of recession.
The country's government debt rating is now 'B-', falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least a one in three chance that it will be lowered again within a year.
"The government's strategy is becoming less likely to guarantee sufficient foreign exchange to meet its high external financing needs", says the agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects that the trend will continue.
This makes it difficult to repay loans taken abroad.
The agency considers that devaluation is increasingly likely, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to pay for its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government at a time of heightened tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious over Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was released after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, which is still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, which has a budget deficit, has been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund for months, which granted it a loan of $15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far only released $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new installments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including raising gas prices for the population.
After another unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF this week found that "the large external financing needs" were "a vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, according to economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Policy Studies, "an improvement in the short term cannot be expected".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", the expert said, as presidential elections are scheduled for 2015.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" surrounding the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels makes conditional on the release of opposition candidate Yulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be good for trade in the long term but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium term related to Russia's reaction", explained S&P, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that if a free trade area is created between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
The US green light for the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objections from U.S. authorities to their merger, bringing them closer to creating the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended", both groups said in a statement.
They also said that they had obtained the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of both groups", they add.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would pursue the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
M23 appears to be on the verge of defeat after being driven from the areas in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it has controlled since the beginning of the insurgency 20 months ago.
"We will pursue M23 and accuse them wherever they hide because they are criminals", FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not allow them to reorganise themselves because they have tortured the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to restore peace.
M23 officials explained that they evacuated the villages under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not change his demands for peace talks.
According to the Ugandan mediators, the fighting resumed in Kampala on Wednesday between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
There are reports of clashes in the hills overlooking Bunagana, the last rebel-held town to fall this week, and around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was born in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison's flight and the inaction of the MONUSCO Blue Helmets.
The fall of Goma led the UN Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid response brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
The FARDC staff was reorganized and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of government troop advancement is unprecedented today.
"M23 seems to be coming to an end", predicts Congolese affairs expert Jason Stearns on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which vehemently denies this, of providing military support to the M23, which was originally formed by former Congolese soldiers who rebelled.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali had raised the possibility of military retaliation following shells dropped on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, Bunagana residents filled the streets of the village to welcome the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with M23 for a year and it seemed unthinkable that we would ever be liberated by the army", says one resident of this neighbouring village in Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (from M23), we are traumatized", the man added.
Tests performed by the Pasteur Institute on a suspected coronavirus patient have turned negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of having the disease, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest oil company in the United States, reported a fall in its quarterly profit on Friday due to falling refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased but fell short of the group's targets.
Its third-quarter net profit decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters were expecting an average earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpd for this year, with a 25% growth in production expected by 2017.
The bulk of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditure has increased by $7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a falling net profit on Thursday, despite an increase in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint is admissible
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (SRSB) has been charging since the beginning of the school year a fee of $150 per pupil (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for pupils who benefit from two-way school transport, a service which the organisation offers when it is able to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
"There is a mediation service that is offered by the commission and I was interested", explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to the Commission, the CSRS was invited to mediate and requested additional time to reflect on the matter.
"It is always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions", says Ms. Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke Regional School Board (SRSB) declined to comment.
The organisation only meant that mediation is part of the process when a complaint is made.
Imbroglio over the closure of the emergency room at the Hôtel-Dieu
In the face of the ongoing backlash from some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "delay the timetable for implementing the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergency departments which will not be able to intervene on 4 November".
This was an official request "to avoid any risk of emergency care in Paris at the beginning of winter", but also to avoid interfering with the PS's campaign a few months away from the municipal elections.
Despite the ministerial directives, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although, at the AHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
From 4 November, the firefighters - who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency room visits at the Hôtel-Dieu - will all have been instructed to take 30 serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, the emergency room will be open Monday for five general medicine interns.
As for the transfer of the internal medicine beds, it's scheduled for later this month.
"The emergency room at the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4", says Loïc Capron, president of the APHP's medical commission (CME), which supports the project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means", confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to receive patients in emergency situations", he said, pointing out that SMUR vehicles are always on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on site, he added.
But it's up to the A.R.S. to decide whether to close the emergency room.
"Things are being done gradually", says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, who said that on November 4 "there will be no change in terms of service provided".
"The minister lied to us or was lied to", lamented emergency physician Gérald Kierzek.
He was dismissed from his post as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the sling against the reorganisation project, and he describes himself as a "warning man" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and suffocating emergency rooms that were renovated less than five years ago", he said.
He said that "if the other emergency departments in Paris could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem".
But they're constantly overcrowded.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at the Lariboisière emergency room.
The ARS argues that 30 patients "dispatched" to several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency departments, whose human resources will have been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are defending the "new hospital model" which has been in place since 7 October and which is expected to continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to be involved in the establishment of a 'permanent outpatient care'.
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose", asks Gérald Kierzek, who considers "the concept of a non-serious emergency" to be "dangerous" and a "medical regression".
It's going to be like Level 3 maternity wards.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where the best care is available.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, Paris UMP councillor and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
The PS candidate Anne Hidalgo, meanwhile, again recalled on France Inter on Monday morning that she had spoken in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If it did, it would be a clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, the spokesman for the Commission.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu is legitimate on the merits, we cannot accept it without an acceptable schedule for deferral to other hospitals.
Obama ends the wiretapping of the IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop eavesdropping on the International Monetary Fund and World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to re-engage in the NSA wiretapping case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and World Bank have been mentioned as being under surveillance by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
When asked about the issue, a U.S. government official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington".
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been implemented in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered the practice to stop in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the termination of the wiretapping at the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of such information.
UN welcomes new targets for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set 12 years ago to fight global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in putting forward the  Sustainable Development Goals  to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that now was the time to put national interests ahead of the game.
 I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs) , he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals which is built on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are rising as conflicts break out between powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, crowds of thousands gathered in central Maputo to chant peaceful slogans in a rare public demonstration.
 We want peace to return; we want stability , said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Worried about her country's future, she traded her work clothes for a t-shirt with the Portuguese inscription  we want security  before joining the crowd gathered on the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, supported initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement was signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and local residents.
The stakes are high for the growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the North West could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and the US' Anadarko.
The Frelimo party, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo deny each other responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government is behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The assaults on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for starting the conflict, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
'We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,' said Mr Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have failed to ease tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
 They are two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are always fighting , explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them are good negotiators and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and war treasure from the government.
The share of votes won by Renamo has been steadily declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza  who is due to step down at the end of his second term next year  wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
 He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , said Mr Mazanga.
It's not known exactly what the Renamo's capability is, but it has conducted disruptive lightning strikes on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the accidents took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique, said Mr Mazanga.
The instability has added to the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
 People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is up to the latter to find solutions to the problems , he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only want stability.
 Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to roads , he added.
"Myths and legends should be taught to children as models of lifestyle", says the author.
The legend of Thor might show that brute force does not weigh in the face of subtle cunning, while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be  far too violent, far too scandalous and in some cases far too obscene to be taught in school , Crossley-Holland advocated a  careful selection  of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are  openly didactic  makes children  completely unplug , the messages being  sublimated  in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said:  You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight. 
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it needs to be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
One fighter from the Hamas armed wing was killed and another wounded by Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip tonight, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot by an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA spying: US has "gone too far", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, Secretary of State John Kerry has admitted, in this first admission from Washington in the midst of a controversy with Europe over the massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted to controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I'll concede to you, as the president did, some of these actions have gone too far and we're going to make sure that doesn't happen again in the future", John Kerry said at a conference in London, which he attended from Washington on Thursday, Oct. 31.
In his speech, which was broadcast in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the US chief of state at length justified intelligence and intelligence-gathering practices by the need to combat terrorism and prevent possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Madrid attacks of March 2004 and the London attacks of July 2005, John Kerry said that the US authorities had since thwarted many terrorist attacks through interception of communications and intelligence gathering.
"We have actually prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding and people from being killed, because we were able to know about these plans in advance", the US diplomat argued.
And, John Kerry told the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived".
But we're trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far in an inappropriate way", admitted the Secretary of State, who had already spoken out on the international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday evening that President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels deceived".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to flare up this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, citing documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program called "MUSCULAR", run with the NSA's British counterpart, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by the internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected in the last month of January alone - ranging from e-mail metadata to text items or audio and video documents.
These intercepts would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have reported that the NSA has intercepted massive amounts of data and communications from US allies and leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
In the face of the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the US president was unaware of such eavesdropping, Barack Obama refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.
But the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had intercepted tens of millions of communications of European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to European intelligence agencies who would have seized those communications, before handing them over to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and would not be aimed at Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also provoked the ire of China.
Paris Saint-Germain will host Lorient on Friday without its top asset, the injured Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
PSG, who are ahead of Monaco in the league by goals, have released the list of players selected for the 12th day of the match, but the 32-year-old striker is not included.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from a left knee inflammation when he returned to the team earlier this month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated dead
The crematorium of Père Lachaise holds a secular ceremony at 11 a.m. in memory of all the cremated victims of the crematorium during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist candidate for mayor of Paris, is due to attend and will then explain her proposals for a funeral at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation rather than burial: 53 percent, according to an Ipsos survey of 1,009 people on September 6 and 7, instead of 47 percent.
For the funeral of a loved one, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they're unlucky enough to lose a child, only 15% of them choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, philosopher Damien Le Guay, vice-chairman of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, emphasizes the "violence" of cremation for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence to the body of the loved one", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is the "de-identification of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new phenomenon", answers Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Pathology and author of Apprivoiser la mort.
It has been tolerated by the Catholic Church only since 1963, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To make cremation more appropriate, François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, said, it was necessary to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would have a right with an inhumation.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want a marriage for their loved ones, whether it be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now 73% of those who chose cremation wish to have a ceremony.
66% of atheists and non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this change in society.
"For about ten years they have tried to prevent families from the violence of waiting, doing nothing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the delivery of the ashes", observes Michaud-Nérard.
Seventy percent of institutions now offer ceremonial masters, who perform the following rituals in the presence of the body: greeting the assembly, naming the deceased, connecting him with others, evoking him, giving meaning to his death, organizing the farewell.
This has been the case at the crematorium of Père Lachaise since 1998.
The masters of the ceremony are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, the crematorium of Père Lachaise has been organizing, since 2010, on All Saints' Day, several memorial ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of the people who were cremated during the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is being broadcast online for those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium has given us permission to relay it.
In La Seyne, the relocation of rats is controversial
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office, exceptionally and provisionally, proposed to relocate the couple and their three children to a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on an exaggerated dimension, says Joel Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats have always been in cities.
The company makes two crossings a year, and we also take care of every request from the inhabitants.
We have carried out 64 interventions since the end of last winter.
The neighborhood is not deserted, and the city is not overrun with rats.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, de-icing products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, you're not going to kill a kid.
"We didn't invite the rats into our home", says the father who moved out of his apartment to the hotel.
Soon we're penniless and we're waiting for a new place to live, the same price as the old one.
The Tokyo stock market is down 0.88%, news
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended Friday with a fall despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The stock suffered from the fall in the dollar against the yen, which hurt export values and the warning on its annual result released by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index fell by 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57, and the Topix index fell by 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony dropped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house burns down in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters have been dispatched to 9 Hebert Street.
The fire broke out in a three-story house located behind the courtyard of the Quebec City Seminary.
All the tenants were away when the fire broke out.
The fire was brought under control an hour after the firefighters arrived, who were numerous to respond.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they actually saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms came back, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here", explained France Loiselle, a spokeswoman for the Quebec City Fire Department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman , the 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival , is in the New Yorker .
New York City is arguably the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly 100 years ago, vaudeville performer Frank Fay, who served as master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience, in the tone of conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was most recently taken up by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
Most of the headlines emerged in the Carolinas, and were a huge hit, until they became too famous to play in a club, Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of  Stand Up for Heroes , a comedy and music benefit for veterans at Madison Square Garden, which will feature Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The festival has grown, and so has the comedy world.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional tours, such as presenting shows on small TV channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his first appearance on the front stage in a cable sitcom ( The League on the theme of FXX's cheerfully lascivious fantasy football) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young comedians with singular voices (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of this year's festival will be an interview: David Steinberg talking with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called  Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg .
The meeting is at City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He used to tell me that when he was here, sometimes he'd walk down an alley between two buildings and think, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here.
Oil prices continue to fall and are approaching $ 96 a barrel .
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The US benchmark crude price for delivery in December fell by 14 cents to $ 96.24 a barrel late in the morning in Europe during electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8 percent drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector, which came in on Friday, show growth in activity, suggesting an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, following a decline not seen for two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by US refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Texas' right to abortion challenged
A federal appeals court has reinstated in Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary abortion that were blocked by a trial judge this week.
This means that a bill passed in July in that state that broadly challenges the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The Court of Appeal's ruling means that doctors who will perform IVG will have to have a "privilege of admission" from local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his status as a member caring for a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of making a diagnosis or treatment.
The GIV advocates argue that the content of the law could result in the immediate closure of one third of the state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be denied access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge had ruled that the provisions on the privilege of admission were unconstitutional on the eve of the law's entry into force.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to overturn the trial court's decision blocking the law.
A plenary hearing on this matter is scheduled for January.
The New Star has made a strong comeback in terms of viewership, with 1.3 million viewers following its TV station, or 5.6% of viewership.
But was the show on the schedule?
Some 10,000 candidates have come to audition for this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the bad Sinclair, the perennial André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of getting back to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have scored at this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide selection of aspiring singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
But on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, a few have found their way.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone all the way.
Behind the TV screens, the vocations of the successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others just want to make people laugh.
Court blocks a decision on NYPD's search and seizure policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's search and seizure program and dismissed her from the case.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was stayed pending the outcome of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The City appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the Police Department in modifying its policy and associated training program.
The appeals court heard arguments on the stay request on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal held that the judge should be dismissed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for Judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongfully targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their search and seizure program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in the most controlled neighbourhoods.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police check.
The appeal hearing by the City is expected to take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of control and search has been criticized by many civil rights activists.
This system of checks and searches has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest level in history in 2011 with 684,330 checks that mostly involved black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and has turned into a class action.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's surveillance and search program say they will end unfair practices, make police forces more effective and trustworthy, and change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of under pressure police forces after police numbers were drastically reduced over the past decade.
The judge emphasized that it was not ending the checks and searches practices, which are constitutional, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its checks.
Renters have to go to the polls, because each of them pays an average of $100 a month on the rent that goes to the city in taxes.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We're forced to raise rents to help pay the new taxes.
We're sending a clear message by going to the polls.
We need to make a difference in the city.
All the candidates told us they would tackle the outrageous debt.
We can't afford $100,000 fireworks, $4 million to $5 million in land in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say enough is enough.
End of duty for the chef of the Elysée
After working in embassies, the chef entered the 500 square meters of the Elysian Kitchens as a clerk, and rose through the ranks to become a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their holiday resorts, and nurtured countless world leaders in a near-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of his retirement at age 60.
The man with open face, skull and glasses of intellectual, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin is a holder of a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a Sologne castle.
"I've been from one castle to another!" ironically says Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents he served, but also those of their wives and some of their distinguished guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus", he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women from the kitchens of the Elysée!
Despite the displeasure of some heads of state who have shown a relative indifference to earthly food, "they are all gluttonous", says Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
Francois Hollande, who restored cheese, "is a person who loves to eat" and "there is not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific diet request".
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure he had to bear, especially at state dinners at the Élysée: "Between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost blank.
Those people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée, who had a drink with his team, family and friends on Tuesday evening, leaves with a pinch of heart".François Hollande came to greet me".
He said a lot of praise.
"His human side came out", he says.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was set on fire in Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The fire department has issued three alarms to the four-room building at 15 Hébert Street.
The fire started in the front, but it spread to the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokeswoman for the Quebec City Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid response of the firefighters prevented the flames from spreading to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built close together.
The house burned down, and there were four apartments in it, but no tenants were on the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, although water damage was caused.
An investigation is underway to determine the source, but the excavators have ruled out any possibility of foul play.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Release of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese has left out some footage from his upcoming film, the title role of which, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget about being reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to blow your mind in his role as a crazed trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a "Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a massive Wall Street corruption scandal".
In the '80s, Jordan Belfort then runs a scam that will make him a rich man, very rich.
The opportunity to watch his incredible rise, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, man chains the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of every kind are the key words in this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that brought them together on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed because of its long editing.
It seems the movie is actually going to be 2:45.
In theaters on December 25th, he'll be able to participate in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used  phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation  to try to confirm a bogus tip on a liaison involving then-Interior Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with Hannah Pawlby, his "beautiful special counsel".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper had commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, to hack into Pawlby's voice mail and permanently plant her outside his door, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The indictment suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man who stands outside people's houses hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they have to say about it", Edis said.
He said NotW used three means to investigate the subjects: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say  Of course .
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW editorial office when a source, feeling a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said he was told:  Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles. 
A tape, which included pirated voice messages recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer involving Miss Pawlby and her sister in a file called  Projects .
During the period the detective was investigating her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Miss Pawlby's every move and gesture.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said:  I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about. 
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking into the phone.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister amid violence
The US president was due to meet Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking US help in fighting the worst wave of violence in five years.
Iraq had its deadliest month in October in five and a half years, according to figures released by Iraqi authorities on Friday.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN gives an even higher toll with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite heightened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence is raising fears of a new outbreak as neighboring Syria is engulfed in civil war.
Bombs are dropped on markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the streets and even in their homes, and security forces are also frequently targeted.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complain of being politically marginalized and the target of unjust arrests, has fuelled this outbreak of violence.
New violence killed four people in northern Iraq on Friday, a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of bombings, including the bombing of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the Syrian civil war.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al Qaeda.
Violence is the focus of talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American president, elected on the promise of ending military involvement in that country, had painted an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has repeatedly met with the executive and the elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Shiite Nouri Al Maliki, blaming him for the renewed violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policies".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing blames a Uighur group for the Tiananmen attack
China's internal security chief on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists of being behind the car bombing that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The SUV crashed into a crowd in the Chinese capital's famous square, a symbol of the murderous crackdown of 1989, and caught fire, killing three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a minority Turkic-speaking people who settled in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
The Chinese government blames the movement for the frequent outbreaks of violence there, which are fueled by demands for independence.
"The violent terrorist incident that happened in Beijing was planned and premeditated", Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan", he added, quoted by China News Agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and said his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained jars filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42.
The Islamic Movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked participants how priests treat gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national bishops' conference, with instructions to get as many responses as possible.
The information will be used for an important family gathering that Pope Francis plans to hold next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter", an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to investigate parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet, asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: army attacks the last stronghold of the rebels
The M23's unstoppable forces, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at an altitude of nearly 2000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night", a resident of Jomba told AFP, who was contacted by phone around 12:30 p.m. and said that a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the fighting has decreased a bit", he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a bit".
According to the witness, who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "sweeper operation".
The crackling of small arms could be heard very clearly behind him.
From Bunagana, the political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP reporter could hear heavy gunfire.
According to a source at the UN Stabilization Mission in the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase", with the FARDC "encircling the remaining M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, MONUSCO has not directly participated in the fighting, but has provided the government troops with crucial support in intelligence, observation and planning.
By late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were marching toward the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to take over from another vehicle bombing M23 positions in the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday night again called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" or be disarmed "by force", but left open the process in Kampala, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without any results so far.
There, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it is now up to the Ugandan mediation to arrange the signing", said Roger Lumbala, deputy head of the M23 delegation, although this information could not be confirmed immediately by the government.
M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 by former rebels, mostly Tutsis, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its subsoil is rich in coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the return movement to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed at noon.
"This morning we crossed back to go to our fields, but the military told us to retreat", Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back, told AFP.
It feels like the shots are coming closer to the populations.
In the early evening, dozens of local residents crossed the border, some with a mattress over their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, the stage beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, English and French, singing and dancing productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: French musicals are establishing themselves as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre Dame in Paris to Mozart to rock opera, most attempts were caught in ridicule.
And the big hits like Cabaret and Les Misérables were all about mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage­Entertainment in Mogador changed the situation.
Today, both scenes are making headlines as hit singles.
The first is the Christmas of the year, with the excellent My Fair Lady, and the next year, with the worldwide creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could be one of the biggest hits of the season.
On the other stages, musical shows such as "1789", "Bastille Lovers" and short musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are set to the tune of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the landmark book "Histories of Musical Comedies" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the hard-won success.
How are French musical comedies evolving?
The supply has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical shows" which evolve according to the producers' wishes...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story like in 1789, the Bastille Lovers.
Others jump back fifteen years on the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora at the top of the bill.
Then there are the musical comedies with the lavish productions of the Châtelet which bring us back to the golden age of Broadway and discover the world of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes various Anglo-Saxon musical comedies by adapting them into French.
The French independent producers are trying to break through.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "Spring Awakening" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough talented performers like on Broadway singing, acting and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in one season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists working on projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy, it's a whole different story.
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
There are plenty of jobs between regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as important as the number of jobs to fill.
Why are the country tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often the boulevard theatre for adults rather than young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as fleeting stars...
The idea of attracting handsome (often talented) young men to the headliners of a musical show is sure to make the girls and often their entire family fall in love.
The Facebook pages of these shows are expertly maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive at a provincial zenith.
Mayonnaise is made in Paris and eaten by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major theatres in France in the same form as in Paris.
Seriously injured in a ghost driver accident on the Brussels ring
A serious accident occurred on Friday morning at about 5.30am on the Brussels inner ring road near Hoeilaart, on the way to Waterloo.
A woman's car was hit by a ghost driver, who survived.
The ring has been closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the scene of the accident, until the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause any traffic jams as the accident took place at the Hoeilaart exit.
Traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured at a Disneyland Paris attraction
A five-year-old child was seriously injured in an accident at a Disneyland Paris attraction.
His life expectancy is no longer compromised but he's still hospitalized.
At the time of the crash, the boy was with his father on a Pirates of the Caribbean cruise ship.
It's been closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares for a new assault
Children play on a charred tank belonging to M23 rebels in Kibumba, eastern DRC, October 31, 2013.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC, on Friday.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the Bugina hill, which overlooks the Mbuzi hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
All that's left is Runyonyi Hill.
"The Chanzu campaign is not very strategic", the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told AFP.
Mr. Paluku is planning to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
The political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was recaptured by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irreducibles have been cut at nearly 2,000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who reported fighting nearby all day on Thursday said the situation had been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting the previous day and were buried.
A girl was shot and three others were injured, including one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, the witness quoted by AFP added.
Since the resumption of fighting between the FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two warring parties have not reported any loss of life.
NSA revelations are increasing corporate paranoia about state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, his mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reports say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation prompted an exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of US intelligence, again insisted in September that the US is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to  steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits .
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant turned whistleblower, began to uncover his endless treasure trove of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and corporate executives are not sure whether to believe the CEO's word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud storage providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia about state surveillance more than ever.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps for a decade, was the last straw that broke the camel's back.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely corporate executives are also potential targets.
Snowden made it clear how extensively the U.S. intelligence community and corporations are collaborating.
I think it is conceivable that these data could be used in their mutual interest.
 Germany must wake up  says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the US poses as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents released by Mr Snowden, there is nothing to date to indicate that the United States has passed on industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks sufficient computer and internet capabilities and believe that it should work to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Corporate executives are skeptical about this.
A German parliamentarian says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
 This is not the right way to do it , says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Except for the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations came as a shock to some companies who had previously thought China posed the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the United States is regulated under the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10 percent of non-US members abandoned their plans to use a US cloud storage service provider after the revelations about the US data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says:  Our customers are asking us a question today that they didn't ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in that jurisdiction? 
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that therefore this data must be kept at all costs.
It's not surprising that there's economic espionage.
There's always been.
 This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion , says Kurt Bock, managing director of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to disclose the precautions they have put in place, in case this would give an advantage to an adversary.
Big companies have long been hammering the message that it is at least unwise to pick up a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the carmaker Audi, says that the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of compromising the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are then thrown away.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
 SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorised access , warns the BfV in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to economic spying by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States cited France, along with Russia and Israel, as second-highest perpetrators of economic intelligence hacking, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company felt that when it came to economic espionage,  the French were the worst .
Bernard Squarcini, former director of France's domestic intelligence agency, the DCRI, said in an interview this month:  The agencies know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies. 
Parents of a teenager in Georgia who died under unusual circumstances believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found in a wrestling mat in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th, stuck in a pressed rug, standing behind the gymnasium of his high school.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes those conclusions.
They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered, said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's findings.
"They think it defies logic, the laws of physics and common sense", Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were made for the sole purpose of covering up the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
 They sent their son to school with a cartridge and he was returned to them in a body bag , he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'm gonna follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
 I consider that there is sufficient basis  for opening an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of positional asphyxiation.
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
 Several questions still need to be answered or confirmed, he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence of a nature to warrant a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us an opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to turn over all the video surveillance tapes that investigators had reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage would provide clues as to the circumstances of his death.
CDC releases allergy advice for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage food allergies in school children.
This is the first set of guidelines the U.S. government has issued, since the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has skyrocketed.
One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies among children had increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of food allergies in children among teachers and staff, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stockpile of epinephrine  the most commonly used branded EpiPen self-injector  so that they can react quickly in the event of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
The state legislatures recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to stockpile epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say,  I feel like something is pricking my tongue  I feel like I have a hair on my tongue  or  I have tingling on my tongue .
The NSA case highlights the complete absence of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is publicly offended by the fact that it summoned the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand prohibits the Bolivian presidential plane from flying over the territory, on the basis of the rumor that Edward Snowden is on board?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they are reacting to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance of all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde, a few weeks apart, on the one hand, the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the listening of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't that be a little bit of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form his own opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider it to be an important illumination in the eyes of American power.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to indignate us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can we not have American cooperation ?
The introduction of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States and France over the last ten years has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States in particular have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information on an almost daily basis, which are described by both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the means of the NSA.
France, for example, can be led to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the American services, and in return - as has been said very quickly - the Americans can give the French information on other parts of the world.
So the fundamental issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that should be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of the violation of freedoms.
What is the real risk to the United States?
Even if they are denounced, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk for the Americans could be doubled.
The first is when their allies -- and this has been the case recently -- learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have become strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US service providers subject to US laws, and thus to the control of the NSA.
Finally, the wide-ranging movement of revelations by the world's media, which is helping to spark a debate about the previously virtually non-existent practices of intelligence surveillance, could prompt lawmakers, including in the United States, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose  gender undetermined 
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The sex of newborn children will no longer be determined by the sex of the child at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to list an undetermined sex or unspecified sex on the child's birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to relieve the pressure on the shoulders of parents who might make hasty decisions about sex reassignment surgery for their infant, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would say years later,  I am neither a man nor a woman. 
I'll still be the patchwork the doctors created, bruised and scratched.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 babies born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersex being one of the group of 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed sex organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to assign it, and then wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if appropriate.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and an expert on issues of sexual identity, said that the new German law  seems like a good idea .
Intersex children are a moral dilemma.
 Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children , he added.
It's possible to do a sex assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child develops a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their status is not related to gender but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair, breast size and height), primary sex characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sex organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudiced crime.
Young men who are not gender-conforming now have camps that are specifically designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to list male, female or  third gender  on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be declared "neutral" after winning her appeal case which allowed her to keep an unspecified gender for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F  X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still a matter of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this predominantly Catholic country signed a petition to have the  gender theory  removed from schoolbooks.
The American Catholic Online also opposed the German law, writing that  since the world is being dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two more pillars of civilization are being overthrown. 
In Maryland, a mother of an infant also told Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be assigned to babies at birth.
 Parenting is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's gender , she said on the website for new parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the magnificent Greek god of the double sex.
And just a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate, which you could erase and re-draw on.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about his or her gender reassignment when they grow up.
 In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,  Drescher noted.
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was put forward by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is malleable.
He coined the term  sexual identity  and argued that social and environmental signals  how parents raise a child  interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as either male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as  John/Joan , his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut during a botched circumcision to have him castrated completely, including the removal of his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
 Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it was not , said Drescher.
At about 15 years of age, he became a young man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors still repeat this pattern.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex-change operations say they are not satisfied with the outcome.
That is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors couldn't really tell whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a satisfying life as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of his external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he had a vaginal operation.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, underwent testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him infertile.
Today, he's a spokesperson for others at an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law  calls for labeling and stigmatization .
 Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child a "undetermined" sex, she said. 
We're afraid it's going to encourage the intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female, and wait.
But we haven't seen what the law is going to provide, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports the Australian law as it allows adults to choose to be recognised as the third sex.
 Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender, she added.
The German law concerns the allocation of sex at birth.
It's not a battle that young children should be fighting at that age.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammography radiologist in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands in a support group, said the German law will hold both parents and children accountable.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because of the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie has developed feminine characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to have children through adoption or surrogacy.
 The law leaves some latitude for parents so they don't have to make hasty decisions , said Baratz.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time to register either  male  or  female .
So, everything is fine  you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and you're enjoying the joy of being a parent.
You don't have to rush into an irreversible surgery.
 This puts the children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing, she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with and that is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes his government will last until 2015 despite the strong left-right tensions within the ruling coalition as the Senate vote to remove Silvio Berlusconi from office approaches.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he had "firm intention" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former Council president convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, declares his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as was demonstrated on 2 October by his refusal to yield to the orders of Berlusconi, who already wanted to topple the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a TSA agent and a suspect were injured in the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called to the scene of the disaster said they had responded to a call for "multiple injuries".
"Law enforcement is on the ground", the airport said on its Twitter account, while TV images showed people being evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting", a spokesman for the US Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
Local ABC showed one person being evacuated on a stretcher, and a second being transported in a wheelchair.
The incident occurred at around 9:30 local time (12:30 GMT in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that terminals two and three are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was not immediately able to confirm whether any of its employees were injured.
All flights arriving and departing from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas militant and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip on Thursday, health services sources later learned.
A Hamas source said fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army only mentioned a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel that the Jewish state has described as "terrorist" and that was dug at the border and announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign is seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have been considering, in the greatest secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in the much-anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann,  Double Down: Game Change 2012 .
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's close associates had conducted  deep group work and polls in late 2011  to see if Biden's ouster could help Obama in his re-election bid as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice President by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the Chicago campaign headquarters and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's close advisers - including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that change was under consideration.
Double Down indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their close personal ties, before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and this was one of them", Daley told the paper.
Remember at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were like,  Lord, what can we do? 
While Daley called the review "concerted", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily in finding out whether the change would be beneficial in the election.
 Campaigns don't spend much money on polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking action , Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama was aware that his team was considering a replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of the possible change, the former secretary general admitted it was possible that Obama knew.
Martin added that Double Down did not answer definitively the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know that Biden's removal from the presidential list was under consideration.
"Maybe", said Martin.
Would you like some fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first fluorescent jellyfish ice cream.
Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it glow.
Chris explains that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat from your mouth, the more you lick it, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the Lick Me I'm Delicious ice cream company, said: "It's an amazing thing, but we're still in the early stages of production, and 2g of this stuff costs about £200".
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level goes up and the ice starts to glow.
We've been testing it for the past few months, and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone around Halloween because it gives an extraordinary glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever made because the glow of jellyfish is worth four times as much as gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
The Bristol-based company Charlie's Experimental approach is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added:  I really want to develop an invisible ice cream. 
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session.
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the East Hampton Star to residents of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st Tai Chi movement with his musician's hands splitting the air", writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also said that the week before his death, she had promised her husband that she would take him out of the hospital and to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here over the years.
And even though we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many the tremendous joy of living he had", she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: What It Is
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late, and dress up to go out in the neighborhood.
Today I'm more depressed.
I haven't given out a single candy in the last two years, and I certainly won't this year.
But the stats show I'm the bad sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them - will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is the trends.
Disguises are expected to account for $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sex objects are the rage.
Women don't need to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most searched disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's okay to stay traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year, and to my surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed up as hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't get a glitch.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 272 million pounds of Hershey bars, lollipops, milk duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
That's great news for the 41 million kids who go candy-hunting in their neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, not tell each other stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate on Halloween.
Corn candy is the one thing we don't want to eat, and yet nearly 10 million pounds of it is sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That's about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like Terror Behind the Walls, Howl-O-Scream, and The House of Shock.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you pissing on yourself that your friends post on Facebook and you can't take them off and that some guy you like leaves a comment like " pretty head".
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and sculpting a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree -- it's something we've done since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the pumpkin baby trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pots and didn't have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkins that are slowly withering on your porch probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more attention, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922-pound pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will set up an internal 'bad bank' structure with £38 billion (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, in order to relax its relationship with London and to accelerate its re-privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleared it within three years.
RBS also said that it would write an additional provision for impairment of non-performing loans of £4 to £4.5 billion in the quarter, a write-down linked to the constitution of the cantonal structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up between GBP 10 and 11 billion of capital, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The Bank and London stressed that the 'bad bank' would be a way to put an end to the past, as the government was particularly accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, focus on the future and the 90 per cent of assets that make up a really good bank and build a great bank for the customers and for the UK", new chief executive Ross McEwan told reporters.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, the CEO of Bowler Motorsport said:  The rally fans who join Bowler have changed. 
Not all are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are very pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are confident that it will be a new way of trying out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and of preparing for the rigors and realities of racing.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle  the championship is going to be really exciting 
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after he got stuck 50 feet above the ground on an unstable ledge in a quarry.
Ruby, a Spanish cocker, had escaped after a non-gravity car accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog trapped in the quarry.
Firefighters are down the cliff in a flash to get the bitch and save her from certain death.
A puppy was lucky to escape the worst after firefighters were called to rescue him from a shaky cliff 15 metres above the ground.
Ruby, a nine-month-old Spanish cocker, escaped after a traffic accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and her girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and made a call on social media after she disappeared in the quarry following a minor accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sighted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, stuck 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and came down as a wake-up call to rescue Ruby by using a pet stretcher to transport her up the cliff.
Technical emergency specialist Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation".
It was right in the middle of the cliff, 50 feet from the top and 50 feet from the ground.
She didn't move at all during the rescue. She was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate some cookies afterwards.
That was a very unusual call.
I can't believe anyone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said:  Ruby was very lucky to get away with it. 
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified watching the relief effort.
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing to hold him again.
The vet said if she'd been too exhausted and passed out, she'd probably have fallen.
The fire department was amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We're so grateful to them, each one of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added:  We were afraid she would fall but she did not move. 
The fire department was great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never hooked up with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a backing vocalist on Jagger's song  Old Habits Die Hard  in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He flirted with me when I was 18".
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very nice".
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he "strongly denies" having made any advances to Katy Perry.
The agent added:  Maybe she's confusing him with someone else. 
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour that year.
Her new album,  Prism , landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing blames a Turkmen Islamic movement for the attack
"The backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia", the head of China's security services told a Hong Kong television station, according to a video posted on a website Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has named a particular organization since Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, drove their car loaded with gasoline cans against the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The ETIM, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of China's Xinjiang, was classified by the UN in 2002 as an Al-Qaeda-affiliated organization.
The movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The split of Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time we are told that an independent Scotland would have to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control at Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not in the headlines (and it was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend a lot of time bypassing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
So this is a story that is not a story.
And a story so old that it's now frozen: I first heard the gossip that independence means passport control over 40 years ago.
Yet, an interesting point has been overlooked in this interpretation of an old dust fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the directions of Europe, really?
Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
The real news for Europe is that the grand post-war plan for European unification is definitely deadlocked.
With the euro crisis, the Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposed to the EU or advocating for the euro to be abandoned as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and coming out of nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and drove the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the strain on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many people to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits. This was only true for Greece.
The European system has instead imposed on its members favourable exchange rates for German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are left with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dismal cuts in public wages and expenditure  encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper unease about productivity in Europe.
As a result of the green energy policies imposed by Brussels, which are a reason for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a cost-rewarding disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is brewing, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the struggling French economy to struggle.
The result: Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote  a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-money and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
I think that very soon the anti-European and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will unite and will eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like  the Europe of (sovereign) nations  free privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will turn a blind eye to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending people to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could settle for a freer European agreement provided we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
If not, we should follow Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is  and is notably  the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a dramatic majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence now if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty - aging early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the obesity epidemic may be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
 I spend a lot of time reassuring parents  generally, this does not indicate a rapid shift towards full puberty , Kaplowitz said.
Clear signs of development, such as breast budding, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there's been only a slight advance in the age of first menstruation over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, compared with 12 years three quarters of the time in 1970.
Once the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years for the first menstrual period to appear, said Kaplowitz, who also wrote Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will develop.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered  early  when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows or stops -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
A faster progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first menstrual period and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication and hormone treatment are based on the child's age, rate of development, rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication but acknowledges that  controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and girls' feelings of being different from others .
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have their period.
 They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues , Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter had her first period at the age of 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories that have been made public about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or the sexual messages portrayed in the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is that there is an obesity epidemic.
He was involved in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years old that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that influence it.
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls in this country.
There are various explanations.
On a global scale, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
Acne and pubic hair are common, even in infants and toddlers.
 We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty , said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to communicate with their child.
 This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned , Kaplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will generally respond well.
Girls who are experiencing early puberty need to be reassured that even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is a part of life.
A tribute to the Coen Brothers' folk
Inside Llewyn Davis by the Coen brothers, winner of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich Village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unable to hire Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary trio, Joel and Ethan Coen turned their attention to rising American movie star Oscar Isaac, 33, as well as global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs are performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich outfits of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less glossy clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing of the machine gun when she speaks.
Inside Llewyn Davis is a week-long story of the trials and tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He's willing to back down on the replacements in the studios.
Without a place to stay, he's on the couches of his friends who are still waiting for him.
It's like a documentary.
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a careerist but who's integrity-bound, with self-destructive behavior", Ethan Coen, who won several Oscars and awards at Cannes with his brother Joel, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis never existed, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before the advent of Greenwich Village, a New York City neighborhood that was destined to become "the epicenter of the folk music boom that would spawn international stars", as Van Ronk's friend journalist Elijah Wald writes.
The film then takes on the appearance of a documentary, from the dusty music label overrun by 33T, which is not sold, and is inhabited by an old secretary who cannot pay, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The Coen brothers' magic still works by incorporating a funny character that is constantly running through the film: a gorgeous red cat with a crackling eye, Llewyn Davis's lucky companion.
When asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled growing up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country.
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar", he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is necessary to "be considered good", "chance can also launch someone's career", and "increasingly today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gerard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He'll never know the word retirement.
The French phenomenon, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, The New York Times described him as "the spy novelist who knew too much".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the setting for the 198th and 199th volumes of the famous spy novel series.
Physically impaired by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling on this trip on a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he also went to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, claimed to be unaware of the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first in the series, almost half a century ago.
"Probably between 120 and 150 million all countries combined", he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment building on Foch Avenue, a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, with the evil eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages into which the adventures of SAS had been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting pirate editions", he added, pointing to a pile of books on the coffee table among the bronze or ivory brought back from the 130 countries he had traveled to place his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with a nice chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and CIA contractor to pay for the repairs to the family castle, is on the trail of all the bad guys on earth, communists in the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s onwards.
Each book has the same recipe: a great deal of geopolitics and exoticism, a few hard sex scenes, a little bit of violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary author", explained Gérard de Villiers.
I think of myself as a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send messages to.
He worked "like the great prewar reporters, the Albert London type, who went in and came back with real, lengthy investigations".
SAS's father used to say, "Do some kind of geopolitical soap opera".
"I am always looking at my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave", added Gérard de Villiers.
I met journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from the intelligence services, some of whom I've known for 20 or 30 years.
So many of his SAS are often prescient: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he told the story in "The Road to Damascus".
In "The Madmen of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in that city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the bombing.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported on the 4X4 columns of jihadists that were based in the Malian capital.
I am not a fortune-teller, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I am simply making assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM typewriter "all parts of which have been changed".
300 pages later, he would write the word "FIN" and correct every page with a pen.
On the walls of his office are AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly accused of machismo by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent, and courageous women.
I'm still very welcome in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He will not die, nor retire.
No more than I do.
Aircraft manufacturers are arguing about seat width when big orders are at stake
Disputes are raging among major aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers  who are not always the most coveted by airlines, but for whom the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week Airbus called on the airline industry to implement a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economy classes, but its major US rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute has erupted as aircraft manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range aircraft, hoping to potentially record orders at the event, which will take place from November 17-21.
The way in which the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft  in particular, whether there will be 9 or 10 front seats  is essential for the economic performance of the  mini-jumbo segment .
Boeing states that its redesigned 777X will be able to seat 406 people in economy class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
The giants of the aircraft industry often exchange blows on technical matters by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take the lead over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently saw what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo of three people fighting each other in a restaurant, titled Would You Accept This?
 Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft , said John Leahy, Airbus' chief commercial officer.
As eating habits change, people get fat, but the seats in airplanes haven't changed drastically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data.
The average American in the 21st century is 39.7 inches tall, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival is clinging to a seat concept dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the aircraft newly named  jet set  was narrower.
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study which indicates that an extra inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat width and claims that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and facilities.
He also says the study shows that cabin experience doesn't just depend on the width of the seats.
 It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they feel they need to do to get things done , said Kent Craver, Boeing's head of passenger satisfaction.
They don't want to be told what's going to make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
The dispute is a race for aircraft orders estimated to be worth at least $700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a 20% higher seat efficiency in their latest long-haul twin-engine models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured with 9 rows.
The unit cost savings are small compared to the aircraft configuration with 10 seats per row currently in service.
 Boeing is doing this to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products , said Kevin Keniston, head of Passenger Comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
 An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial standpoint, Airbus' proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777 , said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Airplane salesmen who travel the world even take a meter with them to check competing configurations.
While boasting of offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasised the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider side-by-side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say its call for the aircraft industry to set a seat size standard is unlikely to succeed, but it could make the 777X sales wave go away.
Oracle shareholders upset by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the proposed compensation for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, in light of his group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but it tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third richest man in the world, who has just been crowned by his boat's victory in the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Ellison had already been voted down on his salary last year.
The Oracle boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the fiscal year 2013 that ended in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but he did collect about $77 million tied to stock options.
His regular salary is only a symbolic dollar.
In the full year 2013, Oracle's net profit increased by 3,5% while the stock price jumped by 27,5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which gained 24% in the same period.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
More tests are needed before human trials begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said early signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but are discovering that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies track down all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice that were then given nicotine continued to function normally.
But the unvaccinated mice were calmer, the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have proven ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently to keep the antibody levels high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use were completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit.
 They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this can help them to lose their bad habit , he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but indicated that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a US drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, security services said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been reported several times in the past.
But intelligence, military and activist officials said this time he was killed in the strike in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike", a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a visit to London, had informed the British government that talks had been initiated with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial leasing policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a cafe, after they expired in August 2005 without a bidding process.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy general secretary, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressed for a tendering process.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the leases for the Circular Quay companies, which earned Obeid approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
But he denied that he had changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid, who, Mr Tripodi acknowledged, was calling for a change in the government's policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
 Was the subject of discussion during these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing policy?  asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy.
"No", said Mr Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but at least it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes are targeting Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official didn't specify who the target was, but he said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers holding a 457 visa may have to pass an authenticity test
The government is currently considering the possibility of introducing a  authenticity test  for foreign workers holding a 457 visa as it considers expanding the crackdown.
The test, if passed, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used for unqualified positions or as a diversion to bring family and friends to Australia.
A government working document was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
 The shattering statements about "foreigners returning at the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return to the days when unions were demanding a protected labour market, she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white people's work had to be protected and I wouldn't be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The working document lists the 12 measures previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others being reviewed.
If the authenticity criterion  were adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for the authenticity of the job offer in the case where the applicant is a personal relation or associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company .
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's frightened 9-year-old son was travelling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father died on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would bring the UK together.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the project.
Phase 1 will involve a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government raised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of journey times for the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said:  Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together. 
We are pushing forward with the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we face a capacity problem in our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
UK Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added:  Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. 
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support  unequivocally  the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said:  High-speed rail has the potential to deliver considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight to the overall project of a high-speed rail network across Britain.
 We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating a win-win situation and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
 I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps. 
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite the move by the United States to ease regulations on electronic devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in plane  mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it distressing not being able to access their electronic books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision requiring US carriers to do significant work to comply with the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
 CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on board aircraft, she said.
The matter is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure continuous safety and passengers to follow safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which has previously spoken to CASA about its plans to expand the use of its onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said it would follow the regulator.
 We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft , a spokesperson said.
Qantas has stated that it is complying with the current rules at this time.
 According to our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change this , she said.
The FAA's decision applies to American airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and will look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand baggage handling schedules and passenger instructions.
 Once an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes, the FAA said .
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under seats or in upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual fever spike on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about 30 people, according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween night, the party was heated on Pia's side where a fight involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
Four light injuries at least would be regrettable.
On alert, gendarmes went to the scene to separate the fighting and ensure that the wounded were treated.
Singapore's mortgage lenders are taking advantage of the middle class forced to tighten their belts
At a pawnshop in Singapore's Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it", says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is rising  that ValueMax, where it completed its transaction, this week became the third mortgage company to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Jewelry pledging is not only a quick way to get cash  $1,300 from Singapore in Ms Amirthalinga's case  but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singaporean mortgage lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, mortgage lenders have the advantage of not requiring credit check or proof of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to mortgage lenders as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and over-indebted households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income households are turning to mortgage lenders to bridge the gap as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, mainly stemming from rising mortgage lending, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
 The bottom line is that as costs rise, people in the middle and at the bottom of the [wage ladder] are looking to supplement their income in whatever way they can, says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to rush to pawn their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items pledged in the 200 pawn shops in the city-state are gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, so let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and come back for it next month".
In Thailand, the largest mortgage shop operator, EasyMoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The rise in the mortgage lending sector is such that ValueMax, which operates the Bendemeer store and 15 other similar stores in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia  where it already has four stores  but also outside Asia, says CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance them using 60 percent of the $66 million it raised this week on its IPO to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-interest lenders have been criticized for their exorbitant interest rates, Ms Yeah points out that mortgages not only offer lower rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
 Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt, she says. 
The pledge is increasingly accepted socially as a means of securing short-term guaranteed financing.
Also, people who go to mortgage lenders are not just those with financial problems.
Wealthy Singaporeans also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pawn gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can be up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all walks of life.
 These may be wealthy people who need short-term loans for business or investment, or small businesses who need cash to get through a tough time , adds Ms Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money real quick.
Pastor Accused of Child Pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who was working with youths in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia was charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following raids on his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist Church in Timberlay, where the pastor was serving, expressed deep sorrow at the news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins has resigned from his position.
The pastor was released on parole.
This includes not communicating with anyone under the age of 18 and not accessing the Internet.
He's due to appear in Halifax County Court in December.
He goes to the supermarket in a Nazi uniform, before he gets kicked out.
A man wearing a Nazi uniform with a swastika bracelet was asked to leave a British supermarket, with customers complaining to the store management who called the police, the store said on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store", explained a spokeswoman for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police for help, but "by the time she arrived, he had already left without a scandal", she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who looked upset.
People were stunned.
"You don't go out like that unless you want to attract attention", said a 60-year-old customer, Rosina Rusin, to the Cambridge News.
The incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween, when it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know whether this was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the attack on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS bracelet twice a week for three years at Asda", said Dutton, who said he had "mental problems".
A $325m rescue plan for Tasmania's health system
The Federal Government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the faltering health system comes with strict conditions to ensure that the State Government does not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking urgent measures  to end a crisis caused by the island state's ageing population, high rates of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding, which is for four years, was decided after consultations between the government and Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
 The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which we believe will address the unique difficulties facing the state , Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgeries.
2 600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help to make up for the delay.
Funding is also provided for appointment-free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better outpatient care, training for medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
 These investments are in line with the view that frontline clinicians believe this is the best way to treat Tasmania's healthcare system,  said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain the current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person committee will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and effective way possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325m will mean little unless it is followed by real reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system.
He nevertheless commended the government for responding to the urgent request for aid it had made to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
 I hope the federal aid plan will go a long way towards removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist , said Mr Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton thinks today's announcement is a "fortune solution".
"The reason we're here is because the state's Labor government has taken $430 million out of its health care system", he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government pulling in almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth putting in 300 million dollars, and pretend it's a big day.
Mr. Dutton visited Mrs. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the bailout would be spent on extra bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of the novel by Denis Diderot boasts remarkable artistic direction and meticulous re-creation of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never gets any lubrication or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed equipment essential for the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
A Syrian militant group also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the deadline for the
The European Union has also made a number of important contributions to the fight against terrorism, including the establishment of a European Union-wide anti-terrorism agency.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment will prevent Syria from producing new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The militant group, which tracks the evolution of the human toll through a network of militants based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, an estimated 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government estimates that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, of whom 18,678 were pro-government forces and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead were also 2,202 deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that figure since.
Some 2 million people have been displaced by the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting rebels, many of whom are linked to Al-Qaeda network groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting highlighted the serious dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal amid an ongoing civil war, within a tight deadline.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said that its team was now satisfied to have checked and destroyed all declared critical production and mixing and filling machines.
It added that  no further inspection activity was planned at the moment .
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria, abandoned and... that the chemical weapons program elements they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.
It was difficult to know at first sight whether Safira's unit was one of two sites that the OPCW inspectors were not allowed to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
 I salute the moral strength and courage that you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization , said the organization's Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war is mainly between Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger at the sentencing of one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted angrily to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Omar Patek should be shot by firing squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the bombings of two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings targeting churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors sought a life sentence, but they could have asked that the man, known as the "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as an expert in bomb-making, be sentenced to death.
The decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
She said, tearfully, that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged before the firing squad", Ms. Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any more grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb loaded into a van parked outside exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and was unconscious for a month, and he died three times while on respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek should have suffered the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre  Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra  who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces would kill former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
"He did not turn himself in", Mrs Corteen added.
Until recently, he laughed bitterly at the pain he might have caused others.
The verdict was handed down on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year with ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year", said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door to door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music  but not talk on their mobile phones  under highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and rules regarding aircraft storage to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
 Depending on the plan, we may approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They're not supposed to turn them on until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain gives the green light.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices when the aircraft descends before landing and not turn them on again until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines with aircraft that are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during takeoffs, landings and ground travel, the FAA said.
Most new passenger aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, expressed her happiness at these changes.
 Once the new policy is safely implemented  and we will work closely with carriers on that  it will benefit everyone , Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like  hall overseers  when it comes to this question.
But it will still be illegal to connect to the Internet for surfing, exchanging emails and text messages or downloading data from below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be required to turn their smartphones, tablets and other devices into airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-style game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was noisy thrown off an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while it was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always need to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cockpit.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority for cell phones is the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said that cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if used on board", Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the problem recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or they do so deliberately.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the day.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and are FAA-approved.
Airlines have been allowing passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Airplanes modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also have better resistance to interference.
The vast majority of airplanes should allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when a page is turned.
But the transmissions are louder when the devices are downloading or sending data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's executives loaded a Kindle e-book reader into a plane and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the aircraft is a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only anecdotal reports from pilots that the devices could interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them sensible arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
 We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety , said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
A bird propelled from a North Sea platform has been released into the wild
A bird, ejected after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The waterhole was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month before being restored by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa rescue centre.
The centre's director, Colin Seddon, said:  This water raft was probably a wintering migrant from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of strong winds in the North Sea. 
It seems that the exhausted bird managed to find shelter on the oil rig.
He added:  He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help. 
The water rally was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders, representing all business sizes, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting caught up in the long and arduous process of reforming the arcane institutions of Europe.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues  ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws  the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area. 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and most significantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted to see Britain continue initiatives for treaty change and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This finding, which is echoed by all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world is pushing for a significant change  that gives the UK power back.
The stakes are high  succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would see a 16 per cent swing in votes for remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for a moment: this survey shows that British businesses support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's EU membership.
It also shows that businesses hope that the renegotiation will be a significant shift in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible and increasingly necessary to better represent the interests of British businesses as the euro area moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States as Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not abolished the Halloween tradition.
He and his wife, last night, handed out candy to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the East Coast of the United States were canceled because of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the party people caught up.
In New York City, thousands of people in costume took part in the Greenwich Village parade.
Everyone is overjoyed, says one participant, Andrea.
I finally got to wear the costume I planned for last year.
We're having a great time, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, that's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of All Saints' Day, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller says the Bulgarian pipeline is ushering in a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
 A historic event has taken place today: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project , Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the whole European continent.
South Stream should diversify the export routes from Russia to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, the country through which the bulk of Russian gas to Europe is transported, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated  forever .
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced price as soon as the entire project is commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom has indicated that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island is planning to create the world's largest marine reserve, the Tahiti News reported Thursday, citing a report by Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 square kilometres, if we count three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live on Pitcairn, and their incomes depend 95 percent on the generosity of London.
The island's Council voted unanimously to create a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which is 836,000 km2 and corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to approve the request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be approved by the British Governor of Pitcairn, who is resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2 provided it had the means to ensure their surveillance, which it does not.
There is no airport on Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port for military surveillance vessels.
France has already had to carry out the very costly aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ in French Polynesia, near Pitcairn.
The FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft  but it will still be prohibited to make calls on mobile phones.

Life in prison for former Chinese vice governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin province in northeastern China was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for corruption.
Expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of taking more than 19 million yuan in bribes, Chinese state media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice governor, who was also the chairman of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's First Intermediate Court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office in March, made fighting corruption a national priority, saying it was a threat to the Communist Party's very existence.
While the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as it was with the "flies" - the junior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most recent and most dramatic case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions in the state.
But the government has shown no intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent body.

Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were charged with child sexual abuse following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 during a hearing of the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it  had never had to deal with a problem of sexual abuse of children within its organisation .
Chief Executive Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor at the Caringbah Hall YMCA was convicted of sexual assault on children at the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare told Commission counsel Gail Furness that he had been aware of the first case but not of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate, stressing,  External audits of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was a top priority for the organisation. 
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings out of four institutions in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit carried out in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's hiring and that he failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually assaulting 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare dismissed the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures with regard to child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain abuses, including Lord's being left alone with the children, keeping them private, having them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had sought child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, indicated that she found the child services manager at the Caringbah YMCA, Jacqui Barnat, who mentored Lord  very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time .
The CEO said he rejected staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these failures to their superiors.
Instead, he said that the friendly relationship they had with Lord had clouded their judgment, so they didn't report his actions.
Mr Hare said he had expressed his view to the board of the New South Wales YMCA that the organization's lesson from the Jonathan Lord incident should not be about staff reporting, and the board agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by the YMCA's Director General of Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was  overzealous  and that it had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were  serious problems  in the recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been adjourned until December 20th.
Tony Blair has said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but admits that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old gave his opinion on various national policies.
Since leaving in June 2007 after a decade at the helm, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have answered, according to the Evening Standard of London:  Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so... 
When many experts in equestrian events gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be fierce.
But no one expected to see a three-year-old, Fenton Kirkland, win.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first guns, the toddler and his Shetland Toffee pony trotted through the three laps with great ease and won first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable  who are the same size  were lauded for their presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he would wear his flat cap a little to the side in a casual manner to parade his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his unusual natural training qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee got very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a birthday present last March and has been training with his Shetland pony every day since.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee make a great duo".
They stood up to everyone, but they both stole the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all so happy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young man from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been competing in horse racing for over a decade.
Mrs. Howells said:  There was electricity in the air and everyone was cheering and applauding her. 
He ran the entire length of the track, and though he seemed very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is a big animal lover. He loves horses, tractors, the countryside, and he has two chickens to take care of.
The way he started, he's probably going to be in the Horse of the Year event soon and I'm sure he'll do a great job.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said:  Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony. 
They make a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee were performing well and the way they paraded on the track.
They're looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer. Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his nice clothes helped Fenton, he was really good-looking.
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal  will be rebranded 
A Chinese newspaper that issued a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be reviewed, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public company.
Now, the New Express will undergo a complete overhaul, the regulator said.
The order for  reworking  is issued by the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several erroneous articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The New Express editorial staff was disorganized", the regulator said in a statement.
He stated that he had decided  to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card .
He also  ordered Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it investigate the people responsible at New Express and immediately reorganize the management team of the newspaper .
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published a two-page call for his release, saying that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on a state television station where he admitted to publishing false stories for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win the public's trust", he told the state-run CCTV network.
I did it mainly because I was chasing after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several high-profile suspects recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle is "unavailable"
The carrier is in tow.
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of the two nuclear boilers at the Charles-de-Gaulle in mid-October while the ship was at sea was "safe for the sailors", but not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal Navy has just confirmed that the ship is "unavailable" until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
The company DCNS, which specialises in naval defence, said that its teams and those of Areva, which had been sent to the Var for the occasion, were "currently working on the aircraft carrier".
They are, among other things, replacing a pump on the failed boiler.
"Everything is being done to ensure that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013", DCNS explains.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not in any way call into question the nuclear-powered ship's programme of activity".
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle is coming out of a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had flown from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This is in particular to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small malfunction", confined to the reactor containment area, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For over a year now, I have been able to see the great discontent of people everywhere I meet: monstrous re-evaluations of their properties, floods of taxes, the cost of all kinds of permits, endless administrative fees.
In short, unlimited sipping from our pockets.
Millions of dollars wasted could be saved to allow for a taxation that is very respectful of those who pay.
Any money taken from taxpayers by force diminishes their freedom to consume and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major businesses, there is no problem with lavish spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: a cultural centre in deficit, a large subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they should be sold to private companies or demolished.
It is also regrettable that several properties have been expropriated to accommodate a major industry that never came.
I do, however, give honourable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the taxpayers?
It is not the public sector that should invest in such enterprises, but the private sector, based on consumer demand.
The townspeople were happy to hear that the Lakes of Fish and Piles will continue to supply the town with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (which are major water consumers) and the sharp decline in population, water use has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without wasting it, the city will never run out of water and the strict regulations on its use could be greatly relaxed.
In short, it is very easy to accomplish great things with other people's money.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city can't even afford to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been run for over 40 years by ties with good degrees for most of them and I don't think a sheep farmer would do worse.
Drug tunnel discovered between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated drug-trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation, and electrical railways, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 4-foot by 3-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The zigzag tunnel, which is nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, with San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is full of undefined warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs escaped unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men, who authorities say worked as chauffeurs, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers are exploiting vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard railroad-tracked passageway that ran from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant for Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a 'notice of surrender' against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual misconduct, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, requesting political asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard has issued a remand notice against a 40-year-old man asking him to report to a police station at a time and date of his choice, a spokesman said.
He's still violating the terms of his bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the police notice.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be charged with espionage, after leaking more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the anti-secret information website WikiLeaks.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to type into her smartphone or pay for her shopping?
Researchers in the United States, France and Japan predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors in phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy director general of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this biometric craze, but are concerned.
In 2011 alone, the French National Commission for Information and Freedom authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, hand shape or hand vein network in companies, government offices, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to identify themselves, anywhere, anytime", says Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in Washington.
Why is there such optimism in some people and such pessimism in others?
Biometrics will rely on new techniques, which will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the vein network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
"For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable", says Philippe Robin, technical director of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection and the checking of the vein network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a safety factor - you cannot capture this data without them knowing - and a disadvantage: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for some 20 years into other methods, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
The increased precision of sensors and the computing power of computers required for data analysis have made these techniques operational.
Facial recognition has increased tenfold in accuracy over the past five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture's R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and the Netherlands have deployed automated border crossings using facial recognition.
It's now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"We are currently doing research on voice recognition or walking with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment", says Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
DNA, a unique and unmistakable marker, also raises hopes and concerns.
"At the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data", confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospects at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very time-consuming and very expensive.
NEC offers the police forensic services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at a crime scene and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (assuring that the person is who he or she claims to be).
The identification process has so far been concerned with issuing identity papers: the biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information the State has on all citizens already registered.
This helps to ensure that someone is not trying to steal someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison can have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
"We take the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them with the photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet", explains Dany Nassif, NEC France's business development manager for biometric identification solutions.
Another use is to photograph a quidam in line at a store, track its progress using facial recognition, and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication was initially concerned with physical access (border, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, attendance checks have been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of a boyfriend pointing to another", explains Cyrille Bataller of Accenture.
But increasingly, authentication will also apply to transactions, especially those made from internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some dealers by inserting a card and placing your hand on a biometric reader - this gesture replaces typing the secret code.
A similar technique is being tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and major retailers: when paying in a store with a credit card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a vein-scanning reader.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon be available to French traders.
Guidance for users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays at the checkout 30 seconds less, it's a good thing", explains the manager of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services, so in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you customized options.
Finally, it should reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"Fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is locked if you try to move it", lists Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, without extensive research, it is impossible to know whether these discourses really convince users.
Privacy experts, on the other hand, continue to be concerned.
"Advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras, and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance", predicts Andrew Patrick, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs has been fined £1,000
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be carried between his legs.
At Colchester Crown Court, Howie admitted to the offence of driving without due care and attention.
The seven points removed from his license led to a six-month license revocation.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 in costs and a £100 victim surcharge.
A tax on foreign property owners to burst the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, included a 7% stamp duty on properties costing over £2m and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a company rather than as individuals.
Stamp duty is already applied to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, which is more than the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and the Yorkshire and Humber region combined.
Mr Cook said:  Following the increase in stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance legislation in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high value properties are undertaxed independently of the effects of the outdated housing tax system. 
But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell, he added.
Luxury property  the 5 to 10 per cent of the highest prices in the housing market  in the prosperous South West London area, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8 per cent last year.
Prices in central London have been growing steadily year on year by 5.6%, but have been overshadowed by a growing domestic market, with the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city experiencing a recovery, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have recently uncovered how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs moved their tail more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known that in humans the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions".
Here we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that, as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and that both hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disorderly movements of other dogs' tails, researchers tracked animals while they watched movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained:  We showed dogs films featuring other dogs  either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion  and we were able to manipulate the movement of the tail and present it as going further to the left or to the right. 
When the animals saw a dog with no expression wagging its tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), they were perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail that was mostly veering to the left (again from the dog's point of view as he was waving the tail), their heart rate sped up and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not be concerned about.
He added:  If you repeatedly encounter other dogs and notice that, most of the time, their tail movement to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to that experience. 
The researchers say that the findings could help owners, veterinarians, and trainers to better understand the emotions of their pets.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Science, said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when they looked at a happy dog.
And in another scientific study done by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said:  Dogs were more likely to go to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious  the opposite of what was found in the Italian study. 
He said that the differences might be due to the fact that the dogs in the different studies did not fully consider the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
 Although many evidence from different mammals indicates that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified  and dogs are no exception , he said.
However, given how easily their behavior can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed a Glasgow show due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a Glasgow concert after their lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was due to perform at The Hydro concert hall in the city centre on Friday.
However, her laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a gig at Birmingham's LG Arena on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated:  Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November. 
 Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert. 
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets are valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets for any further assistance.
Pope Francis to appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect him, so Francis will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope  this therefore falls to a group of 120  cardinal electors .
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony at which bishops would be elevated to the dignity of cardinals, known as the consistory.
 Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world , Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably have decreased.
He said that a pope would usually appoint as many cardinals as he needed to get the number of cardinals electors to 120 and as many cardinals over 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment there is a tendency to favour Europe and Italy in particular.
It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance, he added.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with examining ways to reform the church.
Before, the pope made his own decisions.
 From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , Valero explained.
He added that it was  quite possible  that Francis would seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation  it is completely new.
Valero said that popes usually elevate bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was  full of surprises  so we don't know who he will appoint .
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the US to fix the seat back
General Motors Co. is recalling nearly 19,000 of its 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address a problem with manually tilting backs, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
 If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the headrest may not be protecting passengers properly, increasing the risk of injury , according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM's pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the top US automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect during the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owner information letter due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, rose about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on the New York stock exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred at about 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, just off the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
Evidently, work on the foundations had been going on for some time.
A wall of foundation was just being built in the last days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the construction site to retrieve his tools.
I was driving by and saw the wall collapse with a large cloud of smoke", said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I came down and went to remove the big bricks that were covering it.
You could only see part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
Authorities say the victim was an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a company that makes formulas.
Reanimation manoeuvres were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his severe injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Safety and Health Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice, believing in the possibility of change.
He says Obama's efforts have been laudable, but thwarted by the Republican Party's obstructionism.
Obstructionism does not excuse the Obamacare problems, nor the drone attacks.
The 2008 Obama campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I've been reading a terribly sad book these days.
It was a book that I thought would encourage me through the gloom of my second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called The Audacity to Win and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patients' medical reports at night and go to bed, this book brings me back to the days when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide victory and news anchors took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents saved all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries were moving toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before he took office in 2008, he had 82 percent favorable opinion.
And then I close the book.
It's hard to wake up and go back to the present, it's like coming out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those days of optimism, it's like distant memories, a sad reminder of opportunities from the past.
The change really happened in the years after I first voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I give Obama credit for great accomplishments, from passing the Affordable Care Act to leaving Iraq with our military, to ending the never-before-seen-and-unknown, and killing Osama bin Laden.
Also, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the areas of immigration reform, public health care, and the closing of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after many times defending the Obama administration in front of my peers and colleagues, I can't give any more explanations.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the drone attacks on innocent foreign children.
It can't explain the National Security Agency collecting data on the private lives of Americans, or the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal government misdeeds.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the overspending of presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And, more recently, she can't excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if this is what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and random events, like the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected to a second term, free from the pressures of future elections, would deliver on the promises we've been hearing about for so long.
Yet, as the favourable opinion index dipped below 45 percent this week, it's even harder to go back to the year 2008 through this book.
It makes me long for the many promises that have flown by.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
At a meeting after the campaign, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay loyal to their cause.
 I want us to focus on our talent , he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris only.
On Friday, at around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The motorcyclist, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the quick intervention of the rescue, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Congressman Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who is disputing the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has made this argument to try to rule out questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
 He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave , said Mr Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer had won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.
Mr Palmer has suggested a reworking of the voting system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
 We need a better system , he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can log in, enter your contact information into a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of paper pencils to mark the ballots.
Is it so you can erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied the options available with regard to electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new role  very seriously .
The exercise of public office is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for any reward, except the reward of the story because we have to serve the community at a critical time", he added.
A team of biologists led by the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, a scientific mission officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM), reports on the discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
That's good news, but it doesn't surprise me.
Whereas in the past species were described and identified on the basis of morphology, anatomy and geography, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of the sciences of species classification.
And it is not impossible that such advances in genetics and molecular biology will challenge the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on the morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged by advances in genetics.
Similarly, two species which are morphologically very similar have been distinguished by genetic means.
This is the case with the newly identified species.
About a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily - the Pacific humpback dolphin and the Atlantic humpback whale.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this a discovery of such importance as the Wildlife Conservation Society has claimed?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know about these genetic differences in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
While this population was known to researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, found only in this area.
So if a mass death problem caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could be dealing with a species extinction, rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widely distributed species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered endangered or endangered depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility of it recovering from neighbouring stocks.
As regards Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it so rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there is a lot of genetic exchange between populations and individuals.
This gene-bonding restricts the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which may eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least known environment.
We'd rather send robots to Mars than find out what lives in the Mariana Trench, only seven miles above the surface of the sea.
We spend more money looking for life on other planets than we do marine research, and it's about time that changed.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources familiar with the matter, which shows once again that the global investigation by regulators into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in their investigations into the world's largest financial market, where US$5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the broadening of the investigation which echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
 The ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators , a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources familiar with the matter said that RBS had passed on files of emails and instant messages sent to and by a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash foreign exchange trading at Citi, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources familiar with the file added.
UBS said this week it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations made about bankers who have conspired to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources familiar with the matter said.
Banks are scanning instant messages and emails sent over the years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news of these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment bank trading units in recent years but has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the issue by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own internal platforms  explains why it is possible to start having an impact on the market at low cost .
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working at its London Stock Exchange office this week after he caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
 We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was brought under control , said a representative of Credit Suisse.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford was foiled, says lawyer
After police confirmed they had obtained a copy of the video that showed Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine, Mr Clayton Ruby claimed he had never seen an investigation "so badly botched".
Ruby told The Canadian Press that she believed police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, 35, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police also said they saw this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Mr Ruby called it "inexplicable" that police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Police Chief Bill Blair made a knowing choice not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions by their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Ms Ruby's comments "an obvious and desperate attempt" to make a case for herself in the media in a case that has nothing to do with her.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock markets down at mid-session, with the exception of London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges were down on Friday at mid-session, driven by some disappointing company news, while Wall Street was expected to rise.
Investors are also cautious as they fear that the US Federal Reserve may unwind its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) might ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures are predicting a bullish opening for U.S. stocks after two consecutive sessions of declines.
Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline in the CAC 40, led by the warning on results from its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) is the worst performing bank on the EuroFirst300, having also published lower results this morning and announced the creation of a "bad bank" structure with £38 billion of the most risky assets.
Vodafone (+2.45%) remained the leading EuroFirst300 in response to a press report that AT&T was considering a possible OPA.
Speculation on the ECB's monetary policy developments is well under way on the foreign exchange market, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, has shown.
The ECB's single mandate has always been about inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong downward potential for the euro.
Against this background, the euro continued to fall against the US and reached a two-week low at $1.3517.
The same conjectures support the euro area bond market in reverse.
The Supreme Court upholds the Obama health care reform bill.
A major victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health care reform law that Obama signed into law to be constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges upheld the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, or face a fine  and declared it constitutional under the government's taxing power.
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The Court also upheld the other sections of the 2,700 page law and further found that the provision of the Health Reform Act, which states that the Medicaid eligibility threshold must be lowered or all federal funding for the program is lost, was constitutionally coercive.
The process to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican presidential candidates running in the 2012 primaries, including the nominee Mitt Romney, have fiercely opposed the bill.
A vibrant tribute to the war veterans of Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and fallen from all wars on Friday afternoon.
Grains were laid in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinians and Israelis clash at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were wounded on Thursday evening, 31 October 2013, in a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday, November 1 after running out of fuel, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another senior Hamas military officer, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a raid 100 meters into the territory before retreating.
The confrontation lasted for half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zouhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said that Israeli soldiers had been killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during a Zionist occupation raid on Khan Younes.
Several enemy were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas insists that Gaza will be hell for the occupier", the spokesman threatened.
The Israeli military said that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed to have used the tunnels to fight Israel, saying the purpose was to kidnap Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting the IDF forces and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians", said army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday.
A US official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not provide details on the target.
"In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah", he added.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi-owned channel said that "the bombing targeted a shipment of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that is fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard at dawn on Wednesday at an air defense base in Sonar Jable, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, relying on a network of activists and medical sources, was unable to identify the source of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies by Satie.
An evening where you can see the whole Chouinard prism, from art to tics and black to ink to white.
A white screen is used as a backdrop.
On the carpet, so white, in the vast space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advances, profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its shape.
And this shape will be the whole room: an envelope of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, all dressed in black, only their hands and faces uncovered, wait on either side of the playing field, rush when the next figure appears, embody it, and come running.
This black and white play by Henri Michaux is performed in solo relay, in unison group (a mass that does solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thought is "Morning Glory", where Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks on posters, laid out in a line in the foreground.
It's the same principle, the giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance floor, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monochord and monotone in the cry, and continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to go back.
This loud, energetic sound, if prolonged, eventually causes deafness and numbness.
So does the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - image creation has always been a strength at Chouinard - like those hair that twitches or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has imposed herself, with her tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt shapes, open up a wider and more gigantic imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the ending, in negative, with its dancers chopped by stroboscopic light and the white signs in a theater suddenly dark, touches on the magic.
The audience liked it, the reception was warm.
Gymnopedies, after the intersection, is richer.
The stage is partly covered in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers take turns to play the music.
Their musical awkwardness, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, couples are performing in a romantic, sensual, even erotic, duo.
Group work, small solo transitions, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Clowns appear, as familiar to Chouinard, with red noses, in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnivorous, elusive or gambler.
The gestures, the laughter and the small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the graceful and the ridiculous of the bodies into coitus, the fading beings.
But the play takes off after the salvation.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cavort, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated mess that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it's Chouinard's art to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are being sued over Nortel's patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nortel patents began a spate of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it hanged at the patent auction that took place after Nortel went bankrupt.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising related to search terms on the Internet, the court found, which is the core of Google's business.
It was not possible to reach the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google raised its bid several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel's patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market based in part on Motorola's patent library.
 Although it failed to acquire the patents at issue at auction, Google infringed and continues to infringe those patents,  the court's findings stated.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion in Gesves: a faulty water heater caused the explosion
Grandma lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which left two seriously injured on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, the deputy prosecutor of the King said on Friday evening.
The expert sent by the prosecutor's office assures us that the explosion was purely accidental.
Grandma lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a buildup of gas.
The vital prognosis for both victims is still in place.
Grandma was thrown out by the blast and badly burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned for a long time on the spot before being taken to the Liège CHU, she in a helicopter, he in an ambulance", said the mayor José Paulet, who arrived at the scene.
Traumatized, Grandpa was upstairs when the explosion happened.
He was able to reach the ground floor safely by stairs that remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door, which was damaged by the explosion, were relocated by the CPAS president.
Andenne and Namur firefighters and the Arches police responded.
Crisnea Civil Protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but it is unlikely that his triumphal day will mark the end of political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a new Egypt  when he took the oath of office as president, becoming the first freely elected president to succeed Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
When he was sworn in by the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black robes of the court whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
 We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic , President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
 Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life  absolute freedom, true democracy and stability , explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for more than 84 years since its formation has been considered an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidential glamour of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic "wheel of rescue" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and his speech on Friday in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work started during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
 Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state , said Mohamed Morsi, wearing a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges in the wood-carved hall where he took the oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi visited Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he put himself on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui was present at the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song  The people and the army, hand in hand...  sung by thousands of people gathered in the university's great amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, had ousted him from.
But by agreeing to take the oath of office before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is the custom, he bows to the will of the army and shows that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The US shutdown has slowed the rise of the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal offices weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, manufacturers' figures showed Friday, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts had anticipated an average of 15.4 million sales at an annualized and seasonally adjusted rate but the market stood at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's clients, he believes that the slight setback is primarily due to "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first fortnight of the month".
GM, however, reported a nearly 16% increase in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared with the 211,563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pickup trucks, saw its sales increase by 14% year on year to 199,985 vehicles, while the consensus was 194 301.
Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared with 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also reported sales below the consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM stock was up 1.4% at 4:35 GMT while Ford was down 1.1%.
Renault put on the stock exchange by Nissan's warning
Renault recorded the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders reported.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a change in its management.
Several traders reported that Renault stock was affected by the "warning" this morning.
"This is clearly Nissan's profit warning", says a trading manager at a Paris brokerage.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French one, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another seriously injured Friday night by gunfire from two people on a motorcycle that passed a neo-Nazi party venue in the western suburb of Athens, a police source said.
The police were not able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Golden Dawn members had claimed that the victims were guards of their club.
The injured person was immediately taken to hospital, according to the same source.
Police from the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place, and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after six Golden Dawn MPs, including the party's leader and founder, were charged with participating in a "criminal organization" in an offensive against the party that was launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has had his call rejected and will be suspended for the next two Champions League matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
After being sent off against Barca for striking Neymar, the Scottish midfielder was given a three-match suspension by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing his call was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes were without power across the province as of early Friday afternoon, due to strong winds hitting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentians with 15 042 subscribers in the black, Montérégie with 13 464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The Greater Montreal area is also experiencing a lot of outages with nearly 7000 homes without power in the city and in Laval.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past because of the Internet?
Flight Center seems to be reversing the trend.
The company revised its net profit forecast upwards and expects record results from holidaymakers from Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to achieve an underlying profit for the full year of between $325 and $340 million before tax, compared with a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent a growth of 12 to 17% compared to the record profit of 290.4 M$ achieved in 2011/12.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had achieved 8% profit in the first half and that the second half had started strongly, particularly for non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results for the whole financial year before interest and taxes", he said.
This is the case for Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, the Flight Centre leisure travel sector performed well while business customers spent less.
Its US subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year, when seasonal demand was weaker, and was expected to make a profit for the third consecutive year.
Flight Center shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown gunmen shoot at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids
Unidentified masked gunmen opened fire on a hotel near the pyramids in Cairo, Egypt on Friday, leaving no casualties, apparently as a result of a dispute with fired employees.
The attackers fled, said Interior Ministry spokesman, General of Police Abdel Latif.
The attack comes as Egypt has received almost no tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodyly suppressed protests by his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, students will be required to study at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British work of fiction from 1914 to the present.
The review will also present  new texts  to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math curricula tomorrow  the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It will make changes in other basic subjects next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the exam regulatory body, will unveil a restructuring of the GCSE structure, with a new grading system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister for Education, said there was  wide consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , stressing that the GCSE would be  more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous .
Studies show that English schools spend less time in maths (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
By comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore do about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal requirement to devote more hours of schedule time to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE in in-depth maths  as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings  would likely encourage schools to provide more class hours.
The programme will focus more on  real world problems , in particular financial mathematics.
This means that a bill passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
An 80-year-old welcomes kids with a gun to the Muy for Halloween
The miners, aged 9 and 13, went door to door asking for candy on Halloween night.
One of the neighbors in the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man told the police that he was afraid.
His gun was seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II and has never been found, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte", he assured the daily newspaper, citing archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would answer one of the great puzzles of the postwar era.
The German secret service, the BND, was thus assured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was totally wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a makeshift grave near the former Reich Air Ministry by a commando", according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing a "general's uniform".
"In the left inner pocket were his service record with a photo", he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the Mitte district town hall in Berlin stating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the district.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists should be buried in a Jewish cemetery is a huge tasteless thing.
"The memory of the victims is being crushed", he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who was never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "Final Solution" and had Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962, under his command.

Dr Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon's villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 for every 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the year 2013.
You can vote for him, or any of the other 10 heroes, to be elected CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of unconsciousness and visiting hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would haunt him for the rest of his life.
 There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years escorting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get whatever treatment he could benefit from.
 It is not easy , Mr Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5:00, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation hasn't changed much since Dr Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor for every 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditure is spent in the private sector.
 The only problem they have is poverty , Dr Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try and change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed over 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he started a non-profit humanitarian organization, ASCOVIME, that goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 others, they pile into vans after fixing medical supplies on the roof and cross rough terrain to reach the villages where help is most needed.
Luck doesn't always follow.
They had to push their vehicles over rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes - the community throws a party, sings and dances, and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr Bwelle  with his big smile and overflowing energy  is more than happy to join in the festivities.
The next morning, the team starts seeing hundreds of patients.
 We receive 500 people each visit , said Mr Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses or a free birth certificate  document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
At night, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
Surgeries are usually performed in a school, town hall or home; after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the wake room to give his place to the next person.
With the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers are working until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a grueling rhythm, but the village musicians usually help the team stay motivated.
 They are beating on drums all night to keep us awake so we can continue working , Mr Bwelle explained.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their presence can make a difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free surgery he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"It will change my future and that of my family", the man said.
In addition to running this travelling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
He explains that this second job is the one that finances his association by 60%, the rest being covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he sleeps", said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to raise money for his charity so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle on his missions, it's a learning opportunity in the field that they don't have at home.
 We could have been involved in operations to help with the sponge blood or to get the instruments to Dr Bwelle , Ms O'Malley explained.
It's not something you get to do in America when you're a sophomore in med school.
Student volunteers usually pay for their journey to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their boarding, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He is a hero, there is no doubt about it", said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not going to die.
For Dr Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by fulfilling the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
 I am so happy when I do this job , Mr Bwelle added.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons I do this.

The Two French by Pierre Nora
For a long time, academics have struggled to define and locate Nora's stone.
Teacher in theatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but pointing out his weakness for crossroads, sci-po, higher education.
Arbitrating other people's works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Yes, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Yes, but I know that such a sacrament cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which he has passed.
They were happy to see him as a great awakener, a promoter and a unifier of their work, but they noted that he was unwilling to produce it himself.
The monument to the "Locations of Remembrance", to which he gave his name, also contributed to this uncertain image.
The wicked tongues could see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye and a weight of scholarship, but an incurably amateurish one.
The two books Nora published nearly two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had written a lot and well.
This book should do him justice once and for all.
Yet, once again, the temptation to be omnipresent, intellectual wandering, and the joy of jumping from one subject to another.
But it is easy to see that the disparate objects collected in this book with such a beautiful title bring the dealer back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive knot of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: this is a contemporary concern.
Here is a short, collective call to give a definition.
But in the peremptory mind of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
The only thing that was needed was to deploy the accidents, and the matter, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one Pierre is after is a different one.
He does not claim to inherit an eternal frankness, he refuses to accept the definition.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented by irritating questions.
The question is this: why, in a country so permanently settled within its borders, so historically timber-framed and solidly masonred, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are only so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, as to avoid the turmoil that has arisen from the discord of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most iconic is obviously the one that splits the national story in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but could not deny it; on the contrary, it was anxious to recover its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility, so much so that it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing beats four steps outside the Hexagon, so the American escape of Pierre Nora might well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France both made a revolution, wrote a bill of rights, wanted to start a new society.
But American cousinage only enhances our uniqueness.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to care.
Here, men overwhelmed by an Old Regime indigenous, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution, but here it has sown drama and confit.
There are founding fathers who are always honored, and here are revolutionary fathers who are hard to make role models of, and who have killed each other.
There is institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, as well as so many mistakes to be made up and attempts to be made up.
France that goes, France that comes
Yet there was a time when the French believed they could sew back the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
At this central and creative moment of the Third Republic, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: he greeted those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in the old France obscurely prepared the modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity was short-lived.
It is once again in the debate, being shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France as it goes and the circumspect sketch of France as it comes.
And as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should have some surprises.
We find out that the chimney sweep was a homemaker.
The man of many curiosities was a little obsessed with the same idea.
The edge-walker stood in the center of the center.
And he who had submitted, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of a nation, but had avoided the initial exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will eventually do it.
Certainly in a less rigid, more split and more subtle form.
But let us not be mistaken, it is equally binding.
For far more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is rather complex to handle"
Kidnapped in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team who were filming a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later on 27 November 1987.
He has been a member of the Knesset since 2008 and has been a member of the Knesset since 2011.
Its main objective is to provide the hostages with the opportunity to file a complaint and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
After being held for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of AQIM (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they were reunited with their families.
And try, little by little, to get back to their normal lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" interviewed Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
From the night you were released, you were on the set of the 8pm "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your liberation today?
On the ground, including in Beirut.
When I was released, I found myself in the trunk of a car where I met - without seeing him because it was dark - Roger Auque.
He says we're free, but I'm not sure, and he says we can still get killed.
We're very excited, but we're also very tense.
It's war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They drop us off at the side of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the Summerland Hotel site where the press is present.
Frenchmen are taking us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a T-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a brief evening of talking with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means of evacuating to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Once there by helicopter, we take a private plane back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boarded.
How did you get to French soil?
We're landing at Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, is here.
That's a little rough.
There's an incredible amount of jostling going on.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I come back, and there's a lot of them.
The flight down the stairs, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all of it is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car, which Roussin drives.
The bikers are all out there taking pictures and following me home where I have to do a little policing to keep some of them from getting on.
The pressures are enormous.
It's not over. We're in a good place to know.
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so great that it's hard to see clearly.
We're coming out of a hole and all of a sudden we're in the media spotlight.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we did the hardest thing.
Even at night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV too.
Then start some sort of rehab, very slowly, for a month or two, which is kind of like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I had my first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grace the days after I returned: X-rays, all kinds of tests and a meeting with a psychiatrist.
It's not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not left to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostage takers.
It made sense.
I didn't mind that.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I listen to what's being said.
The debate on ransoms is one of them.
Some things annoy me, some less.
I am trying to balance the issues of my past as a hostage with my hat as president of the Hostages of the World Association, which allows me to put distance, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I'm wondering, for example, what is the definition of resilience?
Most of all, I'm fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the hostage's legal status.
I think there's a semantic problem.
We must call hostage taking "political" hostage taking - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostage takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in sympathy, in emotion, and rejoicing at the release of these hostages.
But who's to say that these hostages might have access to justice, too?
A court in The Hague is for that.
Why don't we tell the hostage takers, "You have violated the rules of war, as all Geneva Conventions do, we will bring you to justice"?
But it seems to me to be well-founded, legitimate, common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
That's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the streets to denounce Morsi trial
Anger is raging in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A nationwide mobilisation to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, says this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to get a copy of the case files.
This is not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial. If a pro-Morsi insurgency arises, he is the one who is supposed to bring Sisi to trial, not the other way around.
Morsi must try Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police will be deployed outside the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine US states of violating gay rights
Since the federal government recognized same-sex marriage, "all spouses of military personnel are entitled to a Defense Department ID and the benefits that come with it", the minister recalled in New York City in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he said, accusing those states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defense said he's ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the federal law is enforced.
The nine-state sweep began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard installations, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal law on gay marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage at about 5,600 active-duty personnel, including 17,000 National Guard, reserve and retired personnel.
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2nd at the skate park in Hyères.
The competition, organised by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration takes place on Saturday morning from 9am and the qualifying stages will start at 10am, before the final at 3pm and the awards ceremony at 4pm.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people, some of whom are already attending competitions at the highest level, such as the young heroic prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he likes nothing more than to show off to competitors who are three heads ahead of him.
Toronto mayor chases reporters who came to question him on a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of using drugs, according to several media reports.
A video released to the courts seems to support those suspicions.
The suspect, Rob Ford, has always denied using crack, but admitted to having a penchant for cannabis.
This Thursday, he kicked several reporters off his property who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes images don't need explanation or commentary.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin, while France has been free of native cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies has been confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and treat those who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive", the health and agriculture ministries said.
"Five people who had contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have been given preventive treatment.
"Preventive treatment of human rabies in humans, given after contact with the host animal but before symptoms appear, is very effective", the report states.
The departments now call on persons who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin injured by this kitten or whose pet has been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"As France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or the mother was imported from another country, not free", the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded "indigenous" case of rabies was in December 1998 in a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A rabies case involving a dog illegally imported from Gambia was reported in 2008.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if not treated in time", the ministry reminds, and it is transmissible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backs down on his health care reform
Amidst a barrage of criticism, President Obama yesterday reversed his unequivocal and often repeated promise that if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
 The vast majority of people with a suitable health insurance can keep it , he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls a "news flare" about terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received such notices to seek new insurance in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive, better-suited health plans for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll come out winning", he said.
The Administration has announced that it should come as no surprise if the 5% of the population who buy their own insurance are forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better", said Kathleen Sebelius in her testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Ms Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace in October had failed  regrettably .
"I'm as frustrated and angry as anyone", she added.
I can't wait to earn your trust again.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, when she thought her microphone was cut off, addressing an assistant sitting behind her in the House session yesterday following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Republican Representative from Missouri, about whether she should sign on to Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept asking Mrs. Sebelius why the architect of the Affordable Care Act hadn't voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to sign up for a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel presents a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while also integrating the notions of speed and heat into the track.
German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula One world champion, presented a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix free practice on Friday.
Vettel selected 1,500 designs from around the world for a competition sponsored by one of his car companies.
He was invited to watch the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and so he can see the German champion up close, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, at the trials.
He'll likely have another special helmet for the race on Sunday, destined to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
Aubervilliers resident launches his Suburban Party
Let's not fool ourselves.
In the mind of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "suburb party" is not just for the suburbanites.
I chose a map of France as my logo, he justifies.
When I say suburbia, I am referring to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented at a press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers on Thursday, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, the great cultural melting pot that characterizes the districts above all.
My number one proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
He was active in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, and then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left, but if the right-wing people are willing to support me, I will listen to them too, he continued.
I only talk to extremist parties.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his programme - which can be viewed on the Internet - from many themes that are supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of building keeper...
He says that he still needs to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene. "For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be right".
It's a matter of time and money.
The Suburb Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope in other cities as well.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the emails of support I've been getting since yesterday are not all from the suburbs", he rejoices.
John Kerry has admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage has gone too far in an inappropriate way.
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the US defensive stance towards its surveillance programmes by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, spying  had gone too far in an inappropriate way .
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, had ruled on  autopilot  when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities came to light.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said:  It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned some things on autopilot because we had the opportunity, from World War II through the difficult years of the Cold War and then of course on 9/11. 
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had gone too far, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said:  In some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate way. 
And the President is determined to try and make it clear and clear to the people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels deceived.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added:  We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up. 
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they do?
We have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we were able to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns over the alleged US espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the US, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terror organizations because of the frustration over the National Security Agency's surveillance.
 It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain by our side in mutual engagement in the fight against terrorism , said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term and chairman of the U.S. Senate European Affairs Subcommittee, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to go to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA's programs.
The press reports that the NSA has intercepted millions of communications in Europe, which has strained relations with some US allies, however the agency's director said this week that this was inaccurate and a misunderstanding as it involved metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations included documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
Intelligence director James Clapper justified Allied espionage by saying it was necessary and common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, which was scheduled to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He said the route was still to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, but also to show  loving firmness .
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the kind of spying programmes they themselves have been implementing for years.
 We can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world doing espionage , said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is planning to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.

Australian woman appeals her sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver has appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of making false statements after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who were controlling her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story out of thin air.
She was held in a cell at the local police station before her trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Office to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was extremely concerned for their daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We obviously had a very anxious time, but we hope to get her home safely as soon as possible", Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released after a 50,000 baht bail was paid.
In Australia, the press reported that she was on holiday in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a harsher sentence of up to two years in prison and incarceration in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder in Phuket of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith, Thailand may also be looking to repair its deteriorated image with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht fans who came with cars other than RSCA
The French police have decided to impose strict rules regarding the match between Royal Sporting Club Anderlecht and Paris Saint-Germain scheduled for Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman for the Brussels police area, said on Friday afternoon.
The Belgian RSCA supporters who wish to attend this Champions League match will have to use the RSCA's travel system.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post in Rekem to the PSG stadium", the spokeswoman said.
The same procedure will be followed on the return journey.
"If other fans had any intention of travelling to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has announced that measures have been taken to arrange for arrests and even sight-guards", Marie Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of pupils have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what prompted a consultation with parents, pupils, teachers and education staff a year ago to consider ways of better integrating pupils who live in different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision for "Living Together in French".
The organisation Vision diversité has been walking around schools for a year to help students from all backgrounds discover common points of reference that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, great names of artists, whether they're native or from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects so that they identify with all of this", explains Aïda Kamar, president of Vision Diversity.
Michel Venne of the New World Institute identified several challenges for the school board.
"For example, the transmission of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we are experiencing among the student clientele", he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has set up a research centre which will provide tools for teachers who, themselves, sometimes come from abroad.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to run a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different educational strategies are what is really needed", she says.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, educational, social and cultural.
