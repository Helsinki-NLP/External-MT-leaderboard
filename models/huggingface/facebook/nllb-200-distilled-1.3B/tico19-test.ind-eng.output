Cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rising rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in EU/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, although the stage varies from country to country, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, states, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will require health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the disease was a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 patients develop mild illness, namely respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more severe illness and requires hospital treatment, while another 6% of cases develop a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we examined the trend of cumulative COVID-19 incidence in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared it with incidence in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, COVID-19 has experienced further geographic spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with a confirmed COVID-19 case based on WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with those dates included, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases per country worldwide is updated daily at 08.00.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as compare them to trends in Italy.
As an active COVID-19 case prevalence proxy, we calculated cumulative incidents over 14 days, so taking into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present cumulative case figures reported by country as of 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to Italy's cases during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of cumulative incidence of 14-day COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, cumulative incidences of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February, then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This trend was mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar trend of increasing cumulative COVID-19 incidents (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, as of 15 March at 8.00am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trend in cumulative COVID-19 incidence suggests that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the differences in the stages experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region described the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EEA level are only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data are not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 show large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and secondary care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and secondary care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimated prevalence of COVID-19 inpatient cases for each EU/EEA country and the UK associated with a risk >90% exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
As cases are so far clustered in a specific region in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a specific regional service coverage population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of Regional Unit Names for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, states, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for a scenario of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is the case in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as rapid increases in case numbers, as anticipated, may not provide enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt to the appropriate response if not implemented earlier.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity when countries have the potential to further enhance their containment efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, other EU/EEA healthcare systems are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a human catastrophe.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and affects older people more than younger people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving research subject.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate this menacing disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been ordered to stay home during the holiday and the weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus disease.
It is very homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1" and has the potential to be more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 that established virus sequences isolated from several patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in this rapidly developing new subject area.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoVs, namely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis and some other unanswered but pressing questions.
Traditionally, CoVs are considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of colds.
However, in this century, we've found two highly pathogenic CoVs for humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing outbreaks that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, infections of healthcare providers were reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On 23 January, a regional quarantine was imposed in Wuhan city and all public transportation was stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered to be the initial site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
As the situation is evolving so rapidly, the final extent and severity of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
As of 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more updated epidemiological picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially those aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, only a few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is spreading in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from conception to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, in line with mass transit time before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality adjusted for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large coiled viruses that contain single-stranded RNA sense.
CoVs can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
The bulk or spike (S) envelope glycoprotein binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was first reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% among 10 sequence samples; the samples were taken from the outbreak's origin site, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in a very thin section of human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than its binding to SARS-CoV S protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as severe as SARS-CoV infections in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded with orf3b and proteins secreted with orf8 codes.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b protein may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human cryo-EM structure of ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has both open and closed conformations, is composed of dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which is evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be used as a therapeutic target in drug filtering to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Host and intermediate
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are transmitted to humans by foxes and camels respectively.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be explained.
Ji, et al. propose snakes as the carrier of viruses from bats to humans involving the recombination of homologs within S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that the tick, a long-snouted ant-eating mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine, could potentially be an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology to CoVs found in ticks and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across the genome is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results as to concrete evidence have yet to be obtained (Fig. 3).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectants containing chlorine, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively inactivate the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this novel virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).4).
In general, after invading a host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces inflammatory factor expression, dendritic cell maturation, and the synthesis of interferon type I (IFN) which limits viral spread and accelerates phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV may help the virus evade an immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joined in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complement, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies is also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system produces large amounts of locally produced free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by cluster headaches, is more common in older adults with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune system is compromised have a higher chance of infection than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, show that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine times based on the most accurate incubation period to prevent infected, but asymptomatic, people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, wheezing, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients develop dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's disease progresses rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who develop fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormal pulmonary imaging, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, a study of family clusters and a study of clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic individuals.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients require ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with a higher MERS-COVID-19 mortality.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were shown as major symptoms and ventilation support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
By comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study as of June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only in the range of 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
The figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as high as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Clustering initials are often found within a family or from a group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with an infected person or patient within the last two weeks before the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients discharged from hospital may carry the virus again.
In the early stages, the patient has a normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes a lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin increased in the blood of some patients, as did C-reactive protein and blood clotting rates in most patients.
In severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, increase, and the lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
Thoracic photoabnormalities are found in the majority of COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral clouding or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbate the gas exchange disorder.
Pneumocyte dysfunction of type I and type II decreases surfactant levels and increases surface pressure, which decreases the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings on chest X-rays often parallel the most severe rates of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte desquamation, hyaline membrane formation, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multiple syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is important and a must in making an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group described the protocol for using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipping stick in less than one hour without requiring complex instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique could greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors primarily offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying out a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).2).
These include existing therapies and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the major threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a thermodified cardiopulmonary short-circuit technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening respiration.
In addition, the care of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ function are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
An overreaction of the immune system is known to cause a cytokine storm in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are the primary cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is important in the management of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to manage cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of T cell-directed immune responses; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Conversely, steroids can cause severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affect prognosis.
However, short-term administration of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses is recommended to be administered with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided the compound to China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
These interactions with other medicinal products used by the patient should be closely monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
There is a long history of collecting the blood of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who have the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
Indeed, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, recognize molecules unique to pathogens, and immediately neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to apply such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Blood antibody concentrations are usually low and large amounts of plasma are needed to treat critically ill patients.
Developing and producing specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify the genetic code that makes effective antibodies or filters effective antibodies against proteins important for the virus.
This way, we can easily scale up antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect largely depends on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, as effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not yet exist, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China that used TCM at 87% of their patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM only at about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rates (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as number and severity of patients, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) therapy alone with combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time it took for body temperature to recover, for symptoms to go away, and for hospitalization to be significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM alone group.
More impressively, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% vs 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% vs 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still awaiting better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or their combination, if possible.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients feel very fearful of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely, and angry.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of therapy such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor disorders, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide, were reported.
Mandatory contact history tracking and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, and people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with one another.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from the reservoir of infected animals and humans to a vulnerable host and often complement antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by the emergence of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop a S-protein-based vaccine, which in the long term and effectively creates a protective neutralising antibody and/or immunity against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in elderly and lethal challenge models and its protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before clinical studies begin.
This is probably because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic and cluster cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that is safe and effective for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, these difficulties are not easily overcome due to the long time to develop a vaccine (average of 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoVs.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has also been associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the establishment of disease prognosis models is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor in the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs in 30-65 year olds with 47.7% of patients over 50 years in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care tend to have co-morbidities and complications and are significantly older than patients not requiring intensive care (median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the final outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to infect men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are at greater risk of acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events are also a leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is noteworthy that age and underlying illness are closely correlated and can influence one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
A correlation between CRP levels and severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the final outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest photos and temporal clinical symptom progression should be considered along with other factors to predict the end result and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease end up with avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered from extreme stress as they had to undergo prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which creates great difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is believed to occur when patients are severely ill and most do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, major efforts are underway in China, which include quarantine of Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of cutting off SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new cases has decreased, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates say the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian research team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-concussion and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and returned from hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the re-identified virus could be a recurrent episode, similar to influenza.
Nevertheless, promising signs are emerging in China, when viewed based on the declining number of new cases, which suggest that the current strategy may be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases with half as many deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can finally be controlled.
It is also possible that, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakened its ability to infect and eventually disappeared or became a less pathogenic virus that could coexist with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Fig. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is most easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be transmitted through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in feces, raising the possibility of a new transmission, fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even people who may have had casual contact with the patient or infected person.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serial number 1860s) that help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent spit from potentially infected people from being airborne or attached to a material surface, where spit can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both measuring about 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (serial number 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health-care providers should also wear translucent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
A three-foot distance is believed to be appropriate to maintain distance from the patient.
These measures are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus for the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should be a major wake-up call for China which has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the population by saying that the new virus has a low transmission and limited human-to-human reproductive capacity and prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
This message greatly calmed public fears, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, making this critical time too late to contain the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The Chinese disease control agency should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, the agency should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinic rather than waiting for an official report from a doctor or authorized officer; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain the potential epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to placate the public; and (4) issue more frequent and effective targeted exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and periodically test and improve public response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a novel virus SARS-CoV-2 that began spreading in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and to more than 50 countries worldwide at the time of writing this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has the appearance of a recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial for curbing epidemics and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in older people than younger people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are severely ill. This makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA assays to screen for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered may again test positive for the virus.
This finding greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues remain to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the 96% genetic homology found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two bat-like SARS-CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal acts as an intermediate species to transmit the virus from its original host, say a bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number one and two, we can't effectively stop transmission and the outbreak can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical origin suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does a virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?
Will this pandemic become a worldwide pandemic, end up like SARS, or recur periodically like the flu?
The answers to these and many other questions are important, but they may take time to find.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible so that we can return to normal life.
Zoonotic origin of the human corona virus
Over thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation and revealed how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought the CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with its high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its sibling, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease, so understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will be beneficial to us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs have also been identified.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
Investigation of CoV-host interactions in animals may also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted the HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and recombination of the genome.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host transition and the implications of viral evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is composed of a group of single-stranded, membrane-bound, sensory-positive RNA viruses.
It has the largest genome at 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses, which are called "CoVs", due to their crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Based on their structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that have similar arrangements.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two overlapping large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the replication polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes the bulge or spike (S), sheath or envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complement proteins specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among those four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoVs and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while poultry are the primary reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung organs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the saliva of a cold patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, it was widely accepted that HCoV infections were generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a death rate of roughly 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to various other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), hereinafter referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all had zoonotic origins from bats, mice, or pets.
There is ample evidence supporting the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoVs adapt well and are nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers, and limiting factors of trans-species migration.
The study may also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediates, and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in preventing future spread.
In this review, we provide an overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
We specifically highlighted and discussed the general topic that HCoV parent viruses are normally nonpathogenic in their natural reservoir, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to new hosts.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoVs that increased transmissibility is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the saliva of a cold-affected patient, various CoVs had been isolated from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cattle, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibit cold symptoms, which include headache, sneezing, lethargy, and sore throat, accompanied by fever and cough seen in 10~20% of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultures and sequence series pathways in the mammalian brain.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears similar to that of infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and are most likely to be transmitted during winter in temperate climates.
Typically, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by a sick period of about two weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild cold.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems show severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, which were spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from super-contagious, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load seen on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, numbness, and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough, and shortness of breath as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Damage to alveolar diffusion, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also become infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of patient zero who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a huge effort has been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially most common in children, the elderly, and the infirm with respiratory illnesses.
Choriosis, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, the virus has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and peaks in occurrence in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
These four community HCoVs have all adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into highly pathogenic disease.However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, such as in the case of the more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtype that was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally, when the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself in humans is acquired, the virulence and pathogenicity of these HCoVs also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to the clinical manifestations of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also have acute renal failure, which so far has only occurred in MERS among diseases caused by HCoVs.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high case fatality rate, which is 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most fearsome viruses known to humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross case fatality rate of 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while the death rate outside Hubei was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhoea has also been found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their high nucleotide sequence homology, at 82%, they both group into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects have been reported and may be contributing to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and differentiating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of the disease journey of HCoVs are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show a more general picture seen in Community HCoV infections, which include mild nonspecific or even symptom-free symptoms.
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe COVID-19 cases may look like SARS-CoV infections although at a slightly lower rate.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also exhibits interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities to community HCoVs as well as SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community HCoVs.
On the other hand, the decreased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 after some pathways in humans still needs to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from faecal samples.
"Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, remains to be clarified by further studies".
It is also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoVs.
However, the picture of SARS-CoV-2, which includes its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and continued spread in several pathways to humans, will have a significant impact on the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoVs and humans may be primitive HCoV pandemic surviving species.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans who develop severe disease have been wiped out.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations to fight off host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs have circulated in the human population and triggered the common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
This virus doesn't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and their transmission in humans is not preventable.
They must defend themselves and breed in zoonotic reservoirs as well as seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplification.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar traits to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is as easily transmitted as community HCoVs, at least for now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoVs and is not pathogenic to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir animal host or intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplifying HCoV hosts.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoVs if they have a closely related ancestor and share high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestor virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host carries HCoVs continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for the HCoV or parent virus.
Conversely, if a new HCoV enters an intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
These intermediate hosts can serve as zoonotic sources of human infection and act as amplifying hosts by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate, then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can become statically infected if they cannot maintain transmission in an intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that zero SARS cases have a history of contact with game.
Further seroprevalence studies indicated that the animal sellers had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Moon foxes (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs at live animal markets were the first to be identified carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the foxes in the market were killed.
However, it was reported that foxes from the wild or farms not exposed to such live animal markets mostly tested negative for SARS-CoV. This suggests that foxes may only act as intermediate amplifying hosts, but not natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that it is possible that many small mammal species also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these hosts appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
Further search for natural animal hosts for SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called Rhinolopus bat CoV related to SARS-HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horse-tooth bats.
The bat tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This CoV and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study laid the foundation for a new concept that bats were hosts to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat faeces samples was shown to use bat, fox, and human ACE2 as a receptor to enter cells.
Interestingly, the serum of a convalescent SARS patient can neutralize WIV1.
By far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the entry pathway for the virus.
The RNA polymerase-RNA-dependent sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to its counterpart in the beta-CoVs of bats identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bat share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be direct reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arabian camels show seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as do Middle Eastern camels in some African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swab of the Arabian camel. This further indicates that the camel is the actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with usually mild symptoms was observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral decay from bats.
However, questions remain unanswered as many confirmed MERS cases have no history of camel contact prior to onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or an unknown route of transmission involving an unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2, unless a nearly identical bat CoV is discovered at a later date.
It is likely that the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 intermediates are among the wildlife species sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.Many early cases of COVID-19 are associated with this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences suggest that a group of small endangered mammals, known as the trunks (Manis javanica), may also carry an ancestral beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of the new trout CoV shares 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoVs are as closely related to RaTG13 with a 90% similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RaTG13 are much more different, although the level of homology of the whole genome sequence is higher.
Previous studies in sick trout also reported the detection of contig virus from lung samples, which also turned out to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different editing methods and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence consisting of about 86.3% of the complete viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of truffles being one of the animal intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 comes directly from truffles due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV relatives of truffles.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is actually closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, truffles, and other mammals has yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 triangulum-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the whole genome sequence level.
It is too speculative to say that the high degree of similarity between RBD beta-CoVs of the SARS-CoV-2 family of truffles and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The opposing hypothesis supports recombination between the beta-CoVs of the SARS-CoV-2 relatives of truffles and RaTG13 in third wild animal species.
As a driving factor of evolution, recombination occurs widely among beta-CoVs.
Researchers are still undecided about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It is reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-colored bats shows close affinity to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with the Camelidae also thought to be its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge of the known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from cattle to infect humans, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
In between, there's the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have been in contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the contrary, humans have had close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat-alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca-alpha-CoVs cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoVs are not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is that while bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene carrier of HCoV-229E, alpacas and Arabian camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arabian camels and from Arabian camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at the initial identification of the virus and was also strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rich breeding ground for interspecies genetic fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, tightly-knit colonies, close social interaction, and strong flight are all favorable conditions for bats to be ideal 'virus carriers.'
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arabian camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable, natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Sporadic transmission to humans occurs by chance and humans remain the final hosts for MERS-CoV as transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of truffles, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the truffle beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in truffles.
The eels may be the final host for SARS-CoV-2 relatives beta-CoVs, similar to the foxes in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be accounted for or ruled out.
First, bats could be a reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2 relatives that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the truffle could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts for the newly introduced SARS-CoV-2 relatives.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and eating game.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys in pets and wildlife need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in third species that have come into contact with either bats or truffles.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important to facilitate CoVs crossing the species barrier.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered medium to high with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per footprint, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to a new host.
CoVs have a corrective exoribonuclease, a deletion that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutation of CoVs is about a million times higher than the rate of mutation of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoV has not adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoVs which have a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2's mutation rate is actually lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts that are closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has adapted to Arabian camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will quickly render vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs frequently change templates at random during RNA replication through a unique select-copy mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, strand transitions often occur during transcription of CoV RNA.
Completely homologous RNA and highly homologous subgenomic RNA can undergo recombination to form new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and fox SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is suspected to undergo rapid adaptation in a variety of hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and becomes an intensive target of the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors as the entry pathway for the virus.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, foxes, rats, and raccoon dogs, thus allowing for interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human and fox virus isolates in RBD and 4 of these were located in receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Fox SARS-CoVs have K479N and S487T mutations in their RBD, which may increase the affinity of prothrombin protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be crucial for the virus' adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein implies that the binding affinity of S protein to human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed that the binding affinity of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein was 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also important to know whether there are other coreceptors that may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-therasethylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after interspecies transmission from its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also governed by other host dependence and restriction factors.
This difference in host protein between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over host dependence factors and break down host restriction factors to be successful in interspecies transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important virus-host interaction domain have yet to be identified and characterized.
Unbiased whole genome screening to look at host-dependent and host-constraining factors of SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be useful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bat CoVs gives a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the bat CoV serves as the gene carrier of the HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein marker gene could potentially drastically modify the phenotype of the virus.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because isolated SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been found to encode a wide variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a characteristic deletion of 29 nucleotides was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that favors host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombinant regions identified in RNA polymerase-dependent RNA.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partially nsp14.
Similarly, recombination events between different lineages were shown to occur in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arabian camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may play a role in unintended changes to the viral genome, most likely caused by the release of the virus from the selection pressure it experiences, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to deletion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 is observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoVs show single nucleotide insertion resulting in skeletal displacement.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs was also driven by selection pressures in their reservoir hosts.
Mild or no symptoms are detected when a bat is infected with CoV, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoV and bat.
It seems bats adapt well to the CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of proinflammatory responses in bats would efficiently lower CoV-induced pathology.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receptors and low levels of expression of the major class I complex histokompatibility molecule.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the bat's high metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and influence correction by exoribonucleases thus putting selection pressure on the production of highly pathogenic virus strains upon entry into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or features of proteins for host adaptation.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
The CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret lies of the presence of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to over-activation of the immune response and cytokine storms, with lung damage becoming more severe if the immune response becomes stronger.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is independent of the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy to disentangle immune responses may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
For this reason, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by MCC950 may be beneficial in the management of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoVs that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also bat CoVs that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although foxes and other animals in the market were found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been found.
Trilobite beta-CoVs that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that trilobite may serve as one of the intermediate hosts or trilobite beta-CoVs may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still questionable, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or accidentally.
The CoV has returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoVs in human transmission.
There is ample evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and foxes in wet markets, it is possible that the closure of wet markets and the killing of all foxes in them effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, truffles should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several truffle beta-CoV lineages that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans through truffles and other mammals remains to be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arabian camels for a long time.
The camel served as an important means of transportation and as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local people.
Arab camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to kill all camels to control MERS, as we did at the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can eliminate the virus, a new genotype can emerge and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, the potentially zoonotic bat CoVs are very diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China had to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans must be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since time immemorial.
These viruses stay in their natural reservoir until there's a chance for spread.
Although bats have many traits that favor the spread of viruses, the chances of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are instructed to stay away from wild animals.
Continued surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to keep their distance from the ecological niche of the natural reservoir of the zoonotic virus.
Some pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 ancestor viruses to truffles, the conditions when bats and truffles share an ecological niche are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans come into contact with bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as a true intermediate host, the way that mammal interacts with other species, including humans, bats, and truffles, must be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infection and surveillance should be conducted.
Whether it is a bat, a trunk, or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical host virus may be identified in its natural host in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating of diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 is needed
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and management of the new 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus infection. This guide is based on our experience and serves as a good reference for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also continually updated.
In this letter, we respond to one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases based on the Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted much attention since its publication.
However, it is important to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also continually updated.
As an example, the Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the commission has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts having been substantially modified.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., who introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case a combination of one epidemiological history picture with two clinical manifestations is required to make a comprehensive analysis, or three clinical manifestations are required if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infectious case (positive for a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with clusters of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a small area, such as a home, office, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte counts in the early stages of onset.
Diagnosing a confirmed case should be based on suspected cases with either of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire virus genome sequence showing high homogeneity for the known novel coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM-specific antibodies and IgG-specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change in SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or a titer increased ≥4 fold in the recovery phase above the rate in the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acids in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenicity detection on blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the researchers' ongoing research to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood drawings, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the inclusion of positive results of specific antibodies into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is growing evidence that reminds us to be vigilant with patients with mild and asymptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as low risk.
Scoring systems also need to be verified in practice and in future clinical studies.
In closing, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to comment.
For diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases, we recommend following and adhering to the latest country guidelines.
Our team will also update our guidelines periodically to assist.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on that day.
This is the highest death toll in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported the number of recorded infections included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying at home.
There are 17 deaths in total.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years of age, two cases between 51 and 60 years of age, and one case between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transportation would be stopped for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The public transportation shutdown has been in place since March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on 8 March, in two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men were cured.
SARS-CoV-2 infections exceed one million worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country was one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States (US), there are more than 244,000 reported cases of the coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries are announcing stricter measures to curb the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the territorial quarantine until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens will continue to be paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extends curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all day; previously, it was only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended its curfew until May 1.
Stores in Australia lowered the purchase limit for toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian retail chains Woolworth's and Coles respectively lowered the purchase limit of toilet paper to two and one pack per transaction across all stores nationwide.
ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit, on Monday.
The restrictions were announced as messages at the cashier and on his Facebook page.
Buyers reportedly stockpiled supplies out of fear of COVID-19 if the community had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
The change follows the four-pack per transaction restriction previously imposed by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
In its March 8 media statement, Coles reported that with the imposition of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out within an hour of delivery", calling the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales "surged" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the number allowed to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stock for special Wednesday promotional activities available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local government agency restrictions on truck delivery times made it difficult.
He anticipated higher production costs, as suppliers struggled to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to early stock clearance, some stores could not hold Wednesday specials.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores fill up every night.
He emphasizes that toilet paper is a bulky item that is low in supply and, when sold out, leaves a lot of empty space on the shelves making the shortage of items more noticeable.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there are plenty of items on the shelves, if products like toilet paper and sanitary napkins can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, panic may be minimized, says Russell Zimmerman of ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, stress they are working 24/7 to keep supplies running, according to News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to first-time bidders at auctions in Melbourne, as fewer auctions were held as buyers took a break for the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores are actually reluctant to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia's report on March 3, saying they have no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitary towels, dry food, hand soap, and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British online supermarket Ocado was observed to limit the purchase of Andres towel to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak of the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to how far the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, address, isolate, and mobilize their people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
We are very concerned both about the alarming rate of spread and severity and about the alarming rate of slowdown.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
"Apart from influenza, no respiratory virus has ever been traced from its emergence to its ongoing global spread", he said, in a note published by CNN in February.
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus".
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows a decision by the WHO in January declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the epidemic, "it's basically going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a World Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have been cured.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, and closing facilities.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, the suspension or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, sports activities, and widespread shortages of supplies of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been closed both nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people with East and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance, and people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is suspected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is related to the bat coronavirus, the shingle coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and the person had no apparent connection to the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case traceable to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was likely the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with people aged 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocol.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made it an official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was expected to be greater than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number is likely 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are cured.
For those who did not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death ranged from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official COVID-19 pandemic death count generally refers to people who died testing positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, given that official figures likely do not include people who died without being tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the announced death toll] is lower than the actual number", a statement reinforced by non-scientific reports of undercounting in the U.S. Overcounting often occurs in pandemics, such as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy respectively.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
The number varies by region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate to cases globally was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This figure varies by region.
In China, the estimated death rate per case decreased from 17.3% (for people with onset of symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who died from a particular disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this forecast range is consistent with the results of the first randomized trial for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on the CFR forecast.
WHO has confirmed that the pandemic is under control.
The peak and end of the duration of this outbreak are unclear and may vary by location.
"Even when unchecked, infectious outbreaks usually go flat and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts", states Maciej Boni of Penn State University.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at present as to when that will happen".
Senior medical adviser to the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan argued that "the outbreak may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for up to one or two years".
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraints and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, because it is so easily transmitted, can disappear completely" and the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
Recurrent virulence will depend on herd immunity and mutation rate.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory sputum (phlegm), loss of smell, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, depressed or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and blueness of the face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are in close contact with a confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and screened to ensure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days.For example, the uncertainty estimate of the number of COVID-19 patients who lose their sense of smell initially is 30%, then decreases to 15%.
Details of how the disease spreads are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur mainly at close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that an uncovered cough can cause drip droplets to push up 15 to 27 feet (4.5 to 8.2 meters).
Some researchers speculate that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that persist longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Respiratory droplets may also be produced when exhaling, including when speaking, although these viruses are not generally transmitted through the air.
The droplet may fall into the mouth or nose of someone nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can convert respiratory secretions into aerosols and then disperse them through the air.
Spread can also occur when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms become apparent and at a later stage of the disease.
People test positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests transmission may occur before significant symptoms appear.
Few asymptomatic case reports have been laboratory-confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by exposure to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the early SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains of bat derivatives.
The virus has a 96% similarity at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the shingles virus and the human virus.
To date, genome-wide comparisons have found at most 92% genetic material similarity between the shingle coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that shingles are intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is eventually made through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected secretions or blur CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first circulated on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on a breath sample or a blood sample.
Results are generally available within hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab may also be used.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests have been shown to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) in people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because of overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less specific for infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to consider it as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging features with X-rays and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands thoroughly, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and using a tissue when coughing or sneezing and discarding the tissue directly in the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical restrictions are also recommended to prevent transmission.Governments in various regions have restricted or called for stopping all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community-scale spread in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected.Health care providers who treat people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other phones.
Furthermore, users will receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, rinsing the nose and rinsing the throat with a mouthwash are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after passing a nosebleed, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that destroys its protective coating.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60% by volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure disinfectant for stainless steel surfaces), including ethanol 6271%, isopropanol 50100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.27.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or daycare centers, all areas such as offices, restrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by patients, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or use a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and immediately discard the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the respiratory droplets that are dispersed when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face with unhygienic hands, which is a major source of transmission".Masks are also recommended for people caring for others who may have the disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people caring for COVID-19 patients, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks for members of the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face masks made of cloth.China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy populations, especially when in close proximity (1 meter (3 feet or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends the wearing of surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit their citizens from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the stores to wear a face mask.
Israel asks all its citizens to wear face masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear face masks as of April 1.
Panama mandates the use of face masks whenever outdoors, and recommends the manufacture of homemade face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) is an infection control measure intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restraint methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments mandate or call for social restrictions in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, from 250 people (if COVID-19 is not known to be spreading in an area) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings in public areas involving more than two people. Elderly people and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems who are at higher risk of serious illness and complications are advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in community-level outbreak areas. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to change the use of the term "social distancing" to "physical distancing", to make clear that the goal is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social contact, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social restrictions" conveys the impression that people should isolate themselves completely socially and not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
These recommendations include encouraging sex only with people who live with you and do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Home isolation is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments require or recommend self-quarantine for the entire population living in the affected area.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for people who belong to high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread COVID-19 spread are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies in epidemic control are containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
containment is carried out at the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people and take other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of disease, further efforts move to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and communities.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproductive rate to less than 1. Part of the management of an outbreak of infectious disease is to try to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overload on healthcare and gives more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Nonpharmaceutical interventions to address the outbreak include individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community-level measures aimed at physical restrictions, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gatherings; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and community-level measures, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also implemented various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass censorship and local quarantines, and issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to infected people who self-quarantine and imposes heavy fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and punished medical stockpiling.Simulations for the UK and the US showed that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) had major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and a overwhelming health system.
Suppression is optional, but needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is achieved first), because otherwise, transmission will rebound rapidly when suppression measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain pandemics have social and economic impacts.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, which include testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking enough water, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
Steroid use can worsen the patient's condition.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental step in the response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and WHO's European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care to redirect resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, if possible cancelling elective procedures, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care capacity by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei was gradually increasing.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.A cluster of pneumonia with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who notified the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital told their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the other, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for issuing the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and informed WHO.
A fair number of unknown cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which then triggered an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, fueled by migration during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and rail transit point.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
Further official data showed that 6,174 people had developed symptoms as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restrict free movement and establish border controls.
The national response includes containment measures, such as quarantine (known as a stay-at-home order, shelter-in-place order, or area quarantine) and curfews.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in some form of area quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million people were in area quarantine in the Philippines, about 59 million people were in area quarantine in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in area quarantine in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of regional quarantine, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later, which is about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates the earliest case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26; this observation was reported by his hospital to Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of a patient sample on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public announcement was released by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was notified the same day.
When this notice was issued, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by Communist Party of China general secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In a quarantine dubbed "the largest in human history", a cordon sanitaire was announced on 23 January to stop travel in and out of Wuhan, and was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited within the city.
The Lunar New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.

For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all international tourists entering the city.On 23 March, the only mainland Chinese case was transmitted domestically five days earlier, in this case through a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been basically blocked and the outbreak was under control in China.
Travel restrictions on the same day were relaxed in Hubei, except from Wuhan, two months after the territorial quarantine was imposed.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, without giving specific details on when this policy would expire.

On 30 March, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provided a monetary stimulus package for enterprises.The State Council declared a day of mourning by beginning a three-minute national silence on 4 April at 10:00 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online with due regard to physical restrictions to avoid a new COVID-19 outbreak.
On 20 January 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the state health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to a gathering of a new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among 9,336 churchgoers, 1,261 or about 13% had reported symptoms.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases are under quarantine after testing confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
South Korea introduced what is considered the world's largest and best-organized program to screen the virus in the population, isolate any infected people, and track and quarantine those who come into contact with them.
Screening methods include the obligation to self-report symptoms by people newly arriving from abroad through mobile apps, cross-sectional or drive-thru virus testing with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to more than 20,000 people daily.
The South Korean program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire city.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for President Moon's impeachment for their claims that the government had made mistakes in handling the outbreak, or, conversely, praising the president's reaction.
On 23 March, South Korea was reported to have the lowest single-day total cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.

According to a WHO official, there are likely five times as many cases in Iran as reported.
It was also stated that US sanctions against Iran could affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for economic sanctions to be eased for countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.

A CNN report said that what contributed to the high fatality rate was a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test everyone infected with the virus.
Initially, the United Kingdom's response to the virus was one of the most lax among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any social restrictions or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being perceived as less responsive and less intense in responding to public concerns.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement calling for a halt to all non-essential travel and social contact and advised people to work from home, if possible, and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational venues, such as pubs and fitness centres, should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis.

However, the United States was slow to begin testing, obscuring the true outbreak rate at the time.
Testing was hampered by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-governmental testing kits (by academics, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for testing until early March (doctor's orders required after that).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.

WHO praised the Chinese government's efforts in managing and containing the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of a cover-up that hampered prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "giving routine updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in reaction to the central government's decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that although the measure was "clearly not a WHO recommendation", it was also "a very important indication of a commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and he called it "unprecedented in the history of public health".On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth such measure since it was first introduced during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared because of the "risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have adequate health systems.
In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that unnecessarily disrupt international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community to contribute $675 million that will be used to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support countries that "do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus if an outbreak occurs".
Further, Tedros made a statement that "the limits of our strength are at the weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later".In a press conference on 11 February, WHO designated COVID-19 as the disease name for the virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide a "response in the form of a deployment of the full force of the UN system".
Later, the UN activated the Crisis Management Team to allow for the coordination of the entire UN response, which according to WHO would allow them to "focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to address the impact of the outbreak in the broader social, economic, and developmental areas".
On 14 February, a WHO-led Joint China Mission Team was activated; the team aims to provide international and WHO expertise in China to assist in domestic management and evaluate "severity and transmission rates" by holding workshops and meetings with relevant national-level agencies and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of countryside and county-level response activities, including urban and rural order".On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world needs to do more to prepare for the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic" and said that, although it is too early to call it a pandemic, countries should remain "in the preparedness phase".
In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation.On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the coronavirus threat at the global level would be raised from "high" to "very high", which is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergency program, warned that, "It is time for every government on the planet to face reality: Wake up.
The virus may come to your place and you must be prepared", and urged that appropriate countermeasures can help the world avoid "the worst".
Further, Ryan stated that current data does not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration means "we basically accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to the virus".
On 11 March, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned by the alarming rate of spread and severity, as well as the alarming rate of slowness to act".WHO received sharp criticism for its inadequacy in managing the pandemic, which included delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.

The Chinese government has received criticism from the United States, the Cabinet Office Minister of Great Britain Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, for its handling of the pandemic that began in Hubei province, China.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed over their handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions in dealing with the epidemic in the region.
Some commentators believe that the move is meant to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected previous acknowledgments that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories that COVID-19 originated in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's cover-up gave the virus a boost that has now turned into a global pandemic". This was eventually criticized by some critics as racism and "distracting from the failure of his administration to deal with the coronavirus".
The Daily Beast got a message from the US government outlining a communications strategy and it clearly came from the National Security Council, with the strategy being quoted as "All about China.
We were told to try and get this message across in any way possible, including press conferences and appearances on television".Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda drive to influence the world.
The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was a "geo-political component, which includes a battle for influence through reversal of facts and 'politics of generosity.'"
Borrell also said that, "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, they are a responsible and reliable partner".
China has also called for the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
There are also reported mask disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has taken hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China responded bilaterally.
This is not a good sign of European solidarity, of course".
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin mobilized Russian troops to send military medical personnel, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of carrying out a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charade.
Lombardy's President, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to colleagues in the US, [Putin] assumed that if US manufacturers of medical equipment and materials were given a chance, they would also be able to retaliate if necessary".
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Secretary-General Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, these exercises are not only endangering the lives of US troops and many European countries participating, but also the populations of the countries where they operate".The Iranian government has been hit particularly hard by the virus, with about two dozen lawmakers infected along with fifteen current or former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country was having difficulty fighting the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran.

In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and general elections, and punish people suspected of spreading false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed on supply shortages, which stemmed from increased use of equipment globally to fight the outbreak, panic purchases, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increasing consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Some areas also experience panic buying that results in a shortage of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, which triggers a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the tech industry has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a four to six-month delay in the supply of medical supplies.
It also causes a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas are avoiding food shortages.
Measures by China and Italy to combat the illegal stockpiling and trafficking of essential products have been successful in preventing the anticipated acute food shortages in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food racks were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials released pork stockpiles to ensure the public's nutrition.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which require food manufacturers to store reserves for emergencies like this.

This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to the mall in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession caused by the pandemic could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase by between 14 and 22 million people compared to a situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are either stranded at home in the inland province or trapped in Hubei province.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis's forecast, the coronavirus outbreak could cause 47 million job losses in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Territorial quarantines in India have caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) to be unemployed.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and Britain.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and self-employed.
Organizations in the arts and cultural sector seek to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of employees and the community, and support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions are closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another adverse impact of this new and rapidly growing disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which fall on the last week of the Christian conversion season of Lent, were canceled.
Many dioceses encourage Christian elderly to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, live online broadcasts or television, while others offer drive-in or floor-to-ceiling worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the emptying of St. Peter's Square of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and later closed places of worship, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but no later than summer 2021". Worldwide, casinos and other gaming venues were closed and live poker tournament broadcasts were delayed or cancelled.
This has caused many gamblers to switch to online gambling, many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new registrations.
Many big theaters like Broadway also postponed all shows.
Artists are exploring ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live online concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are circulating online with many people turning to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) noted racist sentiment expressed in groups around the world that the Chinese deserved to receive the virus or receive what they claimed was their fair share of rewards.
Some countries in Africa are also experiencing a rise in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their local origin.
There is already support for Chinese people, both online and offline, and for people in the affected areas.
Following the spread of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia.Residents in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to ban Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States report increased rates of racial harassment and assault.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus the "Chinese Virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China, and study in major Indian cities are reported to have experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that is why God is taking vengeance on them".
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "confusing".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents flared up due to the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers that use paid blocking have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to epidemics available in open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results quickly on a pre-print server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for the coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
These tests are used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have been infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
Accurate disease mortality rates and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from these test results.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was wide variation in the number of tests that countries had done.
This variability may also significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be overstated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Usually, results are available within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on throat swabs are only reliable in the first week of illness.
Eventually, the virus can disappear in the throat while it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested at week two, sample material may be taken from the internal airway using a suction catheter or material expelled through cough (sputum) may be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed at Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and constitutes at least 250,000 test kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed testing on 23 January 2020.A South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detector (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
The device searches for the "E" gene that all beta coronaviruses have, and the RdRp gene that is specific for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detector.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 (2019-nCoV) New Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests on the old version of the test kit gave inconclusive results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that were state and local laboratories allowed to conduct testing.
The test was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limitations are announced; collection and processing of specimens must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care.On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to be developing a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be done in 3.5 hours at high volume so that one machine can perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for testing which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses non-PCR isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology.
Because it does not require a series of temperature cycles, this method can give a positive result in just five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates increasing production to produce 50,000 tests per day.Tests using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the nucleocapsid (N-protein) protein of the novel coronavirus are being developed in Taiwan, with the hope of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes like rapid influenza tests.
A literature review published in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic imaging has little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be present before the onset of symptoms".
Typical features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation form as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the current pandemic origin point showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals as early as 7 days after onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this test, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is generally used, although a series of specimens may be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a single peripheral blood sample obtained through a skin puncture is generally used.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required prior to examination.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 agencies that provided notice to the agency as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
It's capable of testing up to several hundred samples in a matter of hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR testing for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody tests it had purchased were good enough to be used.
Hong Kong devised a scheme for suspected patients to stay at home, "the emergency department would give a specimen tube to the patient", they spat into it, sent it back, and obtained test results a few moments later. NHS England announced that the NHS was pioneering a home suspected case testing scheme to eliminate the risk of patients infecting others if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect an ambulance if used.
The testing center has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and largest testing of any country.On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany had a capacity of around 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient order and 10,700 tests had been conducted in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is ordered by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a floor test was offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown as only positive results have been reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including the week of 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, combining samples and only testing further if the combined sample was found to be positive.In Wuhan, a 2,000-square-meter emergency detection laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in Indonesian) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling shows that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity is not available.
Wuhan's lab was soon followed by Huo-Yan's labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day.The open-source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.This balanced design can be run in a small laboratory without the need for robotic fluid handling.
As of March, shortages and insufficient reagents had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers have been exploring a sample preparation protocol that involves heating a sample at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing.On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates was reportedly conducting more coronavirus tests per capita than any other country, and was ready to scale up testing to reach a larger portion of the population.
This was achieved through a combination of land-based testing and the purchase of population-scale mass-produced laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various test prescriptions targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German recipe for the production of test kits that were sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own.
The German prescription was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January thus slowing down testing available in the US. At the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with test kit reliability; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test kit to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts.
Instead, experts say that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built up within a few years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests pending in US private laboratories, and the supply of wipes and chemical reagents becoming critical.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems on their test equipment.
In the United States, a test kit developed by the CDC was "flawed"; the government later removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by private companies.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or use the test equipment correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test kit be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kit that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and they did not "use it".The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that the test kit could not be used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of the person tested positive and tracing of the person who came into contact with the person who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive final result.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, about 10 days apart.
About half of the people who test positive have no symptoms, and all cases found are quarantined.
With travel restrictions in place, new infections are being eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is progressing much more slowly than in other developed countries despite the absence of extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time for the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also addressed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive territorial quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower fatality rates, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America, and one in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "% of positive test results" is affected by the country's testing policy.
Countries that test only people in hospitals will have higher positive outcomes than countries that test all of their population, whether they show symptoms or not, by the same other factors.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
People can also catch respiratory illnesses, such as the flu or the common cold, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five critical times throughout the day when it is especially important to wash your hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning your child's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding your child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash hands with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing meals.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing a diaper or cleaning a child who has just used the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronaviruses, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And it reduces the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study showed that increasing hand-washing practices may slightly increase the height of toddlers.
In developing countries, child mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
These simple measures can reduce the mortality rate from the disease by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to handwashing with soap.Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ASIs), as is the subconscious behavior practiced in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, the leading cause of death among infants, is the number one cause of death; it kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making it a habit to wash your hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet could save more lives than any vaccine or medical measure, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage from drying of the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy and scaly skin condition, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Washing your hands too often is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the spread of fecal-oral disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (toilet, bowel), after cleaning the child's ass (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other important times to apply proper hand-washing techniques to prevent disease transmission are before and after treating a wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is still low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practice handwashing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States was near the middle at 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate at 23 percent. Several behavior change methodologies are now available to increase the adoption of the habit of handwashing with soap at critical times.
The Primary Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a scale-up of appropriate measures to support children's health and education.
Twice a year, the administration of antifungal medication, along with daily hand washing with soap and daily fluoride tooth brushing, is at the heart of this national program.
This program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Cleansing of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main job of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic waste, are not easily soluble in water.
However, the cleansing of fats and proteins is aided by adequate water supply.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies examining bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer was unlikely to occur because the bacteria were washed away with foam.
Still, the CDC states that "liquid soaps that are extracted from containers without touching the hands are preferred".
Antibacterial soaps are widely promoted in health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of any recommended antiseptic or disinfectant is better for naturally occurring antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protectors, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (alligator tongue, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that regular soaps are as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
Comfortable warm water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing natural oils that keep away dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect in reducing the number of germs on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol hand sanitizers (also called alcohol-based hand scrubs, antiseptic hand scrubs, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these cleaning agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol which are formulated together with a thickener such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel or together with a moisturizer such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol are an efficient germ killer.
Rubbing alcohol kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol-containing 70% alcohol cyanide kills 99.97% (log 3.5 reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5 reduction) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of the two hands and the sides and ends of all the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing them on both palms.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizing, especially when hands look dirty.
Increased use of sanitizing agents due to ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms; however, sanitizing agents should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rubs are rare.
A lower incidence of causing irritating contact dermatitis is the appeal of this product than washing hands with soap and water.
Although effective, non-water agents do not clean hands of organic matter, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogens are still on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically, these products have performed significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol scrubbers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effect reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ashes or dirt instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that contaminated soil or ashes may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, when in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as alternatives to soap when soap is not available.
Proper handwashing techniques based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommendations for preventing disease transmission include the following steps:
Wet your hands with running warm or cold water.
Running water is recommended because a silent basin may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem to have an effect.
Wipe your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, fingertips, and under your nails.
Soap clears germs from the skin, and studies show that people are more likely to wash their hands thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Brush carefully under the running water.
Washing in the sink can make your hands re-contaminated.
Dry with a dry cloth or let it air dry.
Wet, damp hands are more prone to re-infection, and the areas that are most often missed are the thumb, wrist, interfinger, and under the fingernails.
Flat nails and peeled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, draining water from suspended and perforated syringes or bottles and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries.
Tipping taps are a simple technology that uses a water bottle suspended by a rope, a lever operated by a foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public restrooms.
A growing number of studies show that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Paper industry Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels of paper towels, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194 percent on the fingertips and 254 percent on the palms.
Drying with a jet air dryer caused an increase in total bacteria on average of 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased on average by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential for cross-contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment from each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhausted air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a warm air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with a paper towel.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer is an alternative during travel if soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was made mandatory long after the Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital environments.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of such devices.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gels to soak and rub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed together with fingers tied together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a hairbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in water on the hands, hands need to be thoroughly rinsed and dried with a clean cloth.
Once dry, a sheet of paper is used to turn off the faucet (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids recontamination of the surface's hands.
The purpose of hand washing in health care settings is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("bugs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing is still unacceptable in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a leaflet outlining standards for hand washing and hand rubbing in the healthcare sector.
The WHO hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be viewed on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Times" to wash your hands:
after exposure to blood/bodily fluids
before aseptic duty, and
After treatment of a patient, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicinal" or "antimicrobial" soap) serves to kill handwashing material.
Such a killing function may be desired before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are prevalent. To 'rub' hands before surgery, taps that can be turned on and off without touching are needed, chlorhexidine or iodine washers, sterile cloths to dry hands after washing, and sterile brushes to rub and other sterile instruments to clean under the nails.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbow, usually 26 minutes.
Long rubbing times (10 minutes) are not required.
When rinsing, the water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash or use hand sanitizer before and after handling a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of handwashing came from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefit obtained was very small when handwashing frequency was increased above 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious disease to food than washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison between rubbing hands with an alcohol-based solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each showed that alcohol-based hand rubs reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs at reducing influenza A virus H1N1 and Clostridium difficile spores from hands.Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may involve education for staff on hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents' homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal handwashing a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing faucets near private or public toilets are rare, although options to make cheap handwashing facilities are available.
However, low hand-washing rates may also be due to ingrained habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Encouragement and encouragement to wash hands with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and result in long-term population behavior changes.
To run effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective.[citation needed] One example of encouraging handwashing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is met, the school can move from one star to eventually three stars.
Building handwashing facilities could be part of a campaign to encourage handwashing to reduce childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to achieve the goal of behavior change.
Several studies have examined the effectiveness of overall handwashing costs in developing countries in relation to avoiding Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALYs) or measures of years lost to illness.
One study showed that encouraging handwashing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for those in vulnerable situations, such as a newborn mother or a wounded soldier in a hospital, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the founder of modern nursing" in England.
At the time, many people still believed that infection was caused by a foul odor called miasma, or bad air.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-care-associated infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against the infectious disease.
For example, posters "proper handwashing techniques" are hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing one's hands of" something means to express one's reluctance to take responsibility for something or to participate in something.
The phrase originates in the Bible chapter in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in English society.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands continuously to clean up imaginary stains; an act that shows her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after recalling or reflecting on an unethical action, people are more likely to wash their hands more often and are more likely to value handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, people who were allowed to wash their hands after such meditation were less likely to engage in compensatory "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
The religion commands hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but no soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual hand washing in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Jewish Tevlah and Netilat Yadayim, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims require that people wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims require that people wash their hands before and after eating.
Workplace risk management for COVID-19
Occupational hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodologies to hazard control to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace hazard control depends on the workplace and job assignment, which is based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers; for these jobs, basic infection prevention measures are recommended, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, respiratory ethics, and performing regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Moderate-risk exposures include work that requires close or frequent contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and high volume retail orders.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and providing protective equipment if in contact with COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgues exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Hazard controls appropriate to these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation chambers, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job.
The COVID-19 outbreak may have some impact on the workplace.
Employees may not show up for work because they are sick, need to care for others, or fear possible exposure.
The pattern of trade can change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and the means of obtaining these goods (such as shopping outside rush hour, by delivery, or by landing).
Finally, shipments from geographic areas heavily affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.
The plan considers the level of risk associated with the various workplaces and job tasks, includes sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community order, as well as individual worker risk factors, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls needed to address such risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and plans for the management of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of outbreak control include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the response measures taken.
A hazard control hierarchy is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls based on their effectiveness.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative oversight, and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls include isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policies or procedures that requires action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the hazard to the worker, properly fitted as applicable (e.g., respirators), worn consistently and correctly, inspected, maintained, and replaced regularly, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk exposures work with minimal workplace contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, breathing ethics including covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissue and trash containers, preparing for remote work or work shifts with phased arrival/return times, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and performing regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation from potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking any antipyretic or other symptom-modifying medication, and that sick leave policies be flexible enough to allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk exposures include work that requires close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around the business location, or because someone has recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
Administrative controls for these groups and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making work shifts with phased arrival/departure times, stopping non-essential travel to workplaces experiencing COVID-19, developing emergency communication plans including a forum to address worker concerns, equipping workers with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behavior, training workers on how to wear protective clothing and equipment, providing resources and support to ensure that personal hygiene is maintained and that customers are protected regularly, and possibly limiting access to workplaces, masks, face masks, face masks, and other public safety measures.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If someone becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by 6 feet, assigning a cabin crew member to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated bodily fluids or surfaces and possibly other protective equipment if sick passengers have a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazard bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial voyages, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard control includes postponing travel if sick, self-isolation, and informing the onboard medical center immediately if someone develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the person's quarantine cabin.Despite community spread, for schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in a school building.
If there is community transmission at a minimal to moderate level, social containment strategies may be implemented, which include: cancelling field trips, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating at cafeterias, increasing distance between tables, gradual arrival and departure times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is high transmission in the local community, in addition to social containment strategies, extending school closures may be considered.For law enforcement officers who are performing routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must be in contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 person are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including wearing appropriate protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect belts and work equipment before reuse using household cleaning spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used PPE as well as to control and wash dirty clothing.
OSHA considers certain healthcare workers and morgues to be in the high or very high risk category.
High-risk exposures include health care providers, support, laboratories, and medical transportation personnel exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This job becomes a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
High-risk exposed morgue work includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes at very high exposure risk if the worker performs an autopsy.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
The specimens must be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in different waiting rooms based on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19.In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people who work within 6 feet of patients known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filter face masks or better are to be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes fitness testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.WHO does not recommend full coveralls or coveralls because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at entry points.
For people who take respiratory samples, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective goggles, or face shields, gowns, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the supply of APD is insufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through remote medical services, physical restrictions such as transparent windows, with only people involved in direct care allowed to enter the room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD needed for specific tasks, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

Subject: [Covid-19] Lifting the burden and preparing for the future
The first time I saw you, you were a little bit of a jerk.
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that has made clear the global human connection and the responsibilities we have to each other.
We've never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on a form of empathy, cooperation, and building a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and caring that we've witnessed among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and chats is an extraordinary validation of the extraordinary humanity that we're fortunate enough to work with.
My gratitude and pride are infinite in calling you all my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for the world today to have access to Wikipedia and how powerful it is to make this important resource available online to everyone.
Your job makes this possible, whether you're keeping this site running, helping pay our partners, or helping keep our community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, especially now.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjusting to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C-teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the appropriate response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain the organization's viability during this time.
We're very keen to relieve the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to cut back on your work schedule, that's fine.
To all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more during normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable today, and whether you need to care for a loved one, shop for groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your work hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have to be said, but we said it.
No sick leave or PTO is required, just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that key work areas can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan know in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets proper attention from management.)
The colleagues who are paid hourly will be paid in full.
We've said it, and we'll say it again, to honor our commitment to our contractor partners and hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal working hours when normal circumstances prevail.
This includes if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress into the world around us.
Our work can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work that needs to go on.
SRE, HR Operations, Trust & Security, and the Fundraising team, among others, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus fully on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't do anything for the future.
We don't plan to "work overtime to catch up" after this pandemic is over.
You wouldn't be expected to work overtime to meet these unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the situation is changing and will endeavour to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget so employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and caring for loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work on a shorter schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the current workload and planning stress across the organization.
We'll be submitting our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and team on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you APP team for your leadership on this.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in our San Francisco office.
They used hospital-grade antiviral fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all elevators that access our floors.
The building has implemented its own safety assurance protocols using products that support the occupants' safety.
We were happy to see that the office would be ready when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full remote work order, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues based in NYC know, we're also in talks about renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our longtime remote workers know that it may need some adjustment and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of the meeting to one or two hours at the most.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them into several days.
Define the meeting clearly, make an agenda, and send in the reading material in advance.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and instant connection.
Assign a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor conversations for questions and record lists of speakers, and someone to help make meeting notes (or do collaborative note-taking).
Email technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare payments to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work
The HR Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support the work enhancement distributed throughout the Foundation.
In recent weeks we've asked all community grant recipients to cancel public Wikimedia-funded events, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We let them know that we understand our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete approved grant activities and that no one will be penalized for having to delay or modify such targets.
Next week we'll follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiment of the entire global community seems to be sadness over the disruption, but at the same time relief from clarity and the ability to focus on their own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll be sending out an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep updating this page and ensure all information is in one place.
We also try to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, main workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or anything else that may require assistance, feel free to let CRT know and cooperate.
We're here to help provide support and liaison where needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Global Operations Director of HR International.
Let none of these changes be seen as a neglect of our work and our duty.
Rather, it is an acknowledgment that, at this time, our work and responsibilities may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the world with the services it relies on.
The job we planned for before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for the important work that's coming in the weeks and maybe months ahead.
We need all of you to make it happen, and for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work your best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has opposite activity to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal renal amino acid collectrin transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I single membrane membrane protein, with an enzymatically active domain exposed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes, especially type II lung alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconstrictive angiotensin II.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of S1 proteins in spikes or bulges of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzymes into endosomes located inside the cell.
The virus entry process also requires priming of protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also decreased the risk of pneumonia in patients at higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust compared with the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipoplysarid-induced acute respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours with a 30-minute onset of action plus a 24-hour duration of effect.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with increased angiotensin II in blood circulation.
b'The COVID-19 App is a mobile software application designed to help contact tracing in the face of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, a process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have had contact with an infected person.
Many applications are being developed or proposed, which have received official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questioned, especially with regard to systems based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
Alternatives that do not intrude too much on privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 patients.
It's used in over 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, it's using an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be submitted to the government.North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that a contact tracing app was in the advanced development stage and would be available for deployment in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; this app is designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur with application-based systems, which include false positives and the possibility of ineffectiveness if the data the application captures is limited to a small population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has placed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting them to only "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, specifically about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
The organization sets eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
the extension of monitoring and surveillance shall have a sunset clause;
data use should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance must avoid the increasing discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
meaningful participation of all "relevant stakeholders" is required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the problem of continuous surveillance by removing tracking mechanisms from the device's operating system once they are no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than apps, eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential for significant privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with a central server need to access private location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use a central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system is used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specialized app, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate a text message notification to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made the location information publicly available, which was allowed by extensive changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is publicly available through a number of apps and websites. Countries such as Germany are considering using centralized systems as well as systems that protect privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-protecting contact tracking is an established concept, with a large body of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record a user's proximity to another phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. The decentralized protocols include the Decentralized Privacy Protecting Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Number, CEN), Protocol and Privacy Sensitive Mechanism for Cellular Contact Tracking (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matches take place on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy while collecting and using location or lane intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies and was originally also founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and staff without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups that share a basically similar approach and are a multi-overlapping protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect to achieving wide adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official apps open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be rolled out in three phases:
launch of a tool to allow governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the problem of data collection and continuous surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, then removing it in the same way once the threat passes.
b'Drug repositioning (also called new purpose, new profile, or new drug task or transition therapy) is the use of an approved drug for a new treatment purpose, i.e. for a disease or medical condition that is different from the original purpose of drug development.
This pathway is a line of scientific research currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions.SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that could be drug targets, each protein having multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these ligand binding sites could be the basis of a project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicases, S-proteins, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A, et al. examined several candidate compounds which were then optimized and analyzed for their structural similarity to drugs that had been approved and had the highest similarity to accelerate the development of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in their preclinical studies for recommendation in clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against several autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydrochlorothiazines were two of four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydrochlorothiazine in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorothiazine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized on EUA basis only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
Doctors say they use it when "there's no other choice".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and efficacy trial of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir has been shown to be "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the duration of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency warns the public that the evidence available to support the drug is limited and premature.
On 2 April, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for supply and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration to buy the drug, which may be less effective in cases of severe illness with a virus that has multiplied.
This medicine may not be safe for use by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that no benefit was observed.
This drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify a drug to find a compound that would bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific community about the direction of resources to position a drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection.
One problem with antiviral treatment is that resistance arises through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early trial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, one in people with moderate disease and one in people with severe disease.
There are three clinical trials underway for intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized people with severe COVID-19 disease, two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with pre-symptomatic novel coronavirus infections.
For a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to see the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraception are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients and prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study in 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium at prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention is focused on targeting new treatments to antiviral drugs that were approved and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to 7th edition Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to 7th edition Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics identified as potential drugs that could be given new uses for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antigen): Approved by China.
In addition, trials are also being conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many efforts underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, would not be available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread worldwide in 2020, which resulted in massive investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the published genome to develop a vaccine that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative issued a statement in April that the key considerations in developing a vaccine are speed, production capacity, deployment at the scale needed, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main targets of the platforms moving into Phase I security studies, include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (developer of Phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (developer of Phase I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or under design).
Phase I-II trials conduct initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually conducted randomly, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, while determining more appropriate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates currently under active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" studies).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating a potential molecular-clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune responses.
On 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it had begun developing a vaccine, with a target for human testing in 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is working with its biotech partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on vaccine design with technology similar to that used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On 27 February 2020, Generex subsidiary NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology announced that it had begun a vaccine project to develop a Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Supply Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was partnering with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
Furthermore, the partnership announced plans for preclinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, vaccine development would at least take about one and a half to two years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is currently in laboratory research, with human trials planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'a large sum of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine", which was protested by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, an mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they would have preclinical trial results in April 2020 and that a candidate vaccine that is in the final stages could begin human testing in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with CEPI's total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine reaching US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates on animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
A vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 medical COVID-19 research projects, which include a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a C$192 million dedicated funding for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, in mice; they stated that "MNAs administering SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine induced a potent antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that began to be seen 2 weeks after immunization".
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is engineered to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the diseases they prevent.
A further trial in Australia followed 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that a vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, suggest the need for containment measures to achieve biosafety level 3 in the management of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no drug or vaccine for SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
As MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts fueled conspiracy theories claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known beforehand and that a vaccine was available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured.The virus is mainly transmitted between humans through close contact, often through splashes or small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or while speaking.
Although produced during exhalation, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can survive for up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms appear and after the later stages of the disease.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of having the virus and those who care for them.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not wearing masks, some recommend wearing masks, and some require wearing masks.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, wheezing, or sore throat may be found, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially only had clinical signs of chest tightness and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and is being investigated, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a large viral load.
Talking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can cause droplets to be pushed up to 15 feet (4.5 m).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the United States National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission is possible and that air collectors placed in hallways outside people's rooms produce samples that are positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can convert respiratory secretions into aerosols and then disperse them through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.The virus is most contagious when a person has symptoms; although spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard/cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective when used correctly; soap products break down the protective fat layer of the virus, deactivating the virus, as well as releasing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), were less effective.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All of the features of SARS-CoV-2 are new to the naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which destroys its protective bubbles.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19 as the virus accesses host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lung.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illness.
The high rate of cardiovascular symptoms is due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disruption during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in COVID-19 infected patients in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis.Autopsies in people who died from COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells secreting pathogenic GM-CSF were shown to correlate with recruitment of monocytes secreting inflammatory IL-6 and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsies.
WHO has published several testing protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on a breath sample obtained through a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Usually, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but require two blood samples taken two weeks apart so the results have little time value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate this strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, an antibody test (which can detect active infection and if a person has been previously infected) is under development, but not widely used.
China's experience with such tests shows accuracy of only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods to detect infection based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are commonly found early in infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on the autopsy were:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema is also common.
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and formation of giant cells with many nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: exudate formation in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation disseminated (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if a tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms.Social containment strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large numbers of people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large-scale gatherings in public places.
Restriction guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
There is no known effective drug to prevent COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until early 2021, the main part of dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak epidemic, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, and after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
Furthermore, the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance "is not an active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for managing hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care and pulmonary specialists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals prefer paracetamol (acetaminophen) to ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (APD) during a pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: APD gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized these masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are severe.
A type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people hospitalized, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these methods produces the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to maintain invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of health systems to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital end up in ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators capable of high pressure control mode and PEEP are required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung and pneumothorax injury.
High peep may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried on people with severe illnesses.
The FDA has granted provisional authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is severely or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also notifies local health officials.Data analytics on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to impose quarantine and protect people who may have been in contact with infected residents.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
The Russians are using facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told by cell phone operators that "40% of the population is still moving around".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The rise of social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic downturn are the perfect storm that threatens the mental health and well-being of society".
The disease can be mild with few or no symptoms, which resembles other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are still lacking.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, specifically increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 picture an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in the hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between admission and death.
In one study examining early cases, the median time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
A postmortem histopathological examination of the lung sample showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoid exudate in both lungs.
Cytopathic changes of the virus were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was observed, with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people admitted to hospital have a congenital condition.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
A lack of a mild case count can lead to a death toll being overstated.
However, the fact that the deaths were the result of past cases may mean that the current mortality rate is being calculated too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-convalescence intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.
Immunity is seen to be possible, if other coronavirus behaviours are observed, but there have been reported cases of COVID-19 recovery followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
This case is believed to be a residual infection that worsened, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be naturally occurring and to have originated in animals, through infection spread.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication from WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Generally, several measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the death rate to cases globally was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a particular disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Although not everyone who is infected makes antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 residents, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and it is likely that not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and their mortality rates are different for men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies done in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the difference in risk between men and women only becoming apparent at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact reasons for these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at younger ages than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government did not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female health workers is higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both disease and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov acute respiratory disease as interim names for viruses and diseases in line with 2015 guidelines that called for not using location names in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print healthcare materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was in dire need of ventilator valves, and the supplier could not provide them on the scale needed, a local company re-engineered and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
A vaccine is not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing a vaccine candidate.
Previous research on SARS-CoVs was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under study.
First, researchers aim to make a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, either inactive or dead, aims to rapidly trigger the human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on S-spike proteins that help the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines created with these strategies must be tested to determine their safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
New-target antiviral drugs make up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries with a reporting deadline of late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is available.Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China, and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that a double dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition Chinese guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.Research shows that early priming of prothrombin protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from using these therapies without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in severe late-stage COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antisocytokinic properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing a nationwide phase 2 randomized trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to combat cytokine storms, which are suspected to be the cause of death in some affected individuals.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized controlled trial evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and isolated antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is a mechanism of action that is expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is the fluid part of the blood of a recovered patient and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronary heart disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the virus' spread.
