Traffic activity is the study of the interaction of drivers and the interaction between two towed vehicles and their towed vehicles.
As a matter of fact, it is difficult to measure traffic patterns, and it is difficult to estimate the behavior of a hundred percent of drivers.

To better replace driving, the combination of three main characteristics has been established: (1) attention, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful in planning, designing, and executing cross-country work.
