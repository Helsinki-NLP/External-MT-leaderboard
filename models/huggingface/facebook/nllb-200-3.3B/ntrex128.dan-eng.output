Welsh politicians afraid to 'play the fool'
There was consternation among some members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could be a source of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales, in Welsh twp means fool, and pwp means shit.
A Plaid Cymru member said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a brief verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fools).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to introduce the name changes, said: 'The final decision on the designations which Members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to the Members themselves.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, which received broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option was the most supported in a public consultation.
The House of Commons is expected to table a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform bill contains other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of MPs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final say on what they're called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians hold a vote on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim to Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the vote and says he will vote against it.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is merely a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are going silent, while the churches of Harlem are fighting.
"The elderly people I have spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there are none of the parts".
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People socialize in different ways these days", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounge where people go on a daily basis".
In the case of churches, he worries that the money raised from selling assets will not last long and that "sooner or later they will be back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of the kind of people who don't help the neighborhood's recurring temples.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white", he says, "and that further fuels the trend where these churches eventually close down because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condos will become members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had served nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who spearheaded a boycott of stores on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, which would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they commissioned the bell.
Father David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's, proudly called the chimes "the poor man's bells".
The expert who played the June bell called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's couldn't find a replacement for him.
What has been going on at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and entrepreneurs, some of them recruited by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The Parish Council  the parish's governing body, made up of leading lay people  wrote to the diocese in July about concerns that the diocese "would try to push the costs further" to the Parish Council, even though the Parish Council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some of the parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on a diving trip for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the first day of lobster season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just excitement about catching a lobster, but then he realized the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"His whole collarbone was ripped open", said Hammel, who saw it when he got to the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It's unknown what kind of shark attacked.
Life-saver Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lines of beauty products featuring special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to tap the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while fashion and home products decline, the larger lines of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores around the country and will be launched in more stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty products is happening as supermarkets are looking for new items for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's says they're doubling their beauty lineup to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges are also given more space with branded areas in the style of those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching a range of boutique make-up, so that the majority of products are suitable for vegans - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards buying small amounts of food daily from local grocers mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the president of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes on the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods other than food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago.
The supermarket's previous attempts to update the beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended in a dispute over how to distribute the revenues from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their 281-store pharmacy chain to Celesio, who owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 three years ago.
The strategy calls for Lloyds to play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury grooming brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty product lines to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the immersive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones "out of the blue" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home products and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The This Morning host, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she's leaving the show.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious after she withdrew from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the popular TV woman told a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals  worth up to £1.5million  meant she no longer had enough time for their home goods and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she'd left Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of his holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term project that she would be dealing with for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
Nobody would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale".
Experts estimate that the exit of the This Morning host, who is among Britain's highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products  everything from pillows to candles to clothing and home products  and the potential for further delays in the launch.
And it could also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and landlord Dan Baldwin has had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to be brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business practices".
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that was "not worthy of a president" and for being so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news anchor.
"I gave up nothing".
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting more after Trump touted their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not seeing an "adequate response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament efforts.
He noted that the US would continue to impose sanctions to keep the pressure on.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in his campaign speech.
"North Korea is doing really well", he said.
"There was a move to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results - termination of missile testing, assistance in the release of hostages and the repatriation of remains of US military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a state, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastate island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population was left homeless, a national emergency was not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit of a challenge", said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be allowed to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the earthquakes that constantly strike Indonesia, the country is very ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A tsunami warning was issued in Palu, but it appears that a tsunami warning is missing, and this has likely affected the death toll.
Even under the best of conditions, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's deficient infrastructure a focal point of his campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Yokota's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in the run-up to next year's election.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge is drawing in the final minute against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, just 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, as his team trailed 1-0.
He was tapping the ball with his left foot before he made a high shot at the farthest post.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and landed in the net.
"It was just about getting into that position, getting the ball, players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea forward delivered a heel kick back to Mateo Kovacic before setting his pace on the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's halfway house.
Kovacic made a quick one-two at the halfway line.
He then made a long pass that put Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and finished towards the far post with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will take on Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are playing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Friday, creating waves up to 20 feet high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered by debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked anyone in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Deputy Constable Brian O'Hagan stated: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also encourage anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that could be crucial to the investigation".
A spokesman for the police has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to break into his apartment, but is told by the police that no one is allowed in the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be several hours before they can re-enter.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman arrives crying.
She keeps saying, "that's so awful".
At 2 p.m., there were two police cars inside the barricade and another car just outside.
A number of officers were inside the perimeter, monitoring the apartment complex.
Anyone with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and report log 247 on September 30th.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial to be hit by the debate on " rewriting history "
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical, puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The Storming of the Bastille during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the attitudes of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure many still believe is worthy of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worthy of homage and remembrance".
A grizzly bear attacks and kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a torn wrist and smeared with blood near a pig's foot in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs injections of vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigsty next to it was open.
He said there was a giant vulture in the pigsty with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", said the cousin, surnamed "Wu", quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police gather evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is one of the rarest of all, but there have been recorded cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 900-pound pig thrust a Welsh farmer into his tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just a bunch of sick people.
They're craving, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy rain to much of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall and flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 125 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. on Sunday and was located 400 miles (620 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure outlet is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching low-pressure outlet, creating heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States for the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm surges, flooding and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical humidity will create rainfall of up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storm surges with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will create strong local winds and create dust explosions.
The approaching low pressure outlet will bring heavy rain along the coastline in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which may result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and slippery roads.
This would be the region's first rain of their rainy season.
Scattered tropical storms will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area Tuesday and continue into Wednesday.
October can be a time of great temperature swings throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but it remains fairly warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a good example of dramatic temperature variations across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build itself up and expand again.
Large portions of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to portions of the northeastern areas.
It could be up to 75 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
Over 20 million people watched Thursday's poignant testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political battle continued with stations interrupting regular programming to report on Friday's late development, a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100% sure that Kavanaugh, in a drunken stupor, groped her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional deposition that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it's likely 20.4 million people watched it on Friday.
The company reported average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available ratings from other stations that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch shows in offices.
To put that in perspective, that's the equivalent of a game in the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-based hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's nomination, was top of the pack with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on the open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there looking down for several minutes while he was being scolded and CNN was broadcasting live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All the networks were live a few hours later as the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to move Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only vote for it under the belief that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, which the Democrats, who are outnumbered in the Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an impact because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of 'playing politics' with Britain's future and undermining national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with Theresa May on the front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for the UK and EU to collect each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in custody on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The medical examiner of East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The police department says a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens have assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local police for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of", said Wade.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater, which recorded 183 discharges of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumble and the shaking for several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with street vendors as thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing independence vote.
A group of masked separatists held up the street patrols, threw powder paint, and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later that day, there were also fights, with police using their batons to keep the fighting down.
For several hours, pro-independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven", and were met by unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region, a year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low and those opposed to secession boycotted the vote in a big way.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped out the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dares to hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite a narrow but important victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either exiled themselves or in detention awaiting judgment for their role in the vote and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police and said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"There are growing tensions", he said.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'customs' in the context of the directive on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.
London police arrest men after car crashes into home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30pm BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a crossbow fired at the car at some point.
Shots from Menga give Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The up-and-comers Livingston took the Rangers by surprise, giving Steven Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference as Gary Holt's team moved up alongside Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won on the road this season and will face the leading Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will be visited by Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, is building their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt still hasn't been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing a chance against cash withdrawal.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored, and their direct style of play was causing major problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal after he slipped in to hit Craig Hult's cross-headed shot in front of the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the home team problems in dead-ball situations.
And it was under these conditions that the important goal came.
Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to create the lineup for Menga, who made a touchdown and scored from the center of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defence, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unchallenged.
That pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos had to fend off a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was deflected with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot out of the frame during another of Livingston's deadlock situations.
There were regular deliveries into Livingston's field, but were repelled, and two penalty kick requests  after Halkett's tackle on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand on the ball  were denied.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena, which is the home of the BBC's Scottish Football League.
A phenomenal effort and a strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played great and exceeded expectations on their upward journey.
Their playing style and lineup have remained largely unchanged since their return to the top flight, but a great deal of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They've been really good at times under Gerrard, but they played below the level.
Their finishes lacked sharpness - only once did they get the home team naked - and it's a rude awakening for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There have been disagreements over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police for security reasons held a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but crowds of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents  many of them Kurdish  also made their mark, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to take in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest, seen as a hero by some German Turks and derided as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after being hit by car
A cyclist has been killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford in the southwest of the city at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were lifeguards at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes a few months after another cyclist was killed in a head-on collision with a getaway car on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been rerouted, and motorists are urged to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in rioting
Six correctional officers were injured during a riot in a maximum security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was a riot at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 9.30 BST on Sunday and the riots are still going on.
Special "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the riots, which involve eight inmates and are taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Special trained prison officers are deployed to deal with the ongoing disturbances at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending longer periods behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was being treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, Urobet girls were called to the prison to deal with serious disturbances where staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with storm surges (dry areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to strike Arizona, but it's most likely to do so early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States, creating a risk of storm surge.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm surge warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 51 to 102 millimeters of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 millimeters in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to receive 25 to 51 mm, with a potential of 102 mm locally.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, Rosa's rain may be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will do some good because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second-highest category", reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still a hurricane Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and is located 400 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting cooler waters in the Pacific and is therefore waning in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical force on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains in parts of Mexico could be heavy and create a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 millimeters of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with the potential for up to 254 millimeters", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary expected hazard from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States", reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to cause life-threatening floods and precipitation in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4am BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police have asked anyone with cell phone footage of the events to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the Democratic Party's "evil and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the reckless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been subjected to "the malice, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nominating process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, the quality and the courage" in Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant record in public service", he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president was making indirect references to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republicans showing up at the polls in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks, we will make one of the most important decisions of our lives.
You cannot vote for me, but you are voting for me", he said.
"That's why I travel around, fighting for great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "step up and block".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a senior Republican Party figure has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them washed away by giant waves that washed ashore as a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu Friday when waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high hit the coast at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach, they didn't run immediately and became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster response agency BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 500 miles per hour before hitting the coast.
Some managed to survive by climbing up trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Some 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The emergency services have released aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The rumors continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The quake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Board of Assessment and Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographic location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have magnified the tsunami, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found stuck under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 200-mile (300 km) coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications "were completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 live here", said a Red Cross statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could be much worse", they said.
The government was criticized on many fronts on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived within the time frame of the warning.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun sending relief planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but food and basic necessities are still in high demand among the evacuees.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have safely arrived in Palu city, where staff are seeking shelter under tarpaulins erected in the courtyard of their account, passing areas of extensive destruction on the way, Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
It's really bad.
Even as relief organizations began the hard work of resuming relief work, complaints were received that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad may only enter if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster,' we can open for international assistance, but there's no status yet".
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family held on to the missing people in the hope that their loved ones would become the miracles that lighten the gloomy tales of natural disasters.
Last Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were attending the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one gray fly instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered", he says.
Thieves take $26,750 from a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied the cash machine at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Sergeant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "ran up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a hand-me-down that was supposed to have been delivered.
Witnesses then saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, writing, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He's replacing singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current stage name, but West has previously stated that the name has religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'", West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye  which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has alternated between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reportedly prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also switched between lower and upper case letters and changed whether the hyphens are included.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never, ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements were breaking out in many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in AI, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have made statements about artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to be the world leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged past technology competitions sponsored by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge hosted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would be held so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, says Lee.
"It's not China that's snapping up the academic leaders, it's the big corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years hired star students from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the US boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered work permits.
China's State Council released their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a manner similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations' distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
American legislation, however, attempting to create a national security commission on artificial intelligence, has been stalled for several months.
Macedonians hold a vote on changing the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership in the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a claim to Greek territory and has therefore used its veto when Macedonia has sought admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will be the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to open up associations like the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means more secure lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote and enforce it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no irregularities reported at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I voted today because of my children, we belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 on a change of name of the country that would open up the path to NATO and EU membership.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
'We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get membership with our heads held high, not through the back door,' said Mr Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote in favour because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a "yes" vote would be a "safeguard of our future".
An opinion poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would attend the poll - fewer than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provisional Government since it took office last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero battles through the Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took on the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring coming in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass at midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defenders before he swerved into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He fought his way past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's court.
He then made a left turn and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch of the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to overwhelm Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal in that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an immediate lead in the Premier League game.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero, in that sequence, took the ball deep into Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice pass down the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling to the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City will take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will tease the Rockies
The Nationals are eliminated from playoff contention, so they had little to fight for.
But Scherzer, always competitive, is hoping to take the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still a chance for the Rockies to make the playoffs, who have played one more game than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
At least the Rockies held on to a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title to their credit.
"Even if we don't have anything to play for, we can go into the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest in the crowd here in Denver, and that the opponents would be playing at the highest level that I'm going to face this year.
Why should I not be excited about playing under those conditions?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting lineup for Sunday, but will likely put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the mound for the 34th time, practiced his throws Tuesday and would pitch Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-hander from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president was referring indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court election, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republicans showing up at the polls in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is on the line this November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big things that you can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me, which is why I travel around and fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means available.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have a mission of "stepping up and blocking".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and vicious and disgusting and lying".
He mentioned the top Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, which triggered a loud boo from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
You leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, wait a minute. That was really bad body language. That was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a party of space.
They are intolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome simply because we have spoken our mind.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because of her strong opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship was to criticize me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'we want meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of my eight years as a local MP, Friday night meetings have been like this.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a "more friendly, gentler" policy is long gone, if it ever came to pass.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed against whether the party leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a political point of view began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed to - whether it was on national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak my mind in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a long string of harsh messages on social media calling for dissent and opposition to the centrist politics and telling me that I shouldn't be a Labour member.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and the fighting spirit of those colleagues who are bombarded every day with sexism or racism, but who nevertheless continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how commonplace abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a culture of tolerance.
But in reality it is no longer a spatial organisation and with every vote of no confidence or change in the selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that if I just shut down and don't get all high and mighty, I'll "get by".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, when I was in school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect of our classroom, and I set out to create better public services for those who needed them most, whether it was as a councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion on Friday, I would say that as the country rolls towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not see the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of disqualification or political aptitude will deter me from acting in what I believe is your best interest.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr tops the list
Two late scores may have given the final result a not entirely truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved victory in this fantastically entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the standings and the only undefeated team in the Big Ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defense as their better use of chance that brought home the home team, and Coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"Our battles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "With respect to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scotland international Rory Hughes, who was dealt to the match by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a goal which was not followed up by a kick.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty just before half time, he scored and then got a solo to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's goal, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point gap to five.
There was a long interruption as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was carried off the pitch on stretchers.
Acting Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose exploited their extra man with a Bruce Colvine goal without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson could score behind the advancing Ayr cluster after a line-out.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the posts and followed up with another almost immediately after play resumed, after Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick box and sent wingman Gregor Henry off to the home court's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the restaurant business
Still-game star Ford Kieran looks set to make the leap to the restaurant business after it emerged he's taken the CEO position of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in with his collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source indicated to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant market".
"The sea is ours": Inland State of Bolivia hopes court will reopen Pacific route
Seamen patrol around the navy headquarters, encased in shields, in La Paz.
The flag of the blue sea is raised on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It is our duty to take it back".
Throughout the landlocked country of Bolivia, the memory of a stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still vivid, as is the longing to sail the Pacific again.
Hopes are perhaps at their highest in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and is naturally looking forward to the outcome with a positive outlook", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will give Bolivia the approval that Chile - after decades of negotiations - is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's sentencing.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But analysts believe that the court is unlikely to take Bolivia's side  and that if it did, there would be no major changes.
The UN Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, has no power to hand over Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice pronounced its verdict only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have backfired.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership", Zárate said.
The war-like rhetoric of Morales has destroyed the last remnants of Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end a 139-year era of disagreements and win-win", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its access to the Pacific", he added.
"The conviction is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past".
North Korea says it won't disarm unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never dismantle its nuclear weapons if it cannot first rely on Washington.
The European Union has also been involved in the negotiations on the new agreement.
He called on the United States to honour promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments followed reports that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a reset of stalled nuclear diplomacy over three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wishful dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to make a declaration until Pyongyang has first taken significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump will have another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about eliminating an arsenal that it most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collections of large headgear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to increase your hat collection or block out the sun, you'll find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne took to the catwalk to unveil a collection of oddly sized headgear as part of their SS19 collection, which made an impression at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the runway.
The most impressive work by Valentino was a lavish one with a broad featherlike shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were other extra-large accessories, too, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple, but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips joined together, more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a scuba diving equipment with a snorkel and a mask, and another looked like a melted waffle.
And if you continue to make the big counter-statements, you're in luck.
Stylists predict that the giant hats could be heading for stores near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a two-foot-wide shadow seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that was spread across social media has sent a new big creation down the runway - a straw beach bag that's almost as big as the model that's displaying it.
The orange bag with the brimmed brim and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching item in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in mainstream stores next summer. The designer has had such an impact that it's hard to ignore the demand for giant-sized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a long history of academic excellence, and in 2018 they continue to deliver outstanding results in examinations, supported by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With up to 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector able to tailor and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits him in the head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it reaches his heart".
It's an important reminder that we can't just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest examination results this year that languages are at the top of the statistics with the most successful exams in the independent schools.
In all, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received an A.
Data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now seen as a subject choice at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' classrooms and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities in the future will require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career the young people choose, if they have learned a second language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start on their competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 people in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
Knowing more languages, especially those of developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, the languages taught vary between schools.
Some schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be the most important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a range of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
At the present time, there is no denying that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland's young people.
It's time to do it.
John Edward is the chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will most likely not play the entire game.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need to play games before the season to get ready", he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is opening a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies next week, including rallies in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm Trump's nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat on hold, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held at midnight (U.S. time) on the night between Saturday, November 29 and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely be speaking at this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, which were strained by allegations of sexual misconduct, and the anticipated Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary purpose of this rally is to provide momentum for the Republicans who face a tough election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week are meant to "build energy among volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and build on the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
The evening rally will be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to draw Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to drop out to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, who teaches political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown a fighting spirit and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles duels
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man matchup might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but one that the players believe in - especially at competitions like this one.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we're probably looking at it as a little bit of momentum", said Jordan Spieth, before holding the puck.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, they're four points ahead, and there's 12 more points to play for.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high cheers became louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important putt that secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His putt that secured them the match on the 15th hole was met with a similar shout  the kind of shout that shows that he doesn't think the American team is out of the competition yet.
"You just have to find the strength within and focus on your own fight", Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the biggest story in Ryder Cup history.
Europe's odd but sympathetic pairs have taken four points in four games and appear to be flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild crowd shows that they are the ones who will be the hardest to beat on Sundays and it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is sealed by Fleetwood or Molinari as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
All the healers synchronizing on every one of their holes.
It is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefed Sergio Garcia this morning in the four-man duels when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeyes on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball, two-player matches are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change like a flash.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has built up a significant lead before the final day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the US, have questioned.
Europe up 10-6 ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a big lead heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The well-played duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far taken four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, looking to win the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an imprecise American team in the morning's fourball and won the series 3-1.
The United States put up more of a fight in foursomes, winning four games, but still trailing.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles games if they're going to keep the Cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight, and he and Molinari, collectively nicknamed "Molliwood", are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four in their first four games after a sensational weekend.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a dispirited Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought his way through the first two games on Saturday, had some brilliant flashes, but now he's lost 19 of his 29 fights in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning's fourballs and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and had a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  who is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has everything it wants on a lightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas led the way for the Americans with two points Saturday.
They had a hard fought 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team fought its way back from being down by four points before the singles, but with the Furyks currently in possession of the trophy, they only need to draw to retain it.
After being second best for two days, it looks like they won't be able to master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they won't unilaterally disarm if there's no trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are strengthening their distrust of the United States and that the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" within the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, closing a nuclear test site and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and unilaterally disarm".
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, whereby North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his speech seemed important because it did not explicitly reject unilateral disarmament, as has been the case from Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work on "nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to the easing of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'nuclear first' and adds sanctions to pressure to achieve its goals by force and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'", Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are increasing our mistrust".
Ri did not mention plans for another summit between Kim and Trump, as the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament was negotiated with South Korea and not the US, the negotiations would not be so deadlocked".
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile launching against the US mainland was inevitable, after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened the "total annihilation" of North Korea at the UN, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council must uphold sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve total, final, verified nuclear disarmament".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to halt Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, while North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands" just hours later.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to shut down a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the US took "responsive action".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps" he was demanding were the security promises Trump made in Singapore, as well as moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep, designed to counter the growing macho culture of studying all night high on caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world's finest universities often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea for the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the paper was finished, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I only learning this now when I'm at graduate school?'
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can improve academic and athletic performance as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health department, says that the university decided to offer the course after finding that students were severely sleep-deprived during the week.
The hour-long course includes various interactive exercises.
One of the exercises shows a picture of a classroom where students are asked to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part of the course, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive map of the campus.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we feel that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect your health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of taking an all-nighter still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said. It even counteracts weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think you're starving, which is why you're constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his courses during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a public course at the university.
He hopes that the next step will be for all graduates to be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up, which can help to raise awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and make it more difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: goal from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the road, as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's disjointed team had to take the fall with a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first home win since their 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as manager, giving Hearts eight points to the Ladbrokes Premiership's number one spot.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Ranger team could not respond to.
Rangers now down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third place behind Hibernian with only the goal difference.
And there could be more bad news coming to the Rangers, as linebacker Calum Spence was treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that appeared to have come from the road section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the squad that reached the Betfed Cup semi-final by outscoring Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, was facing the same 11 that had shaved a point off the Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhaust the opposition all over the field.
The Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first-stroke sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt missed.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the back post.
The Rangers took control, but they were more about hope than skill on offense.
Alfredo Morales was certainly not pleased when Judge Steven Thomson overruled the Colombian's appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless tied after a quarter of a game.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head kick and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livi's opening in the 34th minute was a bit of a fluke, it has to be said that it was deserved for their efforts alone.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't handle a dead-ball situation in the deep from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could kick it into the goal easily.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave the game to the wingman as he sent the ball in to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the outfield to play on their own premises with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final period of the game, but McGregor dismissed Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed in from the side of the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty after being dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson looked the other way here as well.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today  if we COUNT...  was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a staple of both science and popular culture, as seen in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as peasant scientists:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms, like the radioactivity in the minerals".
Evans: "Oh, my God, this is it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before what would have been his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune systems to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine is showing promise in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is to take immune cells from patients and change them in the lab so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "provides the pathway for a number of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and intestinal cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, whereby immune cells are taken from patients and "taught" to attack cancer cells, has been found to be effective in treating a specific type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
That didn't go well.
After a rocky Saturday Night Live performance, Kanye West was booed when he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he began a thunderous speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I cared about racism, I would have moved from the United States long ago", he said.
SNL kicked off the evening with a Matt Damon sketch in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault charges.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's tirade on social media.
It's uncertain if Rock was trying to expose West by putting up the footage.
West also complained to the audience about the poor treatment backstage due to his headwear.
"They were bullying me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said I was sunk deep", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see how low I've sunk?" and said he wanted to put on his Superman cap because it means, "You can't tell me what to do.
Try with love".
Audiences bowed at least twice to his comments, and SNL staff seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with a comment from an on-stage person: "There was silence in the studio".
West had been booked as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose then-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song "I Love It" while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NEVER LATING YOURSELF OUT OF THE PLOG".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "the way he is, and it's totally fine".
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his 'art') who embraces and embraces an ideology that is harmful to society.
He has a license.
And so have we", she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had changed his name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to have changed his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rap colleague Snoop Dogg goes by the name Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The accused is expected to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is reaching out for toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for wielding the sword as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor reaches out to the stereotypical macho hero and says that these types of TV characters often mean that young men feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he believes "something has gone wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that the problem is "very much on his mind".
"At the moment, I am very concerned about this. Where did we go wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what have we taught young men growing up?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the highly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born, and what is taught?
What is it that young men are learning from television and the streets that makes them feel they have to be men in this way?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong with the young men".
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be making sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "done with battlegrounds and horses".
Kit will be joining the cast of Sam Shepard's True West reboot, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best part of the whole Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so in that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 persons in the country are affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to near zero, say Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of the country's conservative values.
Many infections are due to the lack of contraception in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denied Saturday allegations that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were from websites and supporters of the "far right".
"Lies, lies and more terrible lies", Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The leaked information allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites like Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, and then they published information about a member of Waters' staff, writes The Hill.
"This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a blatant lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is a complete and utter lie".
Waters's statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It is a bitter denial", Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
If you're accused of something you didn't do, don't get angry.
You must not become defiant.
You can't question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your head".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is aiming to take Waters' seat in the midterm election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if it is true", he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations".
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone on my staff".
Johnny English hits the spot again. A subversive spy comedy starring Rowan Atkinson.
It's become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British slant, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and re-emerged in 2011 with Johnny English - Born Again.
Will daring, sarcastic self-satire, no matter how hard it is for us, become the country's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and big eyes has been given his permission to make roars again and again, and his name, more than anything, signals that he is a comic invention aimed at places where the cinema-goers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the plump secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife-edge Mr. Bean and a proper slap from the man who performed a single note to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international lustre pants who left chaos in his wake, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot at the trunk from JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers rang against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comedy, but his sense of humor feels quite understated and strangely superfluous, especially now that more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer compelling comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-film antics in the role of Mr. Bean.
The timeless premise of the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field to the horror of the agent in charge - a very unfortunate role for Kevin Eldon.
It's a last chance for a pompous, battle-hardened prime minister who's already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there's not much to work with in the script.
When her security advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she's forced to cancel someone's pension.
And of course, that's the crappy Johnny English, who's now the superintendent of a high-class school, but who's secretly teaching how to be a secret agent.
English is rushed back to an emergency meeting at Whitehall and reunited with his hard-pressed former right-hand man Bough, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overzealous but well-meaning submarine captain - a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the royal intelligence service is all but unable to find Batman and Robin back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is stumbling close to being infiltrated by the charismatic and creepy tech billionaire Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough embark on their frenzied risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the final sequence of the film, but however well-intentioned and energetic, there is a sense of child-scenes to it.
It's pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't help thinking with the other Johnny English films, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does his talent justice?
Labour refuses to scrap four-day working week plan with unchanged pay for Britons
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the British can settle for a four-day work week but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants business leaders to use their AI savings to give employees an extra day off.
That would mean that the employees would have a three-day weekend without a reduction in pay.
Sources say the idea would be consistent with the party's economic goals of pulling the country in a more favorable direction for workers.
The Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day work week as a way for workers to profit from a changing economy.
A senior member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year".
"It's not going to happen in a day, but a four-day work week is an objective that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy for the benefit of workers and the party's overall strategy for industry".
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the motion is not unanimously supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and is not under consideration in the party".
Labour's shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used last week's party meeting to lay out his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he's determined to wrest power back from "anonymous directors" and "exploiters" in utility companies.
The Shadow Finance Minister's plans also raise doubts about whether the current shareholders of water companies will get their money back, as a Labour-led government could "counter-balance" them on the grounds of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to have workers on company boards and to set up inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 per cent of the share value of private companies to employees, who stand to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their vote
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI's findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to the idea than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
"When I went into the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the allegations came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was steely, decisive and unambiguous".
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be set in stone.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and anything else would require a very violent indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett denied it in the strongest possible terms", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see how that would change anything".
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City hosts the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive lineup of artists and an equally impressive goal: to end world poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to Central Park's vast lawns, where they can look forward to concerts by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, while raising awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, writing to a world leader, making a phone call, or doing something meaningful to raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to reach their goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really make a difference, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - that is, people feeling that they are making a difference by signing a petition online or making a Twitter ad?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "acts" by its members directed at various targets.
They believe that these actions have spurred world leaders to make binding commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 targets and actions that had been created as a result of their actions, which amounted to over $10 billion that had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main targets is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor-business partnership that aims to "help children reach their full potential" and pledged $35 million to help alleviate nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online appeals.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions, which is, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
wrote Global Citizen: "It will be a long and hard battle, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement, it will succeed because we are stronger together".
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US may use its navy to "block" Russian energy exports, says US Secretary of State
"If necessary", Washington can use its navy to block Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's meddling in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to expand their energy sales.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe", he is said to have said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The US has the ability with our navy to ensure free passage on the sea lanes, and if necessary we can also block them to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation which considers itself the "voice of American energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are basically the same.
'The economic opportunities with Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuels,' he said, referring to Russia as a 'one-trick pony' whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration spokesmen, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the choice of supplier", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The Americans' position is met with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the BDI, has asked the United States to intervene outside of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
'I have a big problem with third party interference in our energy supply,' said the head of the BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "strongly considering" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is "strongly considering" running for president after the midterm elections, she said Saturday.
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and it requires a woman on the front lines", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for the presidency".
Warren expressed his opinion of President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "Of course, the FBI will be investigating this before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday shows that the majority of Warren's own constituents do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against a possible lineup.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will announce his final decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after coming home makes me relate to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are coming home with", she told an audience at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and said of her son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become tougher, wondering if there is any respect for what their colleagues on the ground and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, said Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. delivered a nonpartisan statement in support of an asylum seeker who is opposed to the law in Washington on Friday, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace vs. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law, has not been released.
She claims that her partner "and his violent gang-member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of American asylum seekers come from, as countries with widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a 2014 decision by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new law "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an impediment runs counter to that principle", the NDP statement reads.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law of rejecting immigrants harms the American economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide necessary labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions took away the right of immigration judges to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his promulgation of the law on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems - or just all the serious problems - that people all over the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, the search for survivors in Palu becomes desperate.
For survivors, the situation became worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water".
The residents returned to their devastated homes to sort through their soaked belongings and salvage what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5-magnitude quake, could not keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors for severe aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he related how the powerful earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pinned up against a broken wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then the silence died.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of using unethical methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper carried a four-page ad in an American daily that trumpeted the benefits of U.S.-Chinese cooperation, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily paid-for entry into the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 congressional elections.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, with each imposing tariffs on each other's imports in several rounds.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the trade war would hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an editorial in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is "stepping up its use of the unfair methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the proud American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by running a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, however, you will find only a few dissenting voices, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's differing attitudes toward China's worrisome economic direction, as the media is under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, though he did not say which one.
Republicans are alienating women ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has stirred up emotions, and most Republicans have already made it public that they'd like to see the voting process continue.
"This is not a do-over", Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts Republican Senator Jeff Flake's request for an FBI investigation in the 11th hour will appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday  they don't forget it tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters at a Senate rally shouted "November is coming!" as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to reach new heights", independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
"People say it has already reached a high level; that is true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among women swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters  18-29 years old  who rarely vote, despite not liking the president".
Even before Ford's public allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had pointed out that there could be a setback if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It's become a bigger mess for the Republicans", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it's also about how the Republicans have handled this, and how they've treated her", points out Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in getting elected to the news network.
But the American people seem to have divided opinions on who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, the latter of whom has a bit more on his side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh either probably or definitely lied during his deposition, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At Flake's urging, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, in his drunken stupor, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both students at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend is called Inrupt, a company built on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solids technology, so people can create their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a single browser at the same time.
The unique feature of online personal data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to bring together resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some software developers on project contract and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether they should change the whole thing so that all of their business models are suddenly redundant".
"We do not ask for their permission".
In a Medium post Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet being built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a key voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is being launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Clergyman receiving the Victoria Cross from the First World War
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross for fighting in the First World War is being commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's monumental feat.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery".
He later ran to the front line and led his men forward with "greatest courage" before single-handedly attacking an artillery gun and disabling three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but which makes me humble".
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underlines the true heroism".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch the star-studded Bellator 206 and then being denied the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown all night long in England on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet, viewers in England were taken by surprise when the transmission switched to Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed, having stayed up all morning watching this particular match.
One Twitter fan described the switch to a children's cartoon as "kind of a sick joke".
"Legally, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president, when asked about the program.
"The pig Gurli, yes, he is".
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said that they would work to include British viewers in future planning.
"Thinking about the re-broadcast, I think we can make it work", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning over there, and we don't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the switch happened, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually the legislation.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're just going to play five games instead of the usual six, and we're trying to give our fans something extra, and then we're going over time.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley had "less than" sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that growing up, he felt less worthy than anyone else because of his sexuality, but that it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he did not realize until he got to the upper grades that "not everyone is like me".
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was speaking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the long-running radio show, Kirsty Young, has taken a leave of absence due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worthy" than everyone else in his upbringing because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, the feelings of being worthy and of being different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they learned of his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT advocate, and used her participation at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been an issue.
He said it's hard to find someone his age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age  he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about winning a gold medal", he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012  when he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it was only when he stopped breathing and was dead that it became clear to me that he was not immortal", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics.
It was also the inspiration for his first song choice  Proud by Heather Small  which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to make up his form if he doesn't want it to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is setting a record for the 12th time he has competed in the competition, which is held every two years, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the center of the action in the United States, as usual, the five-time major winner had to cheer and practice his game in hopes of straightening out the whiplash.
Even at the height of his career, he had the most even drive, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes stray shots.
And if the court wasn't big enough to fill your mouth, Mickelson will face the all-time British Open winner Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who will start the 12 singles matches, start strong, Mickelson's match could be decisive.
Furyk expressed unsurprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a great faith in himself".
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's given so much to these teams before and this week.
I didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I imagined he would play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everybody else".
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite been able to measure up to his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence adds something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to stick people, and he's good to have in the team room", he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He's contributing a lot more than just the game".
Europe's captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup singles match can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Danishman made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just about to be caught before the finish line with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won just exactly", Bjørn says after seeing the 2018 team win both Friday 5-3 and yesterday to a 10-6 overall lead at Le Golf National.
History tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
I want it to be full of garbage by tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side - the best golfers in the world".
Pleased with his players' performance on a difficult course, Bjørn added: "I take none of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performances that count, and that is something else entirely.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on every parameter like a golfer.
That's what the players need to understand - get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he must also bring out the best in himself".
The opposite is true for Jim Furyk, who is hoping for better individual performance than in the match play, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk has had his own experience of the last day, first at the winning team in Brookline, then when he lost, when Europe did the "Miracle on Medina".
"I remember every word", he said when asked how, in 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We're putting our teams in line, putting the players on the court in the order we feel like, and we're trying to create magic tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the relegation and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through", Bjørn said of his choice of singles players.
Germany's new battleship is delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War, but the Germans have to wait at least a year more due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media reported.
The commissioning of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, the "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, which the Navy ordered back in 2007, are to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest frigates is a reduced need for maintenance: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships - which are supposed to make Germany look like an overseas power - will already be obsolete by the time they are deployed, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a series of crucial "software and hardware errors" that made the warship unusable in combat situations.
The software error was of particular importance, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships are to be manned by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the manning of the older Bremen frigates.
It also proved to be far too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's ability to carry out future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failure, the cost of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's Defense Committee, admitted that the navy is "running out of ships ready for deployment".
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were being decommissioned without being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were ready to become part of the fleet.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of the bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to uncover how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will help in future conservation efforts.
The study is being carried out by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected sites in the area to record the bat activities during the season.
Data is also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bats and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to establish the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of grasslands and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and Britain has declined dramatically over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban development projects that affect the seabirds and restrict their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks by pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they hunt primarily at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use advanced echolocation technology to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often gather data, inspect the nets and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The area manager, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a very good area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is a lot that is unknown about bats, so the work here and elsewhere can help us understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before doing any maintenance work on property, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, risking the extinction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it's illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called for the public to lend a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how populations evolve".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges as lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape allegations against him "fake news" and says people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, which brought the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, criticizing the information as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to be able to do this.
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's not unusual.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good", added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unforgivable publicity of the privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says that the player wanted to seek compensation for "moral depravity in a class equal to the charge, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the report filed in the municipal court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" grabbed by "the one percent".
The court papers allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed at a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now says she wants to reverse the deal, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident allegedly took place, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will always regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain would "regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily reduce production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that longer waiting times at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"The way I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March", said Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are expressing fears of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is related to supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal exit.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which according to the car industry could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's production at the Derbyshire plant and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "simplified to avoid exactly these checks at the border".
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us - as I call it - to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The comments from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been a successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the joint trustee at the factory, says his members are becoming increasingly worried: "My experience tells me that once these jobs go away, they won't come back".
A government spokesman said: 'We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the showdown over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking over his shoulder at special counsel Robert Mueller as he investigates Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the acting attorney general and thereby risk Mueller's independence has been a topic of gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president via Section 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and rumor had it that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was arranged for Thursday with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: 'There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed back a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press up to date".
Some journalists wanted to challenge that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not because of TV reporters playing for the gallery, but added: "I don't mind them playing for the camera".
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president is taking more questions from the press than any president before him", she said, adding, without quoting a source, "We've looked at the numbers".
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States direct questions, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to give it a chance, and you have seen us do that over the last couple of weeks, and it's going to take the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States".
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, as he made an improvised and at times mysterious figure in front of the reporters present.
Health ministers meet EU staff in Scottish health after Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK is due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for the residence permit applications of EU citizens working in its devolved public sector.
In his letter, Mr Freeman said: 'During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued and it seems that decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts made by each of our staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from within and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie is having emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was rushed to emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessees' Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident occurred before halftime.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell over there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are "no details as to the type or extent of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when he incurred the injury.
Abercrombie is a sophomore and in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, which gives him 18 total tackles this season.
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money is supposed to help the homeless, according to the Conservative Party.
This move is to dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will hit those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it will raise £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in Britain, to the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after those with the highest incomes.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to support the government's fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The extra charge, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-unit purchases and purchases for rental purposes, could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects it to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by people living abroad, which causes prices to rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying up land they don't use, and urged May to drop quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain's "shameful housing situation".
Corbyn has proposed a remarkable series of housing reforms, including controlling rental prices and removing the landlord's ability to put people out on the streets if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life is better for every generation.
And that means fixing our dysfunctional housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be that foreign businesses and people living outside the UK are as easy to buy homes as hardworking Brits.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the indignity of sleeping on the street is still too prevalent".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be Scotland's coach"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to one day become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club, who are now third in League One, three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always pulled me in.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I had success coaching clubs".
Ross's predecessors as coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he had no qualms about following such established names at such a big club and had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success by 'can I get this club back in the Premier League.'
"The structure and facilities of this club are such that it is undoubtedly a Premier League club", he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his coaching career after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to recover from relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from relegation threat to the title the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalls of his time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought that coaching was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
That's weird, because I was doing well, making a lot of money, and I had some success stories.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still that kind of stress and pressure that comes with training, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to exercise, and now I do, and I've never been more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life".

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., study shows
The heat wave this summer has boosted the income of England's pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Pub and bar sales rose 2.7% in July, while restaurant sales fell 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant who compiled the figures, said: 'Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup has meant that July follows the pattern of June, with pubs recording sales of 2.8%, except that restaurants are hit harder now.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurants in June was only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on the sale of drinks fared the best, experiencing growth matching the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want a drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% for the month, while food sales decreased by 3.3%.
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: 'The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the out-of-home market, the weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It's no surprise that the restaurants are still struggling, even though a 4.8% drop in sales year-on-year will really hurt on top of rising costs.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide much-needed breathing space".
The overall increase in sales for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the decline in newly launched brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales figures for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 different groups, whose annual turnover is more than £9 billion and who are leaders in the field.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children  as young as 11  have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a study.
A survey of 20,000 schoolchildren in grades four through nine reveals a rise in fake Insta pages.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted
20% of students said they have a "master account" that they can show their parents
One in five children as young as 11 years old create social media accounts that they hide from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in the fourth grade and upward reveals a sharp increase in "fake Insta" accounts  a reference to the photo-sharing service Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show to their parents, while they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager who was encouraging others to "rape me".
The survey, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It's scary that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "athlete's voice" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of directors of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and chairman Ian Bettie described the move as a good opportunity for sporting decision-makers to benefit from her vast 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit from having her on the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help to set a direction for sport in Scotland".
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and who now frequently commentates for the BBC, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell whether I would recover and to what extent.
It's been a lot of work, but I'm completely recovered, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows get mixed reviews online
One breast-feeding company shared its views online with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is billed as "the world's first silent breast pump", the tech consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music-video-inspired advertisement that aims to show the freedom the new pump brings to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay to a song that says, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see the tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this isn't the yucca, it's my breasts".
The phrase is, "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding my child, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my breast".
But the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it mocks the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them soon after birth", wrote one user.

Another wrote: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement".
Others defended the ad, while one woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny".
"I think it's a very good idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd have had one.
Breast-feeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product", wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a funny commercial for mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in restrooms) and feel like 'cows.'
It is not an advertisement praising or criticizing the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have been dancing with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the ad is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses, and fits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of breast-pumping, while in an entertaining and recognizable way, showcasing the freedom that the new pump can provide".
It's not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother walked two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camps on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children being detained has exploded, even though the number of border crossers has not changed, in part because of the Trump administration's harsher rhetoric and stricter laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by coming forward and accepting a child.
The risk of repatriation increased in June when authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult household members would be required to provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that they had arrested several individuals who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had clean criminal records.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt down these individuals", Albence said.
In an effort to expedite the processing of children's cases, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, compared with 60 days previously, aid workers say.
Many use video calls instead of going to an immigration judge to plead their case for legal residence.
Those found to be unlawfully present are deported swiftly.
The longer children are held in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, according to aid workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates of better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced in larger facilities like Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep track of whether a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria notifies US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighteenth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the presence of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means".
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
The European Union is also calling for the establishment of a European Union-wide network of civil society organisations, including the European Parliament, to be set up in the Member States.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have cleared all Syrian areas" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council adopt a directive on the protection of the health of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens and the risks related to exposure to carcinogens.
'We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these repatriations,' he said.
"They are policing what should be a purely humanitarian matter".
The US and the EU have warned that no aid will be made available to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia against the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Mr Moualem stressed that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists from the Nusra Front, an offshoot of Al-Qaeda, who 'will be wiped out'.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the legislation in the current constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another term.
By that logic, Trump will likely be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment trial and scandals end his presidency early, which many liberal viewers may hope for.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!"
At this time, there is no sign of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled for MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has the highest viewership with up to 3.5 million on big news evenings.
"It's a spectacle that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, who hosts the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a head of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a tax trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other TV programs, the stories coming out of Washington could decide the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited, and the health of the world economy.
Changing channels is only for the most privileged.
And yet, it's about more than being an enlightened citizen when you watch the six-hour panel discussion, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket ("dressed in hybris", The Washington Post wrote) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' vivid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily surprises (fights with the N.F.L., praise for Kim Jong-un).
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got Fleiss this week, it was a hundred degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't force himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh up for a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court to be decided.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows back in the day, and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right".

Big money making its way to the close midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is receiving a huge amount of money, as a result of a tie-up between two Congressional Districts, two congressmen are vying for the same seat.
This newly redrawn suburban district in Pittsburgh is causing problems for Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been unlawfully set up in the Republican Party's favor.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a battle for funding between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-profile election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed its mind.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with little protest from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and was running a hotel in Panama until partners kicked Trump's management team out.
State Department officials decided to recall top U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished, and they got about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for, you know, drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development, which was supposed to follow last year's meeting, which was seen as a step toward preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thus dropping the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal of the importance Americans attach to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the case, as described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who wanted to discuss the internal deliberations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Know the Story
The next obstacle could well be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller is also reportedly going to focus his investigation on whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the election attack.
If Congress were to fall into new hands, Trump would likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet again with voters and eventually, of course, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I am not saying that Trump's demise is inevitable  nor his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the inexorable march of democracy is made to rise or fall.
In the United States, we are now facing several of these turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump fires the man who will determine the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been vacant since this newspaper reported that he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president last year and challenged his fitness to hold office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times's production is inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is discontinued or not properly conducted, or if he is approved by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do this.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the very Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy's homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the candle on the table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic with that in my luggage?"
Norman Eisen is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien.
Rangers take on SK Rapid Wien on Thursday, and after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a win against Austria will give them a good chance of advancing from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game thinking we could get something back, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the sting home, but all in all, I think it was a fair result.
They may have been the best team in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European night.
We're hoping to get three points, but it's going to be tough because they had a good result in the last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can put some pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been tough because of all the things that have happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying themselves.
Hopefully we can go on now, put last season behind us and make a success".
Anxiety about retirement makes women sleepless
Although the participants in the study had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationswide survey said they discussed the cost of longterm care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to initiate the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationswides Life Insurance.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not tell them in time what you want.
Use your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you would like to receive care.
Ask your financial adviser: Your financial adviser can also help you figure out how to pay for expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by means of traditional long-term care insurance, cash-only life insurance or self-insurance with your own funds, as long as you have the money for it.
Get the legal papers in order: Take the legal battles in hand.
Have a power of attorney prepared so that you can have a trusted person manage your medical care and ensure that doctors and nursing staff respect your wishes in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic power of attorney.
In this case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and see to it that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in need of urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy - who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medication?
Who's watching the dog?
Get the plan in place".
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home from a city walk.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the groin and the hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m., as "completely accidental".
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications out of the way, emergency workers have been unable to receive information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the quake.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The town was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a rain forest that stretches over 200 miles [300 km] of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Center.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is located on the seismic ring of the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake along the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including over half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that swept the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 30 feet (10 m) that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing havoc and panic as the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on $500 bail without bail, reports KTUU.
He was arraigned Saturday, pleading "clearly not guilty", the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a sentence of one day in county jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of misdemeanors.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of a report of a domestic violent crime, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups after explaining her son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity or communication roads, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of Central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment the earthquake struck.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami swept up on the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get a terrorist suspect in NYC sentenced to the rare death penalty
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that was last carried out for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were beaten.
The prosecution's case for the death penalty is that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, as required by the Southern District of New York's death penalty declaration of intent.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible outcome of both of these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in connection with gang activity, typically used by public prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and preparation", the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "monstrous, vicious and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily harm and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", is what the letter of intent says.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last brought defendants to a death penalty trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up serving a life sentence in September 2009.
The last death sentence to be carried out was in a New York state case in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov was from Uzbekistan and showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he felt good about his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung on his hospital room, the officers said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty and not to accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense had earlier asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
The Conservative minister believes that Nigel Farage should take over the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative rally today.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to be able to 'notice the pressure' from the Eurosceptics  after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
The common Conservative MP Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that Britain would have "been out by now" if Farage had been the Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge to bring the deeply divided party together is underscored by the Conservative Remain taking part in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her compromise plan on track amid attacks from both Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels  and thereby force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or 'chaos'.
At the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now", he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must scrap Chequers.'
As to the background to his opposition to the Union, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone denied that public attitudes had changed since the 2016 referendum: "That the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong".
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally and told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who are actually on the street getting us elected.
Stop with the Chequers and start listening to me.
She added, as a point of criticism to May: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told the march that politicians should be able to "notice the pressure" if they fail to follow the decision from the 2016 vote.
"Now it is a question of trust between us  the people  and our political class", he said.
"They want to betray Brexit, but we're here to tell them that we're not going to let them get away with it".
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: 'You have to make sure that the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feels the pressure.
"We are mobilising the people's army here in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain".
Meanwhile, the Remains marched through Birmingham before a two-hour march into the city centre.
Scattered activists waved Conservative Anti-Brexit banners after the group's breakaway this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security problems with the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
"These are the people who claim to have control of the IT systems and technology for Canada, for border controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he said.
"This is ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren "considering strongly" running for president
House of Representatives member Senator Elizabeth Warren "is strongly considering running for president" after the November midterm elections.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has been a frequent critic of Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against state Republican incumbent Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's been speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman on the front lines".
Arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU's Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested Friday at an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man in the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of his injuries", said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present, to having a weapon and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is now in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims was a six-foot-three junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, and last season, he played in 32 games, starting in ten, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Lewis Hamilton is close to winning the world championship after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the lead, Bottas got off to a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton down completely, as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to pit, leaving Hamilton to fight back against the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes pitched a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton was back in front when the Ferrari driver, after some wheel contact, reluctantly had to leave the inside track after a double defense on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race, when in an attempt at a quick finish he failed to change the tyre to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to pit on the 44th lap, but couldn't pick up the pace on the last eight laps, so Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible job to secure both first and second place", said Hamilton.
Really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign rally on Saturday for insisting that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a West Virginia rally, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that events in the Senate showed that people were "vile and disgusting and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and vicious and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
"When you look at the statements and the leaks, and then they say, 'Oh, that wasn't me.
It wasn't me".
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked this?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document?
No, no, no. I know.
I have not leaked anything".
Hey, wait a minute.
Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything", he added in a parody of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September  but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I have not covered up Dr. Ford's allegations, and I have not leaked her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I have done so".
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's rally, "I'll tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
In the president's continued defense of the Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexually assaulting three women, Trump suggested that Democrats use the allegations to further their own cause.
"They spare no means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the viciousness, the ugliness, they don't care who they have to trick to gain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against the Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did well again after losing Friday's Elite League match against Belfast Giants by winning the return leg 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly took the lead with two goals, with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier coming on.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's match in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting between the two sides this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer made a fourth-minute field goal at 3:35 from an assist by Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assist, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 1:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind the Cownies' equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer put the Giants ahead at the first break, as he made his second goal late in the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard equalised again with a fine goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure that hundreds of airline passengers avoided earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks are still ravaging the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21 year old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for their lives, he refused to leave his seat in the swaying control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in his seat to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was parked on the tarmac, was safely airlifted.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News of Australia.
We obtained a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are devastated", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the country's disaster management agency is announcing that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins and it is not possible to reach them", said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters high have destroyed Palu, which is holding a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute another ambulance comes with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops have been looted".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're getting.
It's a tragedy, but it could be much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was struck by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia is now saying that one man is missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that it was unable to locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not responded to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline says six passengers were hospitalized Saturday night and all are in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very shallow water.
"That was really lucky", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could walk into the water to the life to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working to renovate a nearby pier also assisted in the rescue effort by using a rubber boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts are establishing a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded its evidentiary hearing Saturday in the indictment of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telemetry to piece together the history of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed he, along with his friend Michael Sanford, visited Sanford police.
Sanford sat in the witness box on Saturday and told the court that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records show they'd known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip-hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believe that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to the basics and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently been revived in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for firing a man with a "racist" text.
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a text message by mistake from the mother complaining that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied being racist, but compared the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is a mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ, not yet a black person", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she ended up sending it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she realized her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, saying that their former African-American nanny had been bad at her job and was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the firing and for $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to have lived with the family, even though this was agreed upon without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't afford to do something like that", she told the newspaper on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have defended themselves by saying they are not racists and that Maurice's firing was justified because they were afraid they wouldn't be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she would not have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children with someone you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your baby?
I mean, honestly".
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone that way?
It's not very nice", the investment adviser added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the People's Court has already written off the couple on social media, shaming their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted for publication, said of the letter: "It is hard to imagine being the one to read it for the first time before it was published.
It's quite a fun read now that you know how popular Paddington became".
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little rag doll, would have been optimistic even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man and did not like to boast", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who accomplished something: you're proud of them, even though it's not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity in that way.
"Even though it was his doing and his imagination, "he used to say it was all Paddington's fault".
Said goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called from time to time to say that it was really bad and that she probably wouldn't survive", Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that she was going to die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling.
I'll see you soon.
See you.
The medication she had been taking to keep her heart beating slowly lost its effect.
She was dead a few minutes ago, and now she's shutting down the body.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get my shit together".
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knew", she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning Women Try to Stop Suicide Shoppers
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I go through every day", she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"His smile was known to all.
People said his smile lit up the room".
But he stopped working before he died because he was feeling really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about it spreading".
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself. You have to talk to someone".
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sad or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make any eye contact with them".
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get over it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart. I'm not sure what to do.
But we all have to keep going and fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future remains uncertain as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a time-limited study with a limited scope - we might get a little bit of agreement", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee had "fallen from its post" amid the deadlocked partisan situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican backers not want the FBI to do their investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if the Republicans, as expected, do poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains to be seen whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'falling' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's Ministry of Comparative Affairs, said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers contributed to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comment.
By far the majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border running into North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forcibly repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still technically at war - have improved markedly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This comes after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on a global scale.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the US, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way we will disarm on our own", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, "hysterical" and said his temper was not suited for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved in that way, she would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke about his family and his high school years, he almost cried and was about to cry.
He also condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and a coordinated character assassination" orchestrated by the left, who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved he couldn't sit on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi is dodging when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to trial if he's confirmed and if the Democrats win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit on the Supreme Court, but certainly not the court he's sitting on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently sits on the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on Obama's health care reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"We cannot have some hysterical, prejudiced person challenging a job as a judge and expecting us to say, 'Oh, this is not cool,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger that's been building up, and she can't get it out of her system without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal, do you think it is?"
She continued: "I was greatly encouraged by a woman who was a manager, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm mad at you".
And then she just kept on going.
And I thought, "That was genius".
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overwhelming majority of men, where I often cried in anger, where I was grabbed by the neck by an older woman  a cold boss, whom I had always been a bit afraid of  and dragged out on the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be glad they caught you".
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she might as well run for president herself.
"It was not a very well thought out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the running, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech about not running, she was overwhelmed by emotions  gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to raise money and reach voters instead of electors, and anger over sexism  that she got a lump in her throat.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", recalls Schroeder, referring to the press reaction to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, "What will they write on my tombstone?"
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salvoes of the U.S.-China trade war were loud, and while the battle is far from over, the rift between the two countries could be a long-term boon to Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods is in principle on half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to give in just yet.
If that gets Washington to back down on its demands, that means they're giving in, but for China's president, Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, US pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create a breeding ground for an economy that could get out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than people thought", said Abigail Grace, a research associate with the Asia-focused think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to take in refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to allow the refugees to return and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism,' he said.
The Government continues to control the areas devastated by terrorists and is working to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now in place for the refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011, when the war began.
An additional six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the ravaged country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that were helping to support the insurgency.
Europe clinches the Ryder Cup title in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the American team 16.5 - 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, having struggled for most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on the par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari performed well in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record since 1979, when the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent off with 5&4 by the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
The world number one, Dustin Johnson, dropped two and one to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his bag, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get that trophy back.
It is a team effort and I am happy to be able to help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram, who knocked out American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I followed him as a kid", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
That's a ridiculous statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had trouble finding form all weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had solid play throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said: "I'm proud of the guys, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a counter-attack.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, and I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we'll move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten up.
We were defeated".
Update on algae blooms: Concentrations decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decreasing algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, there are reports of widespread blooms in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier , suggesting that concentrations are decreasing.
The bloom of algae spreads across a coastline of 210 km from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are smaller blooms about ten miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but there are fewer blooms than last week.
Flowering has also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations in or to the sea have been reported in Pinellas County during the past week, low to high concentrations in the sea outside of Hillsborough County, background concentration to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentration to high concentrations in or to the sea outside of Sarasota County, background concentration to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentration to high concentrations in or to the sea outside of Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory distress is continuing to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory problems in northwest Florida in the past week.
