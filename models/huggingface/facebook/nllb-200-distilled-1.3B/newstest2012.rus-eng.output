Parliament does not support the amendment that gives Tymoshenko his freedom
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in the course of amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to repeal the article that convicted opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
An amendment that would have led to the release of the jailed former prime minister was rejected during the second reading of a bill to reduce sentences for economic offenses.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia that was deemed unprofitable.
The verdict is not final; the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.
Tymoshenko argues that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; the West also suspected bias in the process.
The motion to repeal Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, under which the former prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify.
The victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or insurrection, Libya has had its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in the desert somewhere.
It's time to determine the winners.
Islamists usually win; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional government has declared itself a follower of the conventional Sharia law, which we have heard about before.
Libya will be a crime-free country, as the punishment for stealing is to cut off your hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
Libya will be an order we cannot imagine, and we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither unique nor better, and probably would not be appropriate, for example, for the population of Libya.
In fact, it's surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only excuse was that they believed the NATO strikes were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if you look for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We've been in the crossfire, we've served Islam, and our politicians have gotten rid of the dictator, their political ally, with no guarantee of profit.
In light of our recent sad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population thus had no need to worry about the Crusaders being driven out.
Although without the occupation, will the oil companies get Libya's black gold for almost nothing?
And then the West will finally be able to boast of its selfless defense of civil rights.
Unless the Sharia will stop it.
A new wave of crisis is beginning
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors' attention.
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have released their third quarter GDP figures.
The Czech economy was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France are showing growth.
And yet the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France's - by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted for the second quarter, in which Germany performed better than expected (up 0.3% from the original 0.1%).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, GDP was stagnant compared to the previous quarter, confirming a gradual slowdown in economic growth, according to the Czech Statistical Office.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economies of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth of 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analysts' forecasts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of both Italian and Spanish bonds are approaching critical levels.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc. are starting to have difficulties.
Despite the deteriorating situation in the region, the yield on Czech 1-year bonds remains at around 4%.
In Germany, they say the ECB is the last creditor who can save the situation.
The Czech national team has qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and celebrate a surprise cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully completed the most difficult challenge of the season!
Thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Jirácek, they won 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky enough to retain a significant advantage after the home replay, and it will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and made a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and good luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Jirček; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates their entry into the European Championship.
The Czech team's excellent defense allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovich and Vucinich are the most unlucky pair in the match after missing two great opportunities.
The great Peter Chek is one of the reasons why the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute, the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty with combinations; the game was mostly played in the middle of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the home team in the first half, as the Czech defenders were able to carefully intercept the long shots behind the line of defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have created a live shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
They are thereby expressing their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, students prayed before entering the building, followed by a prayer for the destruction of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a human shield around the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant.
In doing so, they demonstrated their willingness to defend their country's nuclear program at the cost of their lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that there was evidence that Iran had not given up its nuclear weapons program.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
Tuesday afternoon, students prayed before entering the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant, followed by a prayer for the destruction of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralyzing Iran's nuclear program, the targets, according to the Israeli press, would be the plants in both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Nutrition for children with obesity: No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to a recent study, children who are obese tend to come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
We see once again the importance of the environment and the behavioral patterns that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausages are on the tables of children who are obese almost twice as often as those in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19 percent of obese children ate French fries for dinner the day before a survey for an educational event called Obesity is no accident.
Moreover, families with children who are obese do not exercise, but this is true of most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children said that their parents make time to exercise at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year and involved nearly 900 primary school pupils from all over Bohemia.
The event Obesity is not an accident was held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4th to 8th grade have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate exercise are the major determinants of the rapidly increasing number of children who are either overweight or obese.
"For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five meals a day, breakfast-breakfast-lunch-breakfast-dinner, which is a prerequisite for proper nutrition", says one study.
No lunch and no sausage in the evenings.
Experts warn that even such relative details as a regular family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast separately.
The worst finding was that one in ten families didn't have breakfast at all.
Yet, breakfast is the foundation of a proper daily diet.
The study found that fried food is more common in families with children who are obese.
Almost everyone , regardless of weight , drinks a sweet beverage every day (70%).
Although more than 40 percent of children regularly participate in sports, this figure drops more than half - to 15 percent - when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, the children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to create their own menu based on the food they were offered and their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating".
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
"The high popularity of sugary soft drinks is of particular concern", the study concludes.
As the main meal, pasta beat the slightly heavier bird.
However, the children showed little interest in legumes, fish, and vegetables.
A healthy lifestyle
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits if they are given appropriate information.
"Many of the study's controls showed a significant shift in their preferences toward healthy food when they completed the questionnaire after the lecture.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sugary soft drinks, where more children preferred water.
In addition, the children often noted poultry and fish as the main dishes, limiting the amount of sweet foods and pastries.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals.
In my first article on stylist training, I was puzzled by the amount of information in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what was coming next.
Three lectures from experts in the field; tips on how to dress for a different figure; and a seminar on how it all works in real life.
More to come.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical assignments await us.
Training is every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really rich with information.
This time, with the principal, Alenka, (there are no men in the class) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, another has a boyish figure without proper forms, another weighs more than normal.
A stylist must know how to visually reduce the shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add the missing volume.
We were given advice on how to enhance the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, who have bigger breasts and thighs and a narrower waist, without wearing too provocative.
For example, if the waist and hips are so different that you cannot choose a skirt or pants, you should have at least one item made to order.
You will certainly not regret the investment, for a perfectly fitting garment is priceless.
A custom-made skirt will make you feel much better than one that's always squeezing, rolling, exposing your waist, etc.
Women with boy figures, on the other hand, may wear clothes with ruffles, applications, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of this information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to figure it all out.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we've been given.
Each participant had to design two outfits for a celebrity: one for the day and one for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style of dress, and their figure.
I'm going to dress Miranda Kerr, who you may know from Victoria's Secret campaigns.
I'm happy for myself because it's so much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained a ton (please bear in mind that I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them online, print them and process them with graphics software.
The mudboard, the result of the work, reflects our own style and attitude towards the graphic.
It's important to keep in mind the graphic component of the style.
The stylist doesn't just dress real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on specific instructions, such as fashionable bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But it was only on Sunday.
A stylist needs general knowledge .
The Saturday lecture, which was rich in information on the types of figures, was brought to life by three guests - experts in the field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench. He is also a fashion designer.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist must use that fact.
A good stylist knows how to use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn normally over jeans and a T-shirt, like a coat; but it can also be worn on the naked body, without clasps, like a dress.
Or you can roll up your sleeves or lift up your collar and the whole picture changes.
"Play with it", he insisted.
Anyway, the advice I appreciated most was, "You have to know the rules of your job perfectly".
Then you can start breaking them,' Jacob told us.
And here I finally understood why we're so obsessed with definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, when in fashion magazines we often see something completely different.
Not to mention the fashion show.
I learned from Ben, the photographer, that a stylist should have more options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a ten-page fashion review (equivalent to ten outfits), I have to be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in a picture, an item of clothing often looks and functions differently from the way it does in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a great vocal range, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
Attitudes toward stylists in the Czech Republic are still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider it superfluous (and believe that being an expert in something is enough, and how they look is secondary).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to give us a different size than the one they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and see if there's been any tabloid stories about some celebrity gaining weight or losing weight, etc.
On Sunday, both Honza and Mario emphasized that it is not enough for a stylist to know fashion and be able to pick out an outfit.
Our work is mostly about interacting with the people we dress; so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to be condescending and to hold your own.
"If the manager asks you to go through her clothes and add a few nice things, you can't throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her her clothes suck".
"Find at least a few things you can commend and suggest what you can wear with them", says Mario.
He also showed us what specifically a work bag should fit.
It's a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious items such as scissors, sticky rolls, or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylesmen use it when shooting some items, such as a bag or hat), special clips to fasten fabric on the back in case the clothes are too large (sticks and similar items are prohibited, as they wear clothes) or a sewing kit.
To distract from the lecture and gain some practical experience, we learned how to make the correct shoe pads.
Even when shooting in a studio with a smooth floor, the soles can get damaged - not to mention shooting outside.
So we're in the process of putting the tape on.
You shouldn't touch the shoes with scissors, or you'll ruin them.
It takes real skill.
I was pleased that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills you mentioned.
That's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend class.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't easy, no matter what people say.
V Need for Speed: Escape is set in America.
The review
What should have been a carefree walk has become a routine morning commute to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were met to some extent, but that didn't matter, because no one was obviously willing to do extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Flight" were attached great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; the demo versions indicated that the game would take its rightful place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the protagonist gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, the end result is a lot different than we expected.
The game is a fairly good arcade racer, but the overall impression is spoiled by a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in reality, these are not errors, but the manifestation of inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts off very well.
You become part of a story where the protagonist, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race across America.
You get in a car on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
There are some interesting things about this idea.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race runs on its own route, with individual stages taking place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the game is always the same.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in previous installments of the series, some tracks are enjoyable to watch.
Yet, the game does not evoke strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, the autumn suburbs, or high in the snow-capped mountains is a pleasure.
And the race occasionally brings an unusual detail to life.
For example, in the desert, you're caught in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to fall under an avalanche.
The individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you try to outrun several competitors (essentially a regular race); then you try to improve the time (standard race with a stopwatch); or you compete with one opponent.
You also run into the police from time to time, which makes your job even more difficult.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not that hard.
Although surprisingly, these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be exact).
It actually turns out that this is good for the game because it's not boring, and that's one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of the previous models.
It means that she's no longer special, but that can't be considered a flaw.
If you're looking for a simulation of real life, you'll have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although better options can be found on the market.
So far so good.
But after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect a game like this to be complex and to have a lot of transformation and collisions, but if you have no idea how your car will behave before you hit an object, something is wrong.
Usually, when you're passing or overtaking cars in a traffic jam, you'll occasionally touch another car slightly, and yet sometimes in a similar situation, your car will start to spin wildly.
Or it was shattered.
It's not that important because of the reboot system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are designed so that if you crash or stray far off the track, the game will take you back to where it left off.
However, only five reboots are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful in case something goes wrong, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes restarting isn't enough, and you have to memorize a specific part of the race.
A major drawback of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to be done a certain way, otherwise you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you'll find civilian cars in a certain location in the same configuration whether you're first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute late.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily pass between two cars moving in opposite directions, whereas when you get there, the cars are already in position so you either have to go around them or slow down.
It doesn't matter when you're around them; everything is set up so that the situation always happens right under your nose.
The competition has other advantages.
During the game, you discover several locations where, regardless of time, the same opponent is overtaking you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge, where you're driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand up to you no matter what.
The thing is, when it's driving in front of you, it's going to affect your view, which leads to one or more accidents in that area.
You can understand trying to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-filled, but it's so obvious that it quickly becomes irritating.
It's a shame, because despite the simple driving pattern, the game is fun and sometimes so full of action that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what you're not bored of, a concept with 50 unique tracks, a racing sequence or something else.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to keep track of the gas stations along the way, because they are where your car can be replaced, even though in most cases the one you already have is quite sufficient.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are great for cities; high-powered American cars are great for straight stretches of highway; and exotic super sports cars are great for technical driving, like on curved mountain tracks.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it is racing through individual areas that you learn about as the game progresses.
Here you earn both medals and points for your personal cause, common to challenges and story modes.
There are many options available to get a higher level of driving: from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides a connection with the public.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; this is an example from the last race in the sequence.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (let's say so) where you race along the tracks in the dark (let's say so).
Your speedometer shows a figure of 150 to 200 kilometers per hour (let's say that's it) when suddenly a subway train hits you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For days, our editorial staff debated whether it was really that nobody thought for a second while the game was being made, or whether the creators really thought we were such fools.
The game's technical aspects are not particularly good, but the overall experience is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it's unfortunate that at some critical moments the quality of the recording, sometimes quite dramatically, declines.
This is especially true in large-scale events, where a good recording would not be very helpful either.
Sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
To appeal to a wider audience of young people, the soundtrack 'includes compositions from different styles'; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is rather messy.
If the game avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Either way, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Sure, it's good fun, but be prepared for the shortcomings to blind you like an airport beacon.

The ambassador to the EU , Visenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for being unfriendly and skeptical of the euro.
"The Treaty of Lisbon caused considerable disagreement between the various organizations".
"I didn't expect it to be such a brutal war".
"It will take five or six years before the situation is stabilized, calmed down and all the players get used to their new roles", EU Ambassador Milena Vitsenova began her lecture at the law school with a sharp start.
She proved how committed she is to her motto "Clear and Open about Europe" in the very first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and their relations in a way that many lecturers at the KU Law School would envy.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, critics said he was just a gray office mouse who couldn't play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role".
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 participating countries at the same time, communicates well with them and has a clear idea of the direction in which the EU should develop".
She explained her new position as the EU's representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question: 'Who is the European Union?
No one is going to ban our cheese.
Vitsenova further focused on a programme that is key to the EU's past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency a successful one the year before.
The Czechs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they overcame that crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the ensuing financial crisis have caused the current ferment.
It is also necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be tight and economical, which areas will be given priority, which countries will receive more support and which less; all these issues are in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "About Europe, in a clear language".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, and jargon that nobody understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties.'
It also intends to make more efficient use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organisations.
A high-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador claims that Czechs are considered Euro-skeptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Alongside the successful Czech presidency, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland or Hungary and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad group again?' and he's not happy about it.'
In the future, the Vitsenov Union expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
Compared with the new European Federation, she considers the idea of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe more realistic.
"We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation".
"For the first time, it was said that countries that wanted to unite should, while those that did not, could stay out".
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe", expects Vicenova.
In this respect, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member countries, not just those in the eurozone.
The history of the brand:
IBM is entering its second century of innovation.
If anyone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest one is probably "long-term".
IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution for the general public; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was built on the foundation of its first boss, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could be easily solved if people would just think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the title of his internal journal, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means moving forward.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, even though it wasn't afraid to change everything around it.
In our first 100 years, it allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the next hundred years, we hope to do even more", says Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current CEO, on the occasion of the anniversary.
A complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached employee care in the same way that Batea had in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a complex bonus system for top inventors and entrepreneurs.
Equally advanced are IBM's long-term relationships with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company found brilliant uses for talented people, and it was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it great choice.
Consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy and current plan, a woman, Virginia Rometti, will succeed Palmisano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the director of sales, marketing and development.
For the past few years, IBM has been hosting meetings, online brainstorming sessions, that have spawned many future innovations.
It's no surprise that there are so many ideas -- the company has about half a million employees.
A reputable organization
The company's strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company in terms of concept", said Harvard Business School professor and IBM author Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems with technology", adds George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company says, there's a difference between going to market and creating a market.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the "Blue Giant", as it's called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company -- developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services -- from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees have won Nobel Prizes.
Her inventions include, for example, the ATM, the bank card, the financial swap, the barcode and the floppy disk.
With $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (first place is held by Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all of its products were to the taste of the customers and fit into the era.
"If your business is defined by moving forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past", says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundation on multiple platforms -- if they don't work, it throws them out.
This is what makes it different from, say, its competitor Microsoft, which is based on and survives the crashes on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM's primary revenue comes from services, about one-fifth of which in each case comes from computer software and hardware.
Whereas in 1990, with half the capital, it was the strongest equipment manufacturing company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yield assets, while investing $58 billion in new technology.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was first hit by the current economic crisis.
IBM follows the example of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have been unharmed by the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM's stock price has risen by a record 120 percent; the company's net income has been steadily rising.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but your own values.
So it's to be expected that even if another crisis does break out, this resilient giant will be able to handle the situation.
The history of IBM: from the cheese knife to space flight.
IBM was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name was "Computing, Tabling, Writing Corporation".
It took the name IBM in 1924, originally a brand name used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1880s.
They had technology like the legendary "table clock", a clock that kept track of when employees came and went from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also headed the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired a director of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The CEO then pushed the founder of IBM into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis of an unshakable corporate culture and personality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, started out manufacturing and selling a variety of business equipment, from cheese knives and meat cleavers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenues doubled to $9 million, and the company began a massive expansion into all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place as chairman.
Under his leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both employees and IBM computers helped NASA monitor spaceflight -- to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 -- the manned flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer manufacturing to the Chinese company Lenovo, while simultaneously buying the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully concentrating on consulting and high value-added services.
Over the last three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is to use technology wisely in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve road conditions and city governance.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps business owners control the entire trading cycle.
IBM's traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM established its own branch in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe are in Prague, where a world-class speech recognition research group is also based.
Richtarzova about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Richtarz (53) became Iveta Bartoshova's bodyguard and lover (45), Darina still hoped he would wake up and return home.
However, she doesn't want to wait any longer, and has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner", Richtarzova explained.
When Darina Richtarzova gave a roof over Bartosova's house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And even though she forced Yvette to leave Rhizhan after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
In fact, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she finally said goodbye to him.
Richter doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richter and Bartochov ever parted, his wife would not welcome him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will kick him out".
"But he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom I have something to do", said Richtarzhowa, adding that she had already broken up with her husband and insisted on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has no problem with his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm going to be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that".
"My wife has decided to keep the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision".
"Our union is still functioning; I am in charge of the renovation, the garden, the house and the shopping".
"Darina and I are fine, except we don't share a bed anymore", Richterge told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzova finds a new love, he will not interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she's with, or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I take full responsibility", Joseph concluded.
Women's Worst Habits - Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad habits of women, they usually list them all right away.
Ladies, would you identify yourself in the following lines describing some of the female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Does your significant other complain about you going shopping all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to shop at big sales?
If so, your shopping may be a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their shopping addiction.
Yet, who among you would not walk into a clothing store looking for a perfectly fitting garment and try it on (preferably in different colors) in the showroom?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men, it can be hell.
Just think of the number of times you told your significant other to wait outside...
The eternal complaint
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - why don't I start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
- You did?
Then you're in the group of women who are obsessed with their looks.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men are literally allergic to their partners' constant complaints about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequent such complaints are, the more women are annoyed by them.
It 's all about order and cleanliness .
It's like an endless story.
Wash windows, vacuum, floor, dust, bathroom - at least twice a week.
Do you criticize your partner for stepping on clean tile in dirty shoes, children for dirt in a clean sink, and fingerprints on a living room window that was so hard to clean?
If you suffer from this "deviance", try to realize that going to extremes is not good; and that order and cleanliness should not be the priority in your family.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship and even your entire family.
The Will to Command
"Throw the laundry in the basket".
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels should not be on the floor".
If you make remarks to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course you mean well, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to be in charge so much...
The gossip .
Some women enjoy gossiping, insulting, and scheming against others.
Women are relationship-focused, so they like to talk about who, where, with whom, how and why.
From time to time, I suppose we all gossip.
Let's face it, that seems to be the nature of all women.
However, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the female workforce, are a greater danger to their environment.
The results of the passes by Jagr and Voracek helped Philadelphia win .
During Monday's NHL game, two productive passes from hockey forward Jaromir Jagr helped Philadelphia win 5-3 on the ice against Carolina, again becoming the most productive Czech player of the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroud used the experience of the thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another pass and was named the best player of the match.
The two resulting passes also belonged to Yagor's teammate, Yakubu Voracek.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he predicted Giroud would have a great evening.
"I told him before the game he'd score a hat-trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes you feel things like that", explained Jagr, whose actions led to Giru scoring on the first opportunity the Flyers gave him.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech trail".
Hurricanes' closing guard Woracek took the puck and passed it to Max Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap to a numerical advantage, but the Flyers led again early in the second half.
Especially not Gira.
After Jagr's successful pass, he scored his third goal; his shot was later converted into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three", Jagr said, praising his center.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a hockey player like him".
"It makes me happy".
"I want to support him".
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now it's my turn", Jagr added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Root and Dwyer's penalty, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Matt Reed prevented further complications, increasing the gap to two points.
"The Pronger was doing great in our zone".
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reed went over to the end zone".
"I aimed at him and I'm glad it worked", Voráček described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The win moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the game against Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an upper body injury.
With an experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point lead and lost 2:3 after a penalty shootout.
Tomasz Plekanec failed to score during one of their attacks.
More than the lost points, the home coach was saddened by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad".
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people".
"In any case, we can't do anything about it, we just have to accept it", said Jacques Martin.
"Substitute after substitute, it was amazing and we couldn't resist".
"We needed to make the game easier, move the puck out of our zone".
"What was our weakness", added defender P.K. Subban.
After 30 hits, Czech goalkeeper Andrzej Pawelec helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5-2.
The Jets' goals that ended a five-game losing streak were scored by five different players.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state tourist agencies could operate in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was strictly limited, travel agencies of the time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists went on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which led to significant restrictions on Czech tourists' travel to Yugoslavia.
A big paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel alone, for example to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was required; otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered tours to the West, but you had to either stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" at the agency.
And that's not all.
A currency permit was required for travel to the West, and was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit it was impossible to obtain money (western currency) for travel to the West.
Most often, Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the emergence of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit is still present today.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While before 1989 a vacation to the GDR or Bulgaria was the highlight of our travels, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that before 1989, we could not freely visit Croatia, which is the most popular country today, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the visa requirement for Western Europe's neighbouring countries was abolished, leading to a huge wave of short trips, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get enough of traveling to the West.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in tents in parks because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism in that period was the desire to bring their own food (cans, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of the freely convertible Czech krona, which after decades our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our living standards and average incomes were rising, which led to another important development around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines, and now, in comparison to the past, air travel has become incredibly cheap due to the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the late 1990s, Czechs didn't need visas to visit almost all the developed countries in the world except the United States, which made our travel even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000 when the great demand led to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been taking Czech tourists to warm exotic countries.
Today, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries each year!
And another important event of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, happened in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the visa requirement for Czech tourists, joining the ranks of the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad in 2008 (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15 thousand crowns per person during their holiday abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The general assembly must elect a president, the threat of the duck returns
Czech football has not had a president for about five months, and there is a risk that Ivan Gashek's successor, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general assembly, which will be held in Nimbursk on Tuesday.
There is still no consensus on what election rules to follow.
Without that, the vote for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jindřich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik are all eager to lead the Czech football.
Gashek resigned from his post in June, and in leaving, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
However, the Gaschek era has once again plunged football into a feud between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became clear on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates to the general assembly came to the National House in Prague in vain, Smikhov, as negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote at the general meeting - only legal representatives or officials who had been given authority.
This point has since been partially settled thanks to the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on the powers granted is impossible.
Disputes over election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help much, although in its regular and special meetings it is mainly concerned with this very issue.
Though the ideas behind voting have changed several times, the key question remains the same.
The question is, how do we get to round three and avoid the duck?
"The dispute is whether to follow the established norms or find another model", says FAČR vice president Dushan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's management.
Based on the model set out in the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who has received the most support from the chamber he is running for.
Moravia is said to agree to a compromise - to consider the candidate with the most votes in both chambers the winner of the election.
The Czech side insists on the condition that in the overall percentage ratio the winner must get at least two thirds of the vote.
"However, the two previous rounds would then have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of two chambers", Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments, saying it would be better not to change the rules and to vote according to existing norms.
Tomáš Paclik agrees with his opinion, although he believes that the election rules set out in the charter are more satisfactory to Pelt than to other candidates.
"I'd like the election to go as legally as possible".
"I want to avoid all kinds of representative stupidity like the last general assembly", says Victoria's owner Plzen, who is a first-time candidate; and in his remarks he largely contradicted Pelté.
Pelta is still optimistic.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nimburgo; he also hopes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the emotional ferment will calm down after today's highly anticipated national team qualification for the European Championship".
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate", says the representative of Yablonec.
Reichl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but the situation is very ambiguous".
"This is not between Bohemians and Moravians, but there is an attempt to deliberately adapt the rules".
"This could cause another disruption to the general assembly".
"I hope common sense wins", said Reichl.
There's not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight that was to take Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, among others, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction.
After all, the ministerial meeting, expected on Wednesday, could be crucial.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobesch, would like the opposing sides in the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
A lot is at stake: government subsidies; football's creditworthiness; and ČSTV's planned general assembly with the new Czech sports directorate after Saska's financial problems.
Patzlik enters the presidential race because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of the football players Plzeň Tomáš Paclik had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would meet all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even have applied for a high post.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself".
"But no such person has been found yet", Patslik told ČTK.
Patlik's motive for entering the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindržih Reichl was to try to prevent Pelta, the presumed favourite of the election, from entering the FAČR management.
Moreover, Patzlik stresses that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when the next general assembly is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see this position filled by an experienced top manager not too involved in football life.
"I've spoken to a few people who might be in mind".
"It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don't even want to be involved in Czech football".
"I wish I could change my mind", he said.
Currently, the main disagreement between Pelt and Patzlik is due to Pelt's relationship with Roman Berbroth, president of the regional football association in Plzeň, a controversial figure who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist who can influence the votes of delegates to the general assembly.
Paczlik therefore considers it unacceptable that Pelta should become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward".
"With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging to football", said Patslik.
He alludes to the fact that several years ago Peltas name was recorded during a wiretap in a corruption investigation; Peltas managed to avoid a conviction.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelt victory would bring to football".
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Patslik, who now does not mention his previous statement that he would "sell the Płyn club if Pelta becomes president".
If Patzlik wins on Thursday, he could be considering working with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Patzlik endorsed before the general assembly in September, which ended in a fiasco.
"He would be the first person I would turn to".
'He is very capable.'
"I can picture him as the head of the national team".
"But he can't run the association".
"I don't stick my nose in things I don't know about either", said Patlik, who drew a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judging team led by Lüděk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Patzlik claims he's willing to risk running the association.
He cites his experience managing private companies; he has managed the Płzien team since last summer, which with his help celebrated its first league triumph in May.
"I have the power to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better".
"To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal council, which leads to disgusting situations", said Patslik.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level for more money to be allocated to sports from lottery fees.
"It's one of the key things the new president should be doing".
"If gambling is taxed as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money goes", he said.
Paczlik does not consider his connection with the Płyn Club a burden, although he claims that the FAČR president should be independent.
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, and Reichl to Dukla of Prague.
"This is not a perfect choice".
"Yet I don't see the point of hypocritically transferring my shares in the Plzeň club to someone else when I'm going back there in six months", says Patslik.
Pelta has promised new FAČR rules that will allow him to avoid the Selection Pat.
Two days before the FA's general assembly, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected he would fight for the new FAČR rules to avoid future disputes over the election rules.
Until Thursday's Nimburgian talks, Jablonecz's official remains optimistic and believes that the focus on the campaign will be significantly distracted by today's expected success of our football team.
Before the failed election in September, Pelt promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to stand in the election at the last minute before the last general meeting, so the two-month delay could be useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday".
"They feel that now is the time for someone to lead the association", says a man mainly associated with the Jablonec Club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and on the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, the rules, which were not as perfect as we all thought, were adopted at the general meeting in June".
"If different ways of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president by September", Pelta said.
He described the rewriting of the key civil association document as a false objective for the delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal mission, and I will take personal responsibility if that attempt fails".
"It's a fundamental issue that we cannot live without", Pelta says.
He also says he doesn't try to stand out from the competition.
He has previously stated that he would like to work with Jindrych Reichl, whom he values for his legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Patzlic, who was constantly criticizing Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year and has had some success".
"However, his attacks were indecent and many people were surprised by his campaign methods".
"Even so, some of them now doubt his true identity", Pelta said of his rival, who he claims is true to the declarations he made in September.
He considers his main weapon his knowledge of football, from the lowest level competitions to the national team.
The national team should represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemians or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal".
"Immediately after that I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football", the forty-six-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as head of football would not result in staff firings.
"I'll need to know the job description of individual employees". That was his message to Insurance, where the prolonged intergovernmental period is understandably nervous.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general assembly, he believes that the delegates will come to Nimburgh on Thursday for a reason.
"If the only issue is how to get the third round, we can handle it".
"Football needs the confidence it can only gain by finally electing its leader", says Pelt, who remains optimistic two days before a key day in his career as a functionary.
Reichl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR will start to work actively.
If at the meeting on Thursday, Jindřich Reichl, the acting vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the association are rumored to be unhappy.
Reichl promises that if he gets elected, it's time to work hard.
He wants to change the system and make executive committee members responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gashek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football in general".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national teams, professional football and youth football events".
"I don't mean that I'm going to do everything myself", Reichl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to distribute the powers of the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area".
"I will carefully assign tasks so that in each of these segments football has made great strides forward".
"This is probably not going to be popular with many people because it would mean hard work, not just criticizing the work of others", he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidacy.
"Or I know I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I won't be surrounded by people who are putting sticks in my wheels and questioning my every move", he explained his doubts.
"However, many people told me not to give up or others would come".
"It's a trust I can't break", he said.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to overwrite it".
"Processes have been started that can bring results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them", he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association could return to what it was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that Mirek Pelt is hardly competent at".
"He's surrounded by people who would play football in a way that only the chosen ones can play".
"I can be blamed for many things, but certainly not for subjectivity".
"I'm trying to be objective".
"I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just a select minority", Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies the accusation that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people try to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to think about splitting the second league into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which would continue to fight in the first league".
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia", Reichl said.
While the president's fight is being entered by the manager of the Plzeň club Tomáš Paclik, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"Nevertheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes", Reichl said, adding that he has saved tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, negotiated television contracts and negotiated a lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelt was "excluded from the process of restoring creditworthiness to Czech football", he considers another rival, Patslik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzen this year".
"If elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees".
"He would not distort the facts for his own benefit", Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump in the water.
I 'm not going to lie .
Children's swimming pools with universal fiber optics and the state-of-the-art swimming pools in Budapest, where travelers can try the incredible waters of Europe - and relax their tired bodies in a Jacuzzi after a city tour or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
There's one thing Iris Meder couldn't live without during her exploratory trips over the past year and a half: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored art nouveau swimming pools.
She quickly added every pool she liked to her notebook - with important details about the building's construction and history.
Architectural historian Meder has visited more than 200 swimming pools - and now compiled her impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joys of Swimming), which covers everything from public swimming pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Taunas.
Her "journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and she visited baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true swimming culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, Medder says, but in the water it's different.
The only drawback is that swimming enthusiasts have to deal with the blue tile and chlorine smell, while runners can breathe the tempting scent of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so horrible", says Medder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools".
When the surface doubles the architecture
The splashing in the pool and the refined oils in the sauna are so important for the health of bathing because, Medder says, all the senses are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real treat for the eyes if the builders take on that kind of work.
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and trampolines.
The 190-page illustrated book The Joys of Swimming provides valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and makes you want to jump in.
The collector of ponds Meder discovered several outstanding specimens during research in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (the Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasper), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest.
From the many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, you get a great view. You can see all of Zurich from the rooftop pool or you can see the snow-covered Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Anton. And the steam room has a window that lets you see what's going on on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld, where the Aqua Cathedral in Etztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, three open shells that appear quite small against the backdrop of the Etztal Mountains, emit steam.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Medar, a pool collector, didn't find the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, and the Arpad Baths in Bekeshchab smell of oil so strongly that you may find it hard to believe that you are in a spa.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in alkaline water, which is almost black from the mud that sticks to your skin as soon as you dive in the pool, a kind of healing experience.
Iris Meder, however, at some point became disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim, and when she tried to visit the open-air pool of the Czech Baths in Lugachowice, she found that the area was sealed off.
The baths designed by architect Dushan Yurkovich in 1902 were closed.
When Medder peered into the red, white, and yellow windows of the Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in the Schwarzwald - the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction, and you'll find not only neo-Romanesque elements from the period after it was built in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra-style hall, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from the Black Forest.
"It's a real achievement to combine so many different architectural styles", says Meder.
Swimming in a thermal pool in a palace like this is clearly a secondary activity.
Speculation in agricultural products
The Deutsche Bank is investigating the agricultural trade.
I 'm not going to do it .
Will the Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has given a task force to investigate the impact of speculation on the poor worldwide.
The CEO plans to make changes in January.
- What ?
According to one survey, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of those polled want Deutsche Bank and other banks to stop trading in agricultural products, as the trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schumann, shows that gambling on world stock markets drives up prices - and banks are thus responsible for world hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed directly at Deutsche Bank head Josef Ackermann, although major banking houses such as Goodman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are trading the same.
Originally, commodity rates were intended to protect traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that the players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism, vowing to investigate the allegations and stating that no trade was "worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international task force is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank with recommendations for action.
The bank's then planning to announce changes following the investigation in late January.
Trade in goods may decrease or even cease altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch president Thilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical attitude toward the financial sector. "The stakes on soaring food prices are a stark example of how thoughtlessly banks are currently acting against the common good".
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, according to Bode.
"The Deutsche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make monetary bets on food prices", Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's quick reaction is surprising at first, but meanwhile the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before his term ends.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not be moving to the supervisory board as planned.
The abolition of the controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also has little to worry about the costs - the consequences will be borne by his successor.
One in two would not invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
The study was conducted for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa on November 7 and 8, and 1,001 people took part.
No more than 11 percent believe that investments that bet on food prices are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bank customers would also take specific steps if they found out that their bank was involved in such trading, according to the study, one in two would withdraw deposits, which ultimately lead to commodity speculation.
Forty-three percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing their account and moving to another bank.
21st century house in Vienna
Pavilion at a new location
I 'm going to get you a drink .
The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, and was empty and abandoned.
Now it's reopening as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, and bold beliefs in technical progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its lightweight steel and glass floating structure.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
He eventually became world famous in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and its sister, the bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a building for temporary exhibitions, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna South Station, converted and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th Century" for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which to hang artworks and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna found a new home.
The house has been vacant since 2001 and its condition has been getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolph Krišanić has now restored the pavilion, which has been named "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening, a joyful occasion in every sense.
Agnes Husсляin-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, promoted the new venture.
Huslyn-Arco, an art history graduate with a brilliant career as a figure skater in her youth who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and curators to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and made a decision about how the building would be used.
The new museum was to house the permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruba Foundation, a café and a bookstore along with contemporary art.
Strict control and limited budget
Krishnitz was the perfect candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession by Josef Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied under Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him "an extremely important place", where he visited exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and he knew the challenges that the building faced, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems with the last renovation were much more serious, with the building being an "energy drain", says Krishanitz.
Window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, fiberglass-reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The steel transoms of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos from the ceilings was removed.
The two lower floors created space for new use of the building, a sunken light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still an elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color to protect against corrosion.
The cinema hall is the same as it was before.
All this under strict museum control and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and would be approved by the museum board", says Krishanitz, pointing to the uneven floor in the basement.
The building has remained flexible and lightweight despite limitations, challenges and transformations.
Krishanitz recently remarked that the Brussels pavilion was rude - a typical "drop in the city" story.
Such architecture is "always out of place" and yet wants to "stimulate real awareness".
The 21st-century building is in a very good location because of an unexpected success in city planning, with a completely redesigned "main station quarter" of offices and residential properties growing around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur, as the 21st-century house may be supplemented by the second building of the Krishanitz - collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired Berlin's Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city to move it next door to the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multi-million dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has released an anti-crisis plan to avoid cancelling trains in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The cost would be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional €70 million this year to avoid winter cancellations and delays.
Citing Deutsche Bahn's internal crisis plan, Bild newspaper reports that investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned until 2015.
The investment is intended to improve the performance of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of employees involved in clearing snow from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before work begins and 90 percent of the necessary arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of possible cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn had significant difficulties with passenger traffic because it lacked reserves when the weather conditions worsened.
Many new regional trains have been waiting years for approval from the Federal Railroad Service.
There have also been some delays with the ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axles of ICE trains much more frequently over the years after one of the ICE trains broke down at Cologne Main Station.
Deutsche Bank will pay a fine of many millions of pounds in the United States
New troubles followed the unrest around Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a fine in the US of many millions of pounds.
As if Deutsche Bank had had enough problems at home, the industrial giant's past in the US has now caught up with it. The Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes that arose after the bankruptcy of five of its largest credit unions during the financial crisis.
The problem was the sale of the mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
Bonds plummeted during the financial crisis and credit unions were pulled down.
"We are pleased to have resolved this issue without any legal action", said a representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not admit guilt.
The same is true of Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the quick response from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy proceedings to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting for compensation for losses that spill billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also turned its attention to other major banks and in the summer filed a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspicious mortgage bonds are so-called securities backed by a pool of mortgage loans.
They're backed by internal loans.
This was the fate of a number of financial companies when the US housing bubble burst in 2007.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the brink of financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the U.S. are still battling the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a number of lawsuits demanding compensation or punishing fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of complaints .
It accuses 18 of the world's largest banks of buying up about $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities from U.S. lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also facing the threat of a lawsuit from the FHFA over numerous agreements worth a total of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the Frankfurt-based bank to take responsibility for "substantial losses", but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett is putting $10 billion into IBM.
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he's bought more than $10 billion worth of stock.
Until now, the largest investor in the United States, Warren Buffett, has always said that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM's annual report changed his mind about investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realized much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investments were seen as a chivalrous gesture.
IBM, the veteran of the IT industry, now has the title of "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business television channel CNBC, Buffett said that since March he has acquired IBM shares worth a total of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest holders of IBM shares with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know anything about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management for being profitable even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job", Buffett said, referring to the management's strategy.
For a significant period of time, IBM was focused on high-yield IT services such as data centers.
The computer pioneer, now over 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided tech companies.
He claimed he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
And invested in, for example, freight rail, lubricants and engineering.
His Berkshire Hathaway holding company owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old bought a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s and built one of the world's most expensive companies on its foundation with skillful investments.
His lifestyle, however, remained modest,
Making him a cult figure to countless investors around the world.
His almost unerring instinct for making money earned him the nickname "Oracles of Omaha".
IBM's stock price rose one percent before the markets opened after Buffett's investment announcement.
The "Blue Giant", as IBM is also known, is valued at over $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable high-tech companies in the world, alongside Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The danger is imminent
After the Zwickau cell was discovered, Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One newspaper reports that "bloody ideology" is now resurfacing.
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been the reaction to this news in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has revived long-forgotten fears, as there have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the fires in Mellen in November 1992 and Zollingen in May 1993.
It was never in doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered is of a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"Revival of bloody ideology?" was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret intelligence informant and expresses concern that the German authorities may be involved in a right-wing swamp.
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly by commemorating the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket outside the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour agreement at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
The cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
"Gifts from Germany for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet portal Haber X, which commented on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German newspaper Hürriyet also made the parallel.
"Starting to smell bad" is the title of a column by Ahmed Qulalji.
He notes that people who paid taxes and contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The police's behavior and the subsequent successful raid were sharply criticized on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities hadn't thought of tracking suspicious individuals in right-wing extremist circles sooner.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh rhetoric: "If they continue to act as clumsily as they have, migrants will have no choice but to use weapons in self-defense".
"It would be the best self-defense".
"The peace in Germany is very much dependent on the network being uncovered and the legality of punishment", says Selen.
The crimes in Mellen and Zollingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to peace in Germany.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zollingen has been deeply imprinted in the memory of Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that danger is looming, and the Germans that distrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Don 't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time mainly condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks.
He sent a telegram of condolence to the President of Turkey after the arson in Zollingen, but the participation in the memorial ceremony in Cologne was received by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech counted the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It's as if he was measuring a man's worth by the taxes he paid.
The recent coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how deeply distrusted many German Turks have been of the current German state.
By clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
The bank scandal at Lake Zurich
Most of Europe's most risky banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been battling one crisis after another ever since.
Now it's up to the German to get it back on course.
Alex Weber probably didn't know he was getting this part.
In July, after his spectacular resignation as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would take up the equally spectacular post of Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Alex Weber was clearly delighted, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to change for the better".
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel".
But by September, it was clear that things would be very different.
UBS trader in London bypassed the bank's security system and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to step down.
Since then, the chairman of UBS has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And as the bank announced Tuesday, he will take over as chairman in May, not 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He's an economics professor and a central bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he'll definitely need time to adjust.
He was suddenly in charge of the bank's strategy, which once again proved that it had long since earned the title of "Europe's biggest banking scandal".
UBS, on the one hand, is very big -- until recently it managed the largest assets in the world -- and on the other hand, it's been in scandal for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank is sparing nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank combined the image of a stealthy and resilient, yet agile asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed $1.6 billion, thus having more wealthy client money under management than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, it's one of the largest banks in the world.
It was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking who has long taught at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: "I always used UBS as a model for my students to look at as a good bank".
"Knowing what we know now, you may ask how I could have been so wrong".
He was really wrong.
It wasn't until 2007 that it became clear that something was very wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, executive director Peter Woofley - who was considered a prominent intellectual and equally brilliant banker - unexpectedly resigned from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment arm of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The bank did manage to find investors -- but investors that many bankers would have politely turned down not so long ago -- one very opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign wealth fund so secretive that it didn't even reveal its name.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and board chairman Marcel Opel - the second highest-paid board chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned.
In October 2008, UBS was facing a financial crisis and the government had to bail it out.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an undisclosed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of the establishment of huge banks in a small country.
After all, UBS' 2007 balance sheet was five times the size of all Swiss production (see chart).
"We cannot save UBS a second time", says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the United States and said it was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers who may have used the bank to evade taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of compensation for unjustified business income plus penalties.
UBS thus more or less admitted that it was a tax avoidance tool.
At the same time, UBS lost what was always its advantage in the fight for rich clients, the veil of secrecy.
After that scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was not what it used to be.
The CEO and Chairman of the Board have since resigned, and
The customer's money is running out.
In a matter of months, the bank lost credibility in both of its main areas of activity - in investing because of unsuccessful speculation and in asset management because of aid and encouragement to tax evasion.
And then things calmed down and it seemed that UBS had managed to turn the tide, like this whole scammer-trader disaster, where a single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized something was wrong.
One thing's for sure, risk management in the investment department isn't working yet.
"The Adobe incident clearly showed that risk controls have not changed enough", says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of one of Germany's largest banks is equally convinced: "The problem with UBS is that it lacks the tools to control risks".
It is prudence that has long made Swiss bankers custodians of the world's greatest assets - not unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether the world outside the Alpine republic is falling apart or not.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli are a symbol of refined taste in chocolate.
UBS' Zurich headquarters still resembles a respectable Swiss private bank, only slightly larger.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich on the Banhofshtraße, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by the snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli include jewelry firms such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Crédit Suisse and elite private banks like Julius Baer.
The heavy door leads to the lobby of UBS.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather couches, and next to the bank's emblem is a large sign that reads "Safe".
UBS knows what its clients need, reliability.
But both of Switzerland's largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss concepts of banking - or, as the head of one of the smaller Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he also works with the two biggest banks.
He believes UBS has become too big - particularly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons are very active.
He thinks the Swiss have nothing to add.
"And if anything, they must have adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs long ago".
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that transformed UBS, bringing it its first big profits and then a fiasco.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country of seven million people launched the largest rescue operation in the country's history", writes Lucas Hassig in his book UBS Crash.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you ask Swiss banks, they'll say the problem is mainly UBS' size.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which at the time of the merger was already too big for small Switzerland, and a bank that continued to grow.
And it helped that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other, one was a wealthy but prestigious bank in Zurich specializing in asset management, the other was not so wealthy but much more internationalised.
The internationalized investment bankers suddenly had access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with UBS's growth: Peter Woolfley, UBS Group Executive Director from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Opel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wolffley and Opel were a dream team", says banking analyst Hans Geiger.
"Woolfley, a brilliant intellectual, "a modest and deeply understanding of patterns and statistics, and Opel, with his instinct, "who has come all the way up from an intern at the bank".
But Opel finally fell for Woolfley.
"He thought his models were real", says Geiger.
"This is tragic".
Maybe this is tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the board meetings where Woolfley always repeated the same slogan - move Goldman Sachs.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was leading the tournament table, which was dominated by the success of banks.
UBS wanted to be at the top of the table.
He was able to make it part of the way.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
The authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot: UBS was far behind the largest banks in terms of what is known in banking terminology as "fixed income".
UBS has had failures in American mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank and its hedge fund invested in U.S. sub-standard securities.
It evolved into a big mechanism that consolidated securities based on U.S. mortgages and sold them on - continuing to bear the risks itself.
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS did not stop.
"UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market was already on fire", says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher you rise, the deeper you fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to put the bank in order proved to be more difficult than first thought.
UBS positions have become child's play with chairs and remain unreliable to this day.
Whoever heads this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has an idea - to give up investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activity needs to be significantly stimulated.
The bank's new head, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually seen only as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with his predecessor Grubel.
He has shown character over the years and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in the mid-1990s.
He's cutting 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These are questions that Axel Weber must be asking himself.
All he's said publicly so far is that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
- Next year.
European recession fears are driving the US stock market down.
The impending recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors earlier in the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dampened hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in its infancy.
The general relief that followed the change of governments in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems are coming back to the fore, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
The financial markets, in particular, were on the list of sales.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 12,078, down 0.6 percent.
The market barometer during the auction fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 closed at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology index has lost 0.8 percent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax fell 1.2 percent to close at 5,985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting to the end of growth.

"We are not on an island, we are dependent on them", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe was unlikely to recover quickly from recession and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed these fears, saying in an interview with CNBC that it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do what is needed to end the crisis.
He therefore believes it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw away a decades-old principle and invested in American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM of more than ten billion dollars raised the stock price of this oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The stock closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Smart crows filling cities
The crow is considered a problem bird in many places, and experts now say that it is impossible to drive these highly intelligent birds out of the cities.
Some people love birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining of dirt and noise are increasing in many settlements.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from being reached.
At the first crow symposium in Ler, East Frisia, experts argued that it was no longer possible to drive the crows out of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of highly protected crickets, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, building, and cutting down traditional trees for nesting made life difficult for the birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest at Yever, Dipholz, Achim near Bremen and Ler there are large colonies with over 600 parent pairs.
The controversial project to shoot crows in Leer caused unfavourable headlines in 2005.
Critics described the trapping of birds and the beating of them with sticks as particularly cruel.
"The usual movement and intimidation is useless", said architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Ler.
Destroying nests with water or cutting down trees often has unintended consequences, said environmentalist Manfred Kaiser of Larr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals disperse, and the large colonies divide and spread to other areas".
In addition, the scare may only be used in exceptional circumstances near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them.
The problem of cities is not solved by being isolated from the surrounding areas, says Lera Mayor Wolfgang Kellner.
A combination of scaring birds away from areas in need of protection and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a solution.
"Information stands instead of gasoline drums" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident in order to live with this problem".
Juergens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Acherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of very intelligent crows.
The project is already attracting tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion about complaints about noise made by birds: "Noise conveys a lot of information.
The birds' intelligence and cunning have become legendary, and the birds often use tools to grab a piece of meat, but they also make their own.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the measurement of a bird's brain on four bats.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to knock on the board to get the moth.
Without any special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the plank.
In another experiment, the intelligent bats had to solve a more difficult problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket of moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get to the prey with their beaks.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and used the hooks to attach the bucket to the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four grasshoppers did it on the first try.
Ronaldo leads Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for victory at the last minute were long gone.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will compete in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland finished last in the Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine.
Under superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in the 8th and 53rd minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1), perfecting their fifth appearance at Euro after a 0-0 draw in the first leg.
The Czechs were 1-0 (0:0) in the second round of the playoffs against outsider Montenegro after a clean victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily achieved the score 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Neler Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga player Zvezdan Misimović and captain Emir Spahić reduced the difference by two points thanks to a penalty in the 41st minute and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Senna Lulich got the second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal had already knocked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal have made a great start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo took an early start, striking the goal with a free kick from about 30 metres.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-range ability, increasing the score from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who had not opened the scoring in the first half hour, got their first chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player from English championship leader Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball head to the bottom of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Yiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Then the spotlight turned to Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding .
Following the attack on Elder Postig in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was faking, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for a foul-playing hand to Fabio Kuentran - Misimovich delivered it.
After the break, the 2004 European champions secured the score with four more goals.
Peter Jiráček dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions are going to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled on coach Mikhail Bilek's team and Bundesliga legends Michael Kadlets (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Pekkhart (Nürnberg F.C.) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech on the 9th minute prevented a potential autogol by Tomáš Sivok thanks to an instant reflex.
Montenegro had the best chances when Stevan Yovetic and Dejan Damjanovich were on the field.
Damjanovic hit from the penalty area in the 40th minute and almost scored a goal for the Czech.
After the break, the staff saved the already battered world-class goalkeeper Czech after the forward of Seoul FC left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked footballing happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is now almost no doubt that national coach Gus Hiddink will now clear a place on the bench for the team that finished third in 2002, the Croats are in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks were able to start almost perfectly in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maxim Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long-range shot in the seventh minute hit the stand, and forward Kazim Kazim failed to return the ball into the net.
Croatia woke up and took control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga champions Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Shildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field alongside Mario Mandzukic from Wolfsburg, who gave up to Dortmund's Ivan Perišić on the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first appearance at Euro after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - which had already looked confident in their place after a 4-0 win in the first leg - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal by Steven Ward.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the guest team equalised the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland had a good start, but it wasn't until the 23rd minute that Robbie Keane of Los Angeles made the first clean sheet.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from taking Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing the defense of goalkeeper Paul Londak, Ward was in the right place and, letting the ball through the line, changed the score to 1:0.

Mass Murder - The Human Dimension
Peter Englund's tense and very kind new book, Beauty and Sorrow: A Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of characters that makes your heart go cold.
Here's a tip for further reading: Carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund tells the story, and this list of people will be your GPS, your beacon in those moments when, like one of these men and women, you stray off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's writing now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "a work on anti-history".
There are few famous names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, clever journalists, or discussions of tactics and military equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened", he explains, "but a book about what it was like". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods".
Beauty and Sorrow weaves together the experiences of 20 years of war, of more or less unremarkable men and women, on both sides of the front lines, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone will be captured, lose an arm or a leg, go crazy or die.
Their lives flash here like church candles: new ones are added to the many others, and some are extinguished in the process.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It's also a correction to the notion that World War I was just a hard trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are being attacked by bees; one of them is celebrating Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is the tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War is covering these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like smokeless gunpowder.
When you're a woman and you're at home with your kids and you hear a cannonade, will you stay put or run?
Who's coming, anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on or why we should be fighting this war.
"The lack of facts", notes Mr. Englund, "is filled with speculation, speculation, hope, fear, obsession, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the lives of Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs, letters and other material that has already been published.
The stories of their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are extremely vivid thanks to the small moments and fragmentary details collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to cope.
He tells the story of a German schoolgirl, and he says, "Erzaz, erzaz everywhere".
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons" is what they say.
He keeps talking about the Erzsá food in Germany.
He describes "meat of pressed rice cooked in lamb fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes struck with wood".
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American man, who recognizes his own urge for cruelty, says of war: "You feel that, after all, that is what men were made for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey and a nightly newspaper or a best-seller and claim that this display is civilization and that there is no barbarian under your starched shirt with the cuffs".
The British soldier, on the other hand, notices that he will most likely die and no one will notice or feel bad.
"When you accept the idea of self-sacrifice, you want to think that it will be in public", he writes.
But it's the opposite, it's like a convict being hanged in secret.
Other comments concern the old Europe that is falling apart and new forms of fear.
"Conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition", writes Mr. Englund, "a war of factories".
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the new century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-sewn suit who carries out a massacre at his desk".
People act in unexpected ways: lowly acts are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund told of soldiers who tried everything to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes to avoid serving on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this is the trade in the gonorrheal pus that soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting into the hospital", he writes.
"The desperate rubbed his eyes, often leading to blindness for life".
Translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible but unpretentious, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war "unleashed forces beyond our control: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leaders are making them go to war.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, like Paul Fassel's The Great War and Modern Memory or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's On the Western Front Without Change, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unorthodox pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in nonfiction.
I'm not gonna tell you.
But it's like he reached out from a book to a page with a list of characters, snatched it from your hand and lit it with a match.
After the previous mistake , a carefully calculated raid .
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some wearing protective helmets.
The curfew from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park was supposed to be the least crowded.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few senior officers, the others being told at first that they were going on a training mission.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the action, his presence underscoring the importance the police department attached to the operation.
There was no question of a repeat of the events of the past few weeks, such as the pepper spraying against protesters, which violated departmental regulations and caused a storm of public sympathy for the occupation.
So after two weeks of planning and training, the police operation to free Zuccotti Park from the protesters began.
The authorities prepared by watching the occupation unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randall's Island with Zuccotti in mind.
Authorities have increased the number of so-called riot drills - counterterrorism measures that require the rapid movement of large numbers of police - in the Lower Manhattan area.
The last training was Monday night on the East River side of Manhattan.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute", said a source familiar with the orders, which only mentioned the assignment as "training".
"The few cops I know who were called to the case were not told they were being sent to Zuccotti Park", said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zuccotti Park were in the highest positions in the department".
One of the reasons for the secrecy was a lesson the city learned.
On October 14, authorities wanted to clear the park, but backed down in front of hundreds of protesters who had flocked in ahead of schedule after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including forces from the districts - police teams that are usually used to control criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and go from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to strike.
"It was the right thing to do when the park was the least crowded", he said.
Emergency vehicles with searchlights and speakers, gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spotlights and pre-recorded announcements from loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When officers from the administrative units entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters simply packed up and left.
Police said the tents were not moved until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack.
Other police teams, according to eyewitnesses, were gathering around the perimeter to go inside in case arrests were needed in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the police department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists say they were not given a chance to see the police work and that they were treated harshly by the police.
Mr. Brown said that the cars with the TV cameras on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could have taken the picture.
As police walked west through a pile of protesters' personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags, full of clothes, Sanitation Department teams followed her, collecting what was left.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, and photos of this soon appeared online.
The main group of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen, near the center of the park.
Some set up barricades, and the police went in, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied themselves together by the hands.
And two men chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Rescue workers were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleanup operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said that approximately 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "disturbing public order and resisting arrest", he said.
The highest ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and the senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department's detective department, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operation", Mr. Brown said.
A second team of officers was standing by along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case we needed to go inside.
The fences were placed on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, the police were seen to expand the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police, many with shields, pushing the crowd further away.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one protester jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, witnesses said, blew air out of the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
Schools ' service personnel union is suing the city for dismissal
The union, which represents hundreds of school service workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools with poor students.
A lawsuit is probably the last resort for the union of the 37th District Council trying to get rid of the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a parent-service coordinator and other employees who were among the city's lowest-paid workers lost their jobs on October 7 in what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to health funds run by workers' groups to fill a budget gap last spring.
City officials have categorically denied the allegation.
At a City Council hearing last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget they signed in June.
One of the board members parried, telling him that there was no provision in the budget that school support staff would be laid off.
Representatives of the 37th District Council said they had filed a notice of complaints, warning the Department of Education that it was being sued; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the lawsuit in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will name Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and list eight temporary employees as plaintiffs, all black or Hispanic women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not seen the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint obtained by The New York Times, the union focused on a series of layoffs at schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and few in the Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school support workers lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants at Harlem's free high school, 36, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: "These are not neighborhoods where wealthy parents can find money to make up for budget shortfalls".
P.S. 36's budget was cut 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated the additional funding for every poor student who attends school.
The union also claims that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice authorizing the dismissal of the parent coordinators.
The notice used the word "overage", although "overage" is more commonly said when a teacher is moved from the school payroll to a list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six of the parents' coordinators were fired", the lawsuit states, "not just transferred".
Mission accomplished, Congress is ready to agree on Libya.
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the uprising to succeed, for longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for American intervention to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut) that praises the Libyans for a successful uprising and American troops for "bravery".
"The purpose of this resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic aspirations from both parties".
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has ever been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties have been fighting with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or denouncing the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing limited use of U.S. forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives with a significant majority of both parties and never made it to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also rejected a proposal that would have cut funding for the American operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in a sort of legislative purgatory -- where Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually kick the ground out of its feet.
Then events overwhelmed the Congress's indecision.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
NATO's mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate can be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution "admires the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary resilience in their quest for freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measures gain the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or will they split lawmakers like the June bill?
The latter version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader on the Committee.
Representative Luger said Monday he hasn't seen the final version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, the top legislative priority for almost every Republican and some Democrats in Congress.
The measure, proposed by House Representative Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote in Congress this term.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to get their amendments through the House, but not because they haven't tried.
The Goodlat Amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that were introduced in this convention.
Some were duplicates - the same bill was introduced in the House and Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House alone and a few more on "control of federal spending".
Some of them are identical, too, but they give their authors - mostly newly elected Republicans who want to embellish their résumés - the opportunity to brag that they "proposed" such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms members of Congress serve, and House member Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to repeal the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed many amendments guaranteeing, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for years, as has another banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
As much as members of Congress have been eager to propose amendments, they are not moving as fast as they have in years past.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th Congress, they introduced 66.
That's a far cry from the early 1990s, when members of Congress regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the Senate Library.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was passed, the 27th, was passed in 1992, but when it was introduced in Congress, it was actually in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated", says Giffords in her first television interview since the assassination attempt.
Ten months after a gunman shot her in the face at a public event in Tucson, House Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday night, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Comes Back Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get better than to return to Congress.
After appearing on ABC News's "20/20" with Diana Sawyer, Giffords had trouble forming sentences and needed help walking.
The program showed her the difficult path to recovery from a bullet wound that shattered her skull and punctured the left side of her brain, going from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the debt limit bill.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When asked by Sawyer how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords said: "Very well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour special "20/20" that aired ahead of the release of the couple's new book, Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
The special reported on Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In the videos Kelly took in the first few weeks, she's lying in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords in a wheelchair, as physical therapists teach her how to perform simple tasks.
Shake your head.
Spread your lips.
And then her first word was, "What".
A few days later, Giffords uttered the second word, "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery, as we see the congressman singing along with doctors to Cindy Lauper's "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fall".
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she doesn't remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed that day.
Suspected assailant, Jared Lee Lafner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is undergoing forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died", said Giffords Sawyer.
"Heavy, heavy, heavy" is what I'm saying.
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I'm defeated".
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just beat up.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
The troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was a celebration on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marines lined up around him.
The audience in tuxedos applauded him standing up.
"The military was seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which also included the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The very opposite experience illustrates the difficult relationship that has developed between the military and the often indifferent, sometimes admiring, American public.
The troops are being praised for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, military men say.
The public is acting more and more like they feel sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not victims", said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon to leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like we're unhappy".
It's a sensitive subject for military leaders who don't want to look ungrateful or disagreeable to the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the returning troops faced in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, most compassionate conversations are quiet and only between veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat duty in the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Kenshan warned them that non-military men would view their service from two points of view.
Some will look on with admiration because they have crushed the rebels and have been to exotic places.
Others will wonder if "under the mask of a vicious evil veteran", said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high government post in Washington.
While looking for work, he says, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could handle the stress of a responsible job in Washington right after the war.
Kenshin recalls telling his sons: "When you talk about your ministry, you should expect negative effects".
The embarrassment the military experiences is partly due to American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield rarely gets the credit of a country that has little military experience and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism in the way that it was in World War II", says retired Lt. Gen. David Barnow, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mostly focused on the depth of the soldier's suffering.
Troops are judged by the number of campaigns they've made, the number of comrades they've lost, or the scale of the losses.
The Army is facing increasing pressure from rape prevention groups .
This week, a historic court hearing is scheduled to decide whether to take 28 men and women to court against the military on charges of failing to prevent rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be lining up with the next one.
Private Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, was allegedly raped by her colleague at night.
It was October 2008, and she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, when she met a male colleague carrying a pack of 12 beers.
He asked if he could come in her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag", Lyman says.
But the Texas native has put her fears aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I hadn't followed my instincts".
Minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man came up behind her, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former service members will eagerly await a court ruling at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether to take up the lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address widespread violence in the military in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Washington, D.C. lawyer Susan Burke, originally included 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 over the next few months - 25 women and three men, all of whom allege they were raped or threatened with sexual violence by fellow officers and that the military failed to properly investigate, prosecute or provide proper justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the top brass in the army because that's where the problem starts.
"The army is a vertical structure", she says.
"Who are the people who can eradicate the cult of violence?
Burke also says she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy is that instead of bringing all the plaintiffs into this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, she'll open a lot of cases if necessary to keep up the pressure.
A defense team from the Department of Defense led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride has taken steps to close the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy - essentially that former or current soldiers cannot sue the military for damage sustained in the armed forces.
The doctrine, called the Feres Doctrine in the 1950 Supreme Court decision, holds that the federal government is not liable for damages caused by military personnel.
"The alleged harm relates to the risk inherent in the plaintiffs' military service", the documents state.
The DOD declined to comment on the story.
Since the 1950s, things have changed.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division is only verbal: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women's teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacting local women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars, two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to modernize, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against four major military academies on charges of encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
A separate nonprofit organization, the American Veterans of Vietnam, is preparing a lawsuit against the military, which focuses on diagnoses of "altering personality" that are subjected to violence to remove them from service, a common occurrence, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Military Action Organization.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Department of Veterans Affairs, accusing it of discriminatory practices in processing pension claims from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence while on duty.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced in Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Defense Department's Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, there were 3,158 reported rape attempts.
But as we know, attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon itself estimates that this figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases that reached the courts: In 2010, 20 percent of known cases reached the courts - twice as many as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case say the assaults were just the first in a series of injuries.
In Lyman's case, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape 11 separate times to a line of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of rape evidence, and the assailant's blood - from the cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge at a hearing in which she was asked if she had had sex with her boyfriend earlier in the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive review to the defendant, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought I was having a baby, I ran out of the courtroom screaming".
"They put me in the mental ward, and when I came out, I remember my commander saying, 'This wasn't a trial for him.
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with a disfavorable wording, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
Whether the case brought by Lyman and her co-defendants will go forward is a difficult question, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he adds: "I think they are capable of moving forward".
Between them and the verdict is a doctrine that has been criticized since it was first introduced.
I've been a critic of the Ferris Doctrine my whole life.
The army is decades behind because it lacks the incentives and deterrents that make it accountable.
He adds: "The odds are pretty much against them . . . but it's important for them to try".
These things will only change when decent people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will bring in hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform", she says.
Or before we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a regular guy who posted his anti-immigration views online.
Breivik, who confessed to the mass murder in Norway in July that killed 77 people, appeared in his first public court hearing on Monday.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing for the attack behind his computer, interacting with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy, you just have to go on Facebook.
"We found that it was easy to get to them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report on European cyberpopulism by the UK's DEMOS research centre.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to target the right demographic with scientific accuracy - something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing groups across Europe and then put out an advert for them, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the ad asked the user to take a survey that asked questions about their education level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Using Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 participants from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - even without leaving their offices.
"This is a whole new way of doing research", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not as surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are unhappy with immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who combine their online and offline activities are more intelligent, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who hide behind their monitors".
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a popular new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to learn about everything from health issues to social trends expressed in likes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook's "super-reality" is driving a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site's title in the title by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows them to study people who they couldn't reach on the street with a notebook.
"Before, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them".
"You would have to join the party and they would never accept you", says Bartlett.
"Facebook excludes all of that - you're talking to them directly".
Others say that the site could be used to identify and research social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that college students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more likely to become alcoholic than students who kept quiet about it.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as their dorm mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates drunk statuses too often.
"You can't solve a problem without identifying it", said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Children's Research Institute of Seattle.
"We found a way to identify at-risk children who would otherwise be undetected".
Facebook also constantly extracts all kinds of data about its users.
The site's data-processing team processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, as well as the National Happiness Index (mostly using information only they have access to - champions of cyber freedom have long insisted that the site should make its vast data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not -- in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users are taking part in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for doing offline research, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think many users even think about the possibility of a researcher monitoring their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a study he conducted in 2006 using publicly accessible student Facebook pages.
"As far as they knew, it was just between them and their friends".
So there's a question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know how much of the information on a user's profile and page is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things", Selwyn says.
That's why, despite years of technology research, Selvin thinks that a notebook and a pen are still the best research tools you can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people", he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social, and most social still happens offline".
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik is to appear in court for the first time in public
Anders Bering Breivik, the man who confessed to orchestrating the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway", he told 500 people in the courtroom.
"I object to the trial because you got your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I admit to the deed, but I do not admit to the guilt".
Judge Torckel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his own views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would strictly monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman", one survivor told NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but I felt a little better after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing, and looked into the eyes of reporters and survivors as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik's strange idea that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he was not insane and said there was no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically lessen the grief and confusion that the entire nation is now feeling.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn't", said a relative of one victim.
"It would be so much easier if it were".
7 lessons from the lost Steve Jobs interview that's playing in the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the tech genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans may find the biggest revelation in a recently re-discovered interview, which was recalled ahead of the previews in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and manufacturing technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and modernization of production processes who believed that many business leaders suffered from "the sickness of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea is separated from a great product by a huge amount of skilled labor".
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley was creating a TV series called Triumph of the Nerds about the advent of the personal computer, and he spent over an hour with Jobs in a unique, long conversation.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was fired from Apple, and he was already working at his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the Internet to be mass-produced.
While a small portion of the Kringley interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview were lost in transport.
It wasn't until after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which opens at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually willing to lay out his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are long gaps between questions and answers -- 10-15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by the questions of Kringley, causing him to move quickly to more important issues or phenomena.
In this pre-Pixar, iPod, and iPhone-era Lost interview, there's something ominously prophetic about how Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision for the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about the posthumous reviews of Jobs' work, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here, a restless dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A little summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All my time in business, I've been asking, "Why do you do this?" and the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done".
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks business very deeply.
Here's what I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe in detail his attempts to streamline reporting at Apple.
Frustrated by the way the cost records often started with "standard expenses" that were taken from the ceiling and then adjusted with "specification", he created an automated structure that ensured they could track business expenses down to the smallest detail.
About the Pope joke:
Jobs goes into great detail about the "blue box" he designed with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
The device has been written about before, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a pay phone, ordering a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've been around the globe half a dozen times, and you're yelling at a pay phone, and it's coming in a minute later at the next pay phone", Jobs says with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could engineer something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We both knew a little bit, but we could engineer a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple could ever have come about without that.
Jobs goes on to describe one famous stunt that he and Wozniak almost pulled off, calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to take the phone, trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst out laughing just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About being in love with technology (and Bill Hewlett's cold calling):
At the age of 12, while hunting for spare parts to assemble a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a big impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees".
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer".
It was the size of a suitcase, and it had a little monitor with a beam tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to go to HP a lot as a teenager and I used to go around that machine and write programs for it.
About the improvised innovation:
In several of his interviews, Jobs talks about inventing new products for flight.
At the beginning of his career, when he was selling a handful of assembly boards, a customer asked him to assemble a whole computer.
With only 30 days on credit, he had to figure out how to assemble and deliver the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the heated arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to assemble a mouse that would cost $300], and I was so full, I went out and found a designer".
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could assemble for 15 dollars, which was incredibly reliable.
About the big companies losing power:
Long before he led the Apple revival, Jobs accurately predicted how many industry leaders would misjudge the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who end up in the leadership of companies, and the people who make the product are pushed out of the decision-making platform.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is being displaced by people who have no idea about the difference between good and bad products -- the skill required.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire IT industry.
It could be ten times bigger, it could be Microsoft in the '90s...
They got defeated by victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"A great idea is separated from a great product by a tremendous amount of skillful work... when you unwind a great idea, it changes and grows".
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are tradeoffs you have to make -- some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- and connect them all together...
It's all about taste, it's all about trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and then later trying to bring that into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made the Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it weren't for information technology, they would be doing amazing things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with health care opponents while the court is in session.
On the day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious issue of whether to hear President Obama's health care law challenge, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were honored at a luncheon sponsored by the law firm that will be challenging the case before the Supreme Court.
This case occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One of the items on the agenda was a petition backed by 26 states challenging a sweeping health care overhaul passed by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists from across the nation.
The judges agreed to review the case; in fact, a 5 1/2 hour turnaround is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be a setback for the presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was deputy attorney general under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual luncheon of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that consistently advocates conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The luncheon was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court hearing.
Among those present was Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader and a known opponent of the health care law.
The guests of honor at the dinner?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And that's not against ethics at all.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they did, they might fall under Principle 4C of the code, which states, "A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or be mentioned in the program of such events".
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal to ethic activists in the government.
"This staggering violation of ethics and disregard for the code contradicts claims by some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Pleas.
"Judges were drinking and dining at a formal fundraiser with lawyers whose cases are now in court".
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they are quite willing to mix court cases with the cases of groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is the ethical question that arises with respect to Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were filed at the trial court level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show any sign of what she was going to do.
Boeing gets a record $ 18 billion order for planes .
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777s and may order 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company is getting orders for 50 of its products.
But this is a big deal when this company is Boeing Co., and the price tag for all 50 planes is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future orders for aircraft.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest dollar-equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777s.
An incredible order came in from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total price tag to $26 billion, Boeing said at the Dubai Airshow 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The price tag for six planes will be over $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neil Diora.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high".
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have money to pay for planes, but the fuel price increase, which usually hurts the airlines because it's one of their biggest expenses, is not so bad because the country makes money off of high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel aircraft orders when prices rise, Dior said.
"They have a natural defense", he said.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps to prevent attempts by rival Airbus SAS to encroach on its dominance with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's win at the airshow came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of its largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
It delayed its debut to increase axle load after buyers demanded increased payload and range.
Boeing Co. stock is up 1.5% to $67.94.
The president's sister apparently lost the election in Michoacan.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have failed to make her bid for the governor's seat in Michoacan during a bitter state election, and she said on Monday that drug dealers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results show Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, leading the race for governor of the western state.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country", said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday's vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the election... they grabbed the ballot boxes, put obstacles... and made people vote" for the IRP.
The IDP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
She's preparing to return, and winning the Michoacan is a major step in that effort.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Valliho seems to have just slightly edged Calderon, who was leading the ratings before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or NAP, led by her brother, refused to recognize Valjeho as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate from the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now holds the governorship seat, came in third - a major defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Valliehò, a former mayor of the state capital of Morella, denied any ties to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
The PND mayor was killed a week before the election when he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and several candidates withdrew from the local race out of fear.
For the IRP, however, as terrible as the Michoacán election may have looked, the party's driving force will be victory.
The man who is supposed to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallijo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year".
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would halt Asian economic growth.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB's Manila office, said the two fastest-growing major economies should "do everything they can" to accelerate the currency bloc's recovery through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRICS countries were looking at Europe's difficulties "impartially", and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"This is about all of us".
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be somewhat protected, but it cannot be invulnerable".
"So if China and India can help, they should".
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing has risen alarmingly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The unfolding debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the world economy back into recession, and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian aid would be through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- like buying EU bailout bonds, a means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- gives a huge bargaining power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign investment.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unrestful", he said.
"We have a huge challenge and we need to maintain high growth rates".
"It's not an option, it's a requirement, because that's where we're going to get jobs for tens of millions of our boys and girls".
Others argue that there is no point for emerging economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be very difficult from a political point of view to provide aid to Europe for India's 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go to the seaside for holidays, and it will not be well received", he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep Greek large and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, unprofitable enterprises such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened "significant direct consequences" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast for 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing "downside risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to make "emergency plans" to protect themselves from recessions and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon 's dire warnings about potential defense spending cuts .
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up the situation Monday in Congress, warning that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to a $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress cannot agree on spending.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to pass a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration would trigger a 23% overall cut and shut down many new projects.
"Such a drastic cut, applied so thoughtlessly, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unworkable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and would seriously damage other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also have to lay off many of our full-time employees, and since the reduction will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off full-time employees to achieve our goal".
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our military and seriously damage our readiness".
The cuts will ultimately affect the military, Panetta said.
"While the military funding of foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequester, military gains will be severely affected by a major disruption in the main budgets", Panetta warned.
"Contract personnel will be cut, which will end up cancelling the contracts and the surveillance agreement that supports the troops".
"Personnel will be cut, which will delay payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted".
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The result of the sequester at the Department of Defense will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We stand firm against these draconian actions", the senators said in a joint statement Monday night when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a solution we can live with, and it's not a solution we should force on ourselves".
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it cannot be allowed to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter or the senators' latest warnings lead to a budget compromise or reinforce calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts, we'll see later.
Panetta was completely honest about the potential cuts, even though he came to the Pentagon after years of budgeting in Congress and the White House and realizing he was facing a tough choice.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what could happen next -- shell-based but no-nuclear forces.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"This is a team without bullets".
"It's a wing of an airplane without adequate training".
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor preparedness and inability to fight potential enemies".
"It's actually encouraging aggression".
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he voiced new details of how the cuts "generate significant operational risks: slow down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed testing, and some that are only in the early planning stages.
This list includes the F35 single-seat fighter, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone warship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the Hummer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion over 10 years, but its proponents say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to catch a liar
A quick glance at the latest headlines shows just how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in our daily lives.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy contesting sexual harassment allegations from multiple women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration has been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing that a retired football coach molested boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught speaking to US President Barack Obama over a microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying destroys careers and shakes up nations.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by denying his pranks, which were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance fraud related to the cover-up of extramarital affairs.
And again, no one alive at the time will ever forget the media circus of President Bill Clinton being caught lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of cheating on school and college exams are common.
There were instances when teachers gave students answers to tests so that they could evaluate their performance.
The teachers who are supposed to teach the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
Studies show that you lie an average of 10 to 200 times a day.
Now it's assumed that a significant portion of this is a lie to save face.
Another study found that strangers lie an average of three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Lying detection or detection is a skill that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game of, say, charades where you have to shout, "I've got you!" lie detection is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush, or fuss.
This does not mean that lying is hard to spot or unmask.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by observing the structure of statements, facial expressions, question structure, and time characteristics.
I've spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lying, and it's clear that lie detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and that helps you navigate our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating, or management.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel relaxed, managing their own emotions, and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves than women do about others, usually to protect someone's feelings, that married people lie less to their partners than single people do (but the lies they tell are usually the most outrageous).
We also know that if you're perceived as a cheater, others will feel less guilty about cheating on you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
It's called "state definition".
This helps provide a starting point for evaluating changes further.
Watch the posture, the laughter, the voice characteristics of your subject.
You'd better know if the person is regularly tapping his feet in a normal state, so you don't make unfair accusations when you see a tapping in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceitful verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Liars can focus on their upper body when they're trying to remember their story, they can put their feet toward the door, they can lean toward the exit, they can change their posture in a certain way, or they can show "relief after the interview" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when all the hard questions are behind them.
Investigators often fake the end of interrogation signal just to look at that relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your subject.
Scott Peterson is known to have tripped and used the past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, leading to a nationwide manhunt.
Pushing people may also use distance in speech, such as "I did not have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeating a difficult question in full.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely noticeable.
Someone might use "qualification language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... actually... as far as I know... as far as I know".
This makes the response more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic bullet to detect lies, but you can master the skill of detecting deception.
These skills will increase the chances of anyone avoiding being a victim of skilled scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan needs to be revised after the US threatened to delay its approval .
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering unions but reassuring environmentalists -- a company that was going to build the pipeline says it would be willing to review the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it would remove a planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and is confident the project will still be approved.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay a federal decision on the project until it explored new possible routes that do not involve the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward", said Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
A new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to delay a decision until 2013, after the election next year, though authorities have denied that politics was involved.
Obama in a written statement last week called the decision a call from the State Department, and expressed support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline is supposed to run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It's supposed to move 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, he's got to cross six states.
It's hated by environmentalists, but loved by unions who hope to create some 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering a bill to speed up the relocation of the Sandhills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
A recent State Department environmental impact study found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the Department's auditor ordered a separate review of the review process, focusing on two issues.
- Whether or not a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the original study was inappropriate, since it was affiliated with TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle was sued for allegedly causing a child to feel fearful and nauseous.
The New York family claims that disco star Patty LaBelle started a riot in the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their young daughter to the point that she threw up in fear.
The Lady Marmalade's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "a severe fear of strangers", her family said in Manhattan Superior Court.
It happened on November 10th of last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of a building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter's doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and I went to get her", she said.
LaBelle angrily reprimanded the pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door,'" said Rosanne Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started using profanity -- the C word and the F word -- in a high pitched tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the mother said.
LaBelle jumped on her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her bodyguards had to hold her down and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby was crying so hard that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a note demanding an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives are not answering calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not disclosed, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money they receive to a charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to hold Patty LaBelle accountable for her actions", Davis said.
"This is totally unacceptable behavior, especially for a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in her arms".
Climate problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez's rule, Sinaloa's unemployment and illegal labor market increased, foreign funding decreased, and the economy was weakened.
2011 is the year that will go down in Sinaloa's economic history as the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdés, also called the year of change, which raised great hopes for economic development, but given the unfavorable climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth, however, there was a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The February cold temperatures not only cost the agricultural sector millions, but they also limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, causing economic activity to decline by 3.6 percent overall in the first half of the year, mainly due to a historic 31.16 percent drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on the areas affected by the frost provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 percent were affected in whole and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters there was an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55,053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share increased to 5.28 percent, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19 percent, a share that in terms of the number of people is more than 74,000 Sinaloa unemployed residents, which is 18.969 people more compared to the first half.
Liquidity decline
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year has been driven by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions that were taken in public policy.
"What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment that is linked to several factors, including a loss of liquidity in the market to limit resources imposed by a law that was passed in Congress to fight money laundering, because people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with, invest and use for anything", he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopez Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state to look for work abroad in the U.S. has been limited, firstly because of the difficulty of entry, and secondly because once they enter, they already face a lot of difficulties in finding work, so a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, and as a result, the unemployment rate is rising", he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Sinaloa's labour market analysis is made worse when one considers the high number of violations that are prevalent in the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population of the state works without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularities in registration, another reminder of working in the state is low wages; the state has the lowest salaries in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos until September, far below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reducing FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment, 2011 saw the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Treasury Department, with January-July FDI totaling $630,697, showing a 87.74 percent drop from $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the state government's Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which was mainly in the service sector.
The debt
Amid the economic downturn, the state government requested approval of a 3 billion peso loan in July during the state congress to be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2.600 million pesos were approved locally, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business people, the first year of the Mario Lopez Valdes government demonstrates the government's lack of capacity.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was a lack of coordination among various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The economic efficiency in Sinaloa this year has been really low, we have to work hard to regain the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of everyone and above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better", he said.
The slowdown in the economy
Lopez Loredo said events such as early freezes have brought the state's economy to a halt this year and limited its efficiency and growth.
"The low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not getting fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and therefore at the end of the year we close it below our expectations", he said.
Revisiting the direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needed to continue its most dynamic manufacturing activity.
"In general, we found that we worked on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has", he said.
The work ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction to better direct the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program", he said.
He noted that the current administration has demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved and that I can say that some work has been done and I think the government is aware that there is still a lot to do", he said.
He 's being sentenced for eight kilos of marijuana .
Five years in prison and a fine equal to 100 days' income - this was the sentence imposed on a citizen of Navolato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The prosecutor general's office said the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, was convicted of a health crime, in this case possession of marijuana for distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on June 7, 2010 while patrolling Cipriano Valdés Street, outside checkpoint 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck, which he was carrying a black bag in a drawer in the car, and a small backpack in the passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was turned over to the Second District Court, and the defendant remains incarcerated at the Criminal Justice Support Center.
You gotta contribute to the work.
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Rescue Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk being left unfinished or delayed for a long time due to lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that although the work programs have evolved so far, they are in danger as the state government is unable to make the appropriate contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programs.
He noted that the total funding of all three programs is about 50 million pesos, of which the state must contribute 25 percent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the work, so there is still a possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is ending, they have not given us a penny, when from the beginning of July they should have given us a part", he said, "so as not to delay, we started work and they have made great progress, but we need money".
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the term of the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn't have the financial capacity to participate, and the programs kept evolving, and this year to access those programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state owes", he explained.
Although the state authorities have an obligation to deliver these resources, he says a request was made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to increase efforts so that the interest related to them comes as quickly as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is ending, they haven't given us a penny".
Court approves "digital television transition" in Mexico in 2015
The switch from analog to digital is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court (Supreme Court) has rejected constitutional claims brought by the Senate and House of Representatives against a presidential decree that postpones the so-called "transition to digital television" from 2021 to 2015 because it did not collect the eight votes needed to overturn it.
A minority of four ministers, including the court's president, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected due to the lack of the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of radio and television programming is a right vested in the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) by law, in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the meeting of ministers it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot determine by general rules the measures to which the state administration should prepare.
"I also don't think that if it did happen, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and reminded that planning public policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to govern the state.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes that has occurred in recent years, leading to better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the transition, he said, would mean delaying the benefits of the digital transformation, which includes meeting societal needs that have more than just a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic management, includes a group of authorities that the Constitution unites into the state executive power".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and have done so with the help of the executive, despite the presence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the government, by passing the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws passed by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacan, they're analyzing the possibility of a voice-by-voice count.
According to the data provided to the PPRV, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the 879 votes in the 6,074 minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote for vote" is real for this year's election process in Michoacán, where, according to the preliminary results program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the 879 votes in the 6,074 minutes.
In this light, the chair of the General Council of the Michoacan Elections Institute (IEM), Maria de Los Angeles Llanderal Saragossa, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a package of principles to harmonize local rules with the federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Voting Rights Act, as the state Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication in the law in the State Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJC) ruled on a constitutional claim brought by the local legislature and called the state representative's vote on constitutional reform "invalid and illegal" as he had no right to "allow or support them".
In an interview about the possibility of "vote by vote", Maria de los Ángeles Lianderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IWM, it would be possible to provide a partial or complete count of votes to the local electoral body.
For example, a partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be made if the results of the voting records do not match; there is no ballot box or the ballot box is not in the chairman's possession; or there are obvious errors or corrections in the ballot box.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all ballot boxes may take place when there is evidence that the difference between the presumed winner of the election and the second-place vote is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the party and/or coalition representative who put up the second of the candidates at the beginning of the session.
A total recount will also be carried out if at the end of the usual count it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took second place is less than or equal to one percent, provided there is a request from the political party whose candidate took second place, in case the ballot boxes that were taken into account in the partial recount are excluded.
It is worth noting that this is the situation in the elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPRV, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even if we do not count 129 votes out of the total of 923 in the protocol.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapaliname, family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortes arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; a viewing and funeral mass was held on Monday.
According to his family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, the Bacio Cortes family returned to the capital city of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, with their loved ones attending the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the colonel's ashes were brought to the chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends were gathered.
At 5:30 p.m., he was examined by the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team that Felipe Bacio was a member of while in high school.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Sapalina, he always told his family and friends", said Sandra Cortes Bassio, the pilot's sister.
She said the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all her dreams, she said he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, son and loving brother, devoted to his family".
Felipe Cortés Basío left Saltillo very young to attend the College of Aviation in Sapopán, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as when he brought Marta Saagún to Saltillo".
He recalls that even when he was seven, he had traveled to Sapopan to attend his relative's graduation ceremony, so he knew that his uncle had died doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
He's being escorted to his final resting place.
Gunfire rang out in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Cortés Basio of the Mexican Air Force, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the directors and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, which he attended in 1985 and excelled in both studies and sports, accompanied him to his final journey.
Bassio Cortes died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the provincial government secretary, Jose Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all from that ministry.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Bacio Cortes (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral home by members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martinez, on the training school's esplanade, where he was already awaiting his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at N.L. Kadareit 's farm .
Hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed the media eleven people who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of their bodies with a control shot at an abandoned farmhouse in the municipality of Cadereita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The find was found 1.5 kilometers off Cadereita Highway towards Santiago, on a hill in the commune known as El Castillo.
Several passersby noticed that the gate of the village house, which had a beige and brown wall, was wide open.
They looked inside, literally 10 feet, and they found three bodies, and they immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Nearly three feet down was another man's body, wearing a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were lying face down.
According to the evidence collected there, three people were killed in another location, as there was no casing at the scene.
There are signs on the fence of the village house that say one organized crime group is targeting another, and there are several bullet holes in the fence and gate.
11 caught in Kaderite.
The Ministry of National Security has identified 11 individuals, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kadereita, and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and secret burials.
According to published information, eight people were initially detained in Los Alveros on November 11, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a telephone, demanding that they become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another incident occurred on November 12 at 06:00 am, military personnel were patrolling the Old Ranch village in Kadereite when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
After stopping them and inspecting them, the military found a rifle, a magazine, and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Terran, Hina and Kadereita.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday .
The new prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present a new government that will face a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic catastrophe.
Italy's newly appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the president on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive branch will take office.
Monty said he would present the president with the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is well laid out now", he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than usual since Italy was struggling with a political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve the austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Under pressure from Monti to hurry, volatile markets set the yield on Italy's 10-year BTP bonds at 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be bailed out.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Employers' Federation, told reporters after meeting with Monty: "We said we would actively support this government".
We believe this government is Italy's last chance to get out of this crisis.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome", Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the LDP, Italy's largest party, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the governmental majority of technocrats that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty government must have strong parliamentary support to implement reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up pressure, warning that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He'll finish his series of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely quick transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief pause at the end of last week when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italy's debt value has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Bailing out Italy with a 1.8 billion euro national debt would be too much for modern eurozone financial protectors.
Monty said his government would last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to reform before calling new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist it should be made up of only technical experts, a testament to their dissatisfaction with the process being affected by the financial situation.
Political sources said that the mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicated the attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more experience than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players who have been called up for Spain, ten have played 50 international matches.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players has played 50 matches.
A small contrast to Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 players called up by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a whole list of A-class qualifying games, the Tricolor only have defender Michael Umman as the only one to have played 50 international matches.
This was achieved last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish footballers playing in the All-Star League and in strong English Premier League clubs have been very active in the league and in local cup competitions during this year, and they are high level players in European Cups and Champions League.
Add to that the Spanish Furia's experience in the difficult qualifiers for Euro or World Cup.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a match they lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarretta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international games for Spain.
Javier Hernandez, the Barcelona player, has 106 games.
Casillas and Xavi were named UEFA's best players last week alongside another Iberian player, Subisarreta, with 126 caps and Schalke's striker Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Carles Puigol is close to a hundred with 97 games.
They are followed by Xavi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andres Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, next to Michael Umana, left-footed defender Junior Diaz with 48 games and striker Brian Ruiz with 45.
Next, only five have crossed the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantez with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The rest.
Gérard Pique has played more than 30 games in Spain (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
The team with fewer than 30 appearances is Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
Whereas Nacho Morales has only four games, and Hordi Alba has two, and Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, Allman Vargas and Nelson Edder have yet to debut.
Spain's leading scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the top scorer, twice as many as Carlos Hernandez and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
The quintet is touring the country for their 20th anniversary .
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.'
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to play one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It's been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says that for them it's also a dream come true to play in this country.
This was the claim of bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is on tour in South America to celebrate their 20th anniversary and will make their only stop in Central America on Sunday, the 20th.
They will perform at the National Stadium starting at 7:30 p.m. with Los Angeles-based The X and local band Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from a conversation that is available online in full at The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far, everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there's a certain loyalty to the band; the fans are living in tension in the days before the show.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, are treating it like the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We did some great shows in São Paulo and we hope that it's got us in shape for this gig in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle, and when it comes to those two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you learn about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves are amazing.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and also to Mexico, which are great places to surf, and that's how we learned about it from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you guys did a great show with a lot of songs.
What are your plans for the Costa Rica show?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limitations on what we can do.
We're going to try to do the best show we can with the most diverse songs; we're going to try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How's that?
I think part of the reason is because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and everybody likes different songs, so it's hard to pick which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played in a while, it keeps us tuned in and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore, I think, makes it more interesting for people.
This tour marks 20 years of your career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe what you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us ever imagined that we'd be in a rock band and the fact that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it feel like a dream.
We're happy with our success and we're very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we all love making music.
We're happy to travel to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
It's going very well for us.
What does it mean to you to be a significant part of the grunge boom?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when a movement starts out as a group of friends, and that's unusual.
Occasionally, one group from one city appears, but it's much stranger when five or ten groups appear in the same city at the same time.
We're proud and honored to be part of a band from Seattle.
I still play with some of them now and then.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and we're honored to be part of the Seattle sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a band like yours can stay together and in the same lineup for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt joined us 13 years ago, which is way longer than most bands.
First, I think we're lucky to be alive, and second, we care about others.
We're all very close friends, and because of that, we also opened up musical paths that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't be better.
Your attitude toward the word fame was not easy, but your success enabled you to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
As we got older, it became easier to find balance.
We make sure that you don't stay on tour too long because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for the music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what made it, not decide to be famous and be a rock star, something none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and didn't release an album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of disappointment because it went on for so long, and the most important thing is that we're still very close friends with Bruce and Greg who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or I see a picture, I think about the incredible person that Andy was, and how he made me laugh, and it was always fun to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so much more.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video suggestions, and this was the band we liked the most, so we can't wait to see what Las Robertas have to offer live, and it should be really exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics at Yellow Ledbetter concerts?
This is a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Some of the first people that come to mind are Gezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
There's so many of them, I could talk all day about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping grunge relevant even though it's out of fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out at the same time, and if that's important now, I think that's great, because it's music worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better than ever.
Your music used to be more somber, but now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that might seem lighter, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, even though they can sound a little positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are so dark.
I think when you're growing up, and you've had some kind of trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, those events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make somber music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination.
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a state hospital on Tuesday for a test for loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four operations and is under observation.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinagá, who is his personal physician, told N TV that Fujimori will be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower extremities.
Aguinagá said that he thought Fujimori should be a candidate for pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want that because he knew he was innocent.
He had four operations for tongue cancer, lost 60 pounds [18 kg], and had other ailments, including severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the army's destruction squad, which operated in secret during the first years of his rule.
Mujica goes to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and comprising several ministers and businessmen will arrive in Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the most important item in a broad plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to a schedule released by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favorable for the exchange of information on the political relations between the two nations", the South American country's leadership said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderon's support for Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked a protest from Uruguay and the recall of his ambassador to the European country for consultations.
Mexico has been the chairman since November of the G20, a group made up of the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, an agreement with the South American country since January of this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange agreements to get off the OECD's "gray list" of countries that do not use international tax cooperation standards.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The mustachioed plumber will be 3D with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil clutches, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will hit stores worldwide this month, was designed with the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console in mind, which allows for three-dimensional play without the need for glasses.
"Mario is the hero who should tell how the stereoscopy will work without glasses", said Nintendo's head of press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the game's presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land is "Nintendo's first video game specifically designed for this platform", because to date successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D have been adaptations of existing games.
A Nintendo spokesperson stated that despite being in 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is an "affordable" video game that allows you to enjoy fast-paced and mobile play.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once they start, most experts will go "round two" to levels that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "not give in to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to a portable console, something that has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winked at fans of the series and repeated the successful formula from previous games, a mustachioed plumber must walk through dangerous minefields to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new moves, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as "playing" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States.
President Alvaro Colom said Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo has begun to hold him accountable in the United States for conspiring to launder $70 million.
This is the end of Guatemala's response to a request from a northern country to extradite Portillo to face trial there.
At a press conference, Kolom said his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and executive, taking into account that the first instance court had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had "not put his hands on" legal decisions and had taken all extradition procedures he ever knew of.
Along with Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom did shows the execution process after all legal and constitutional courts were exhausted to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and guarantees of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling Q120 million from the Department of Defense during his presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Department of Public Affairs appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of uneducated youth.
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organisation are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social isolation have been helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
Add to this the more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the closing ceremony, held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 near Trinitate Vella to help young people with a lack of education, unemployment and drug problems or who are vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have been cooperating with the association for 25 years.
The different political representation during the election showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the Chairman of the Generalitat, Arthur Massa, and his predecessor Hordi Pujol, the ceremony was attended by the former consultant of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and the ex-lieutenant mayor and current eco-socialist, municipal council member Ricardo Goma.
Fabra I Coats also has the current social welfare and family consultant, Josep Lewis Cleris, and La Caixa's social work CEO, Haume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove came into being at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting against bad circumstances and giving hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and the work done on it", he said.
The building that was used for the mass party has been evacuated.
The invaders have occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building at 51 Balmes Street.
12 occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without a fight .
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living at 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied yesterday at noon, where they were throwing a mass party that annoyed the neighbors, by court order without police intervention.
When the operation was over, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence.
"From now on, there will be a security check", the manager said.
Squatters who occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest were inhabited, took all the electricity and some of the water, painted the walls and left traces of all kinds, especially cans of alcohol.
The first three floors were a venue for mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Just behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her income had fallen by 80% since the building was occupied.
The owner of the club says that the squatters have drawn her into an unfair competition, as they sell drinks for three euros, while the club sells for 10.
In addition, the owner of the disco had to respond to neighbors' complaints about noise, although she noted that the noise was not caused by the club's visitors but by the squatters and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were held there, the frequency and intensity of which, according to the angry neighbors, had increased.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months he has been "forgiving" her rent.
The city police also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, councillor Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to address the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have arisen in the neighbourhood and the degradation in the area".
The popular leader explained that until the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters have invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them have been broken into.
In this sense, he added, "we must end impunity and stand firm against the culture of the building".
So, yesterday, the police evacuated a building in New Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police went to 35 Rue Montréal after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree to a bidding war after the bidding war
The 16 door competition has renewed debate over the role of the Colserol in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the now defunct Barcelona Capital Corporation (BCC), this administration printed promotional flyers for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital city of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a picture comparison to New York's Central Park.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park once again took its place in the minds of many as the high point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is oriented not north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Colserola as a nature park contradicts this idea.
The prototype wasn't Central Park, it was Yellowstone, with a wild boar as Yogi the Bear.
That was until, in September, the council announced a huge competition of 16 contests for a host of other gates in Colserol.
Under the gate is the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the goal on the field.
The question is, is it a park or a mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational aspect, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all Barcelona architects.
This is probably the most common theme discussed when two members of this clan of chosen people get to know each other in an elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects in Barcelona say and the scientists who were there.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldán, once the coastline is reached, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when the proposal of the Ildefon Serda, the mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"You have to assume that the biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, because of its excellent accessibility.
The Colserola is more complex", says the architect, for whom the title "Colserola Gate" contains a "verbal trap": we should not think of them "as entrances to a park, but as limitations of certain areas where we have to act".
Modolo, like Roldán and Bayonne, who have experience in urban planning, called the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of predicting public space" after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the Forum site "with its swan song".
The first fear is actually the limitation of where you can build.
"Limiting something is preparing for the next step", he means, the transition.
"We have to think about new urban planning tools because the current ones [regarding the General Capital Plan (GCP) ] can lead to real trouble".
Closer to the point, Modolo believes that simplifying the Colserola valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work being done outside Kalserola that "should not be overlooked", although he is grateful for the opportunity the city offers his profession to get involved in the project "from the beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should guide the interdisciplinary teams ("success", he argues) that were to create: "Architects should only be a tool".
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that sets the title of this section is difficult, as the rules of the competition lack a general view of the Colserola: "There were 16 intersecting competitions announced", he says, "in the sense of sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading here to see and understand the area as a whole".
That makes him, at least in his case, decide to enter 16 contests.
On the other hand, a design for a single gate may overlap with the architect's design for adjacent gates.
From your point of view, the council must ensure that the strip directly above the Ronde de Delta provides a fully equipped area to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larracebal and he will be released .
After 72 days of settlement, the Red Casino court granted a pardon to the mayor's brother in a lawsuit against him for extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be released after Red Casino's legal representative granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is prosecuting the extortion case against the mayor's brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos alleging that Manuel Jonas demanded that he pay an economic contribution to allow the Monterrey authorities to operate the casino secretly.
After public condemnation, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2 he was arrested and jailed for 30 days.
After four hours in front of a State Department agent on inheritance crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed there for 49 days, following the second travel ban order after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Kadereita for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a medium-security prison because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving his sentence in the municipal prison of San Nicolás in Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation, there was enough evidence to prove Jonas' guilt, such as the 1.5 million pesos he charged bookmakers in exchange for the operation's approval.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before Judge Jose Luis Pesina to ask for clemency for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the next few hours.
During the trial, the state prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he had paid the damages and which of the gambling house's partners was granting the pardon, although the lawyer tried not to name him.
Based on the 197/2011 record, Jonas Larrazabahl has been granted a legal pardon, and no further statements can be made about the trial that was planned against him; nor will any compensation or punishment be required.
After a hearing with the bookie's legal representative, at almost 3:50 p.m., it was ordered to release Larrazabault Breton immediately.
The court clerk, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He'll also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionisio Perez-Hacome gives details of the disaster that killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MOTC) said the results of the accident, which killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven others, showed that the helicopter hit the ground in perfect health without the pilot attempting an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Hakome, the Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft took off, the pilot had checked that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"Elements that appear to indicate that the ship had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with trees 25 meters away, where the vehicle lost its fuselage".
He also said that the ship was intended for 19 people, and therefore met the necessary requirements for transporting people.
He also said that the tests conducted at the impact site did not report the presence of any parts on the ground.
"The investigation reports that there are no components elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was designed to carry 19 passengers, which satisfied the requirements of the passenger transportation.
The earth's tilt at this point is between seven and 30 degrees.
At this point, the secretary said, the key is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study could take months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director general of Airports and Emergency Services, said the presidential helicopter was cruising at the time of the strike and that it happened on soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal flight maneuver at the time of impact", he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Perez Hakome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports indicated that the aircraft was heading for the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where layers of clouds were visible at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the team was looking for a lower altitude and higher visibility area in the Cuernavaca Valley because of the cloudy conditions.
The impact site.
The coordinates of the impact and the last radar record of the aircraft match, probably without loss of control or change of direction before the impact.
The scattered debris on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and the side lines.
The scattered debris indicates that the helicopter struck the ground in structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were detected:
There's no evidence of a shipwreck in the crash site, no evidence of an explosion or fire.
Recent studies suggest that there may have been multiple earthquakes.
During the site work, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground inclined from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple collisions with the ground.
After a thorough examination of a larger area than the designated area near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces a program to find the gene for obesity
Social protection is leading the research to find the gene for obesity in children and young people, supported by IPN experts
The Mexican Social Security Institute (MSSI) announced that it is conducting a study to identify the gene for obesity in children and young adults, called the "Genetics of Childhood and Adolescent Obesity" protocol, which will provide a count of signs associated with being overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Biochemistry Division of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the XXI Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is assisted by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI) Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV).
The population (registered or not) is invited to participate by visiting the participating MSSI sports centers in the Valley of Mexico, where children will be tested every Saturday morning at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol was started at the sports center in Cuauhtémoc (in the west of Mexico City), and since October 8 the events are being held at the sports center in Nesahualcóatl (in the east of Mexico City).
Once the goal of 500 to 600 children has been reached, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (south of Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to determine the risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
World Diabetes Day is being observed on November 14 and the main goal is to get 3,000 children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years old to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires with their parents' permission and supervision.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that can lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements (weight, height and waist circumference), blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are linked to childhood obesity) will be performed on all participants.
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects health care professionals' concerns about alarming weight gain in children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 show that in just six years, there was an increase: 77 percent of boys were obese, 47 percent of girls were obese, and there was a significant increase in overweight", said MSSI.
He said the rationale for the search for markers was based on the fact that the population of the country is different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican is 65 percent of American Indian descent, 30 percent of European descent, and five percent of African descent, and this condition has been linked to genes that are linked to diabetes and obesity.
He explained that the main cause of obesity is that the body is unable to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and it is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit to participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children, which can reveal whether they are overweight or obese to any degree.
Even, he said, dark folds on the neck and forearms indicate a risk of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with utmost confidentiality, and the doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are then told all the measures and lifestyle changes that they need to make to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home watching TV, and using transportation for short distances instead of walking.
It's also due to high calorie intake, which is the increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition, which is analyzed in this program.
The asphalt of UNAM will be able to avoid cracks
Raphael Herrera, a chemistry researcher at UNAM, developed polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the highest quality, resistant to environmental and temperature influences.
If the signals from road surfaces were taken into account, about 200,000 pits would need to be repaired each rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Herrera Najera, a chemistry researcher at UNAM, adding that if the construction and maintenance of paved roads are done correctly, the number of pits could be reduced or eliminated.
In his lecture Technological View of Pits, read as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Najera said this type of modified bitumen could be used in areas where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and thus prevent pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight called asphaltene, and others of low molecular weight called maltene, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscous behavior.
The viscous behavior of bitumen is that at high temperatures around 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 it is very viscous, and at 50 degrees Celsius it remains almost solid, while at very low temperatures bitumen becomes brittle, he said.
This means that the resistance of the asphalt is not constant but varies throughout the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
The chemfake scientist noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with flexible coatings, which are made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the topmost layers is bitumen, made up of small stones that are lowered into the bitumen and then pressed.
Every rock that makes up this coating, he said, is buried in bitumen.
When vehicles are moving and applying effort, it helps the forces to be very well distributed on the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be even more distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt, he added, is the last layer, called the wear layer, which is made of fine stone, actually sand also submerged in the asphalt.
Since this is a layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle, it must have greater resistance than asphalt and provide friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these efforts, the wear layer also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the condition of the asphalt.
When the soil is wet, water gets into the cover and it's hard for it to get out, so it causes all the layers of the cover to soften and hence form pits.
When pits form, he said, the wear layer first wears off and only then does it affect the bitumen, but the damage doesn't happen instantly, it's a process that should be addressed at the first sign of ongoing repair programs.
The National System of Researchers member also explained that transportation load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating must always be related to the transportation load and this requirement must be guaranteed to be met to prevent frequent pit formation.
Raphael Herrera said that there is still much to learn about bitumen, such as bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even help repair pits easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What did the Valea candidate miss to become the next Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from winning the Miss Colombia crown.
The representative of the Valleys has been crowned Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca is left with the only hope of winning the Miss Colombia crown.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content to take the podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were declared princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domínguez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Hisa Alvarez (2000), Catalina Alvarez (2007), and Jose Alfonso (2008).
The question that many people are asking now is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each of her performances has shown that she has everything to become the next Miss Colombia, not just because she was chosen by the Queen's Police and the Most Beautiful Face by Vogue - titles that have been held by queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who have been crowned Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she could not convincingly answer the question "What book characterizes you and why?", asked by Martin Murillo Gomez of the literary society Let's Read.
She said to the man who asked her,
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of occultisation, and I definitely think the book that characterizes my childhood  The Little Prince is a pretty deep book.
Today I'm reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read, and I'm also reading Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called Blood Fever.
An answer that the jury didn't like because of the term "culturation" and, second, because it didn't explain specifically how each of the books cited characterized it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with her result: "The universe is wise, what should happen happens".
And you all, please read a little, "The Little Prince is a great book".
Among the hypotheses put forward,  Vallee was burned out by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that, as she was preferred, she was met with applause, and she was the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Ostera's culinary competition, the audience vote for the best national costume, and the Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, provoked stress in the queen, and as a result she did not shine on stage".
And this was celebrated during her first appearance in a bathing suit at Hilton Beach and during her two appearances at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, she was noticeably lacking the strength and energy that Magdalena and Atlantica had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for RCN's "Like at Home" program, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not become queen".
Also, Representative Vallee has been avoiding the press lately, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Ms. Vallee failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That's why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look beyond appearance and focus on public awareness, before they enter the pageant, they should already be involved in the projects", she said.
There is also speculation that Ms. Vallee had a belly button defect and fibrosis that was visible on her abdomen, but this is disputed as the jury singled her out as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Her physique was not the best, or better, "but the fibrosis problems in her abdomen, which I didn't see, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day", says Jorge Hernán Orozco, a consultant to the kings.
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of the magazine Kromos believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she underwent surgery.
"The surgeries are good, but Representative Vallee doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset, and here she was being punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the cruel prediction came true last night, it is said that it was a necklace that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for her not having the pleasure of receiving the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that today Melina begins a year of reign, not as queen, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions directly specified by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena pageant, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
The forensic scientist from Cali made history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI forensic scientist Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC leader Alfonso Cano by matching his fingerprints.
Of the seven forensic scientists working at CTI, this week's watch was taken by Eleazar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has spent 21 years in the field of forensic investigation.
Early in his career, González worked in Choco towns, where he often had to travel for more than five days through the jungle to reach the location of the bodies that needed to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the Valleys and after completing the relevant courses he became a specialist in criminology, where he studied the friction of the skin, i.e. palms and stones.
During the week of Eleazar's operation to identify the man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something big was coming.
He arrived on a helicopter from Caucus to Palmyra Friday night.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who had led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Science (his real name).
However, when he arrived with his research team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and significantly thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using a magnifying glass, ink, a shovel, and a flashlight, Eleazar matched the body's fingerprints to those found in the photos.
His eyes were not deceived: it was Alfonso Cano.
That night, a representative of Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm to Secretary of Defense Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the RPCC.
Fingerprints are coming up .
For a specialist in the field of fingerprinting of the Sijin unit in Cali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos by Eleazar González at a press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Dental surgery is a rigorous science, no mistakes, and it can be a key tool in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, fingerprint specialists are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and identify detainees.
When arrested, many criminals have fake IDs or no papers.
We're gonna pull their prints and run them through the database.
The investigator said that in the case of theft, he had to take a piece of the wall of the house because the thief leaned his hands on it to grab a safe full of jewels and money.
"Walls are hard to work with because they are not a comfortable surface to take fingerprints on, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire palm and identify the criminal who was involved in several thefts", he says.
Prints also help rule out or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A man was recently found dead with liquor bottles around him.
The investigation revealed that a relative may have been involved in the crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle did indeed match.
While that doesn't guarantee he was the killer, it does prove he was at the scene.
A fingerprint specialist at CTI explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to the fingerprint sites.
When they appear, a spatula or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the fingerprint images are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the registry.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians", the CTI expert said.
He explained that it wasn't like CSI.
Just like not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch leaves a mark on you.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
Angry People is challenging the New York City government.
Hundreds of protesters have set up camp outside Zuccotti Square.
Some protesters heard the court ruling to disband the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
The Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York City authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to go thanks to a court order that allowed "angry people" to camp in the square while another part of the movement responded by seizing a park in the north of the city where further arrests were made.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the square, we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal fight to get back to Zuccotti and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations", said Mark Bray, a representative of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of "angry people" to the tent city evacuation order, which was personally given by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a ruling prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing the protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "angry men" have begun seizing a new park at the intersection of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the Trinity Church parish hall.
They could have occupied the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not give an exact number, but told Efe that he saw several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization says several hundred people had pitched tents at the site where a delegation of religious leaders had gone to show support for the movement's members, trying to mediate negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to consider the legality of this morning's crackdown.
Some of the protesters who went there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time and even gave those copies to the police guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes", said Bray, who said some police beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and enforcing "laws that were issued after the seizure began, or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops and other property that they used before".
Bloomberg told reporters that the city suspended public space because of the court order and that protesters had been informed, but local laws prevented them from opening tent shops and sleeping bags again.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the early morning removal of protesters from Zuccotti Square, an operation that resulted in about 200 arrests, and the decision was made because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the plaza cleared because it was becoming "a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses received threats" and neighbors feared "the deterioration of the quality of life".
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers", added a spokesman for the movement, who condemned the mayor for "disrespecting freedom of speech".
The Occupy Wall Street officials also indicated that they intend to hold "big rallies" on Thursday in partnership with civil society and unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson is going to be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special .
She will appear with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians in the television program "Russell Peters' Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in The Big Repair, a lifeguard in The Saviors of Malibu, Bunny in Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private broadcaster CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on Russell Peters' Christmas TV show on December 1st, playing a very special Mary.
CTV today released footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widely circulated home pornographic video featuring her with her then-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll depicting Jesus in a manger.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently appeared as the host of Charlie Sheen's My Cruel Torpedo of Truth tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luciana Lopilato in Buenos Aires in late March and is also a scandal-minded person.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a bitch during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan, rebuilding from the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% on domestic consumption, ending a slump that began in March.
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the rising sun country has suffered since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the damage at $300 billion - a blow that seems to be wearing off despite the dire world situation.
After three consecutive loss-making quarters, the July-September GDP figures definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% year-on-year.
The second quarter, which for the Japanese financial year starts in March 2012, also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The revival can be partly explained by the revival of buying machinery to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 percent versus a 0.9 percent decline in capital expenditures from January to March, the first decline after six months of steady growth.
But the true breakthrough in Japan's economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse to use the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, largely due to the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This figure increased by 1% as the cost of cars, travel and leisure increased.
The yen mark
Tokyo has given the domestic market a privilege that is squeezing like a rock on the exporters' accounts as the yen, the Japanese currency, has become one of the "refuge currencies" chosen by investors seeking to escape the eurozone debt crisis and negative forecasts for the US.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of big tech companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for their low performance from July to September.
As markets continue to siege the periphery of the EU, the government of Node is not letting up on its vigilance.
We must be vigilant about persistent risks such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, Economic Policy Minister Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And the prospects are not very bright.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most member countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts a global economic reversal has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average value of 100 points after it plummeted eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is once again giving rise to doubt .
Papademos said the amendment would be approved, but the Tories won't sign any written commitment.
With peripheral risk premiums and uncertainty reigning in the parks, Greece continues to wander the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "agreement" of the new transitional government of Ellada is being imposed by Brussels' demands rather than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon when he was appointed may not be enough to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, insists that he will not support new austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for February 19.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papademos said yesterday, opening the parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
The package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything".
The Conservative leader has taken a step further in his sentiment towards the EU and the IMF, the institutions that must unfreeze the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of agreement to the treaty's requirements.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of Papandreou's all-or-nothing referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are clear: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece's main parties sign "a written agreement without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Amadeo Altafay, a spokesman for the Economy Ministry, said the troika inspectors could return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although no exact date has yet been set.
The Greek knot will hold the thread for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen has stressed Spain's "core" position in this type of finance
Spain "has become a world leader in microfinance".
Queen Sofia reminded yesterday that over the past two decades the country has become the second largest donor of cooperation instruments, whose "essence", she said, is that it is "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on faith in people".
The Queen opened the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such actions are "completely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially with the aim of halving the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, the level at which the "poverty line" is set.
Spain is "still working" to expand its network of lenders worldwide and is taking this task with "responsibility", says Doña Sofia, hoping that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans".
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit is becoming not only a forum for debate but also a platform that promotes "two main goals".
So Her Majesty explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and 100 million of these households will be lifted out of the poverty they are in.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world "follows the path started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofia stressed, as an "act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of the instrument as "an astonishing idealist in the global fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policies on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continuous development everywhere", said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project earned her the title of "head of the family" yesterday, gathered in Valladolid by the "Banker of the Poor".
Finally, Queen Sophia concluded her speech by urging the audience to engage in discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"The ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said solidarity is an "ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries with boom times, as it is a "permanent commitment".
Jimenez concluded that microcredit entails "a serious and firm course to eradicate poverty", and that now "more than ever" developed countries' governments must work on the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main areas of development cooperation".
Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the "success" in giving "confidence" to the "disadvantaged, to whom all doors are closed", and Valladolid Mayor Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city, which "opens its doors embraced by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European Commission president by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress in Leipzig on Monday 14 November was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chair of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but it emerged in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the government's policy is far from as strict as it should be, today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with regard to Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, put to the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted for several minutes and was won by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, a Euro-phile and finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "it is time for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that would allow the European Union to have greater control over the financial policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also affect the election of the European Commission president by universal suffrage "to give Europe a face".
At any rate, this is one of the proposals in the draft resolution passed by the Congress, which is obviously the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that 27 countries will quickly agree to this decision; Britain is against it, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against it too.
But the ground is ready.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member state on the European Central Bank board according to the size of each country's economy, which would have significantly increased the weight of the German economy.
To calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased her references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty who like to criticize "haughty" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe has a whole paragraph on the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing through.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is a medical record fraud?
Following the cash benefits, the UMP and the government launched an offensive on the hospital beds.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family allowance fund and deliver a speech on the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, about combating social benefits fraud.
And to help this offensive, which is born out of a desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right's re-election campaign, most want to focus on the hospital beds.
In order to save money, the government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies before the start of benefits.
Obviously, without the employer's specific consent, a sick worker will lose four days' wages, at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to create a storm of anger but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And that will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose a one-day sickness benefit on public employees (public employees have not had to wait for benefits until now, unlike the three-day wait for private sector employees).
Now, when these issues are discussed, most also bring up the subject of fraud again, referring to abuse of medical records.
Control will be tightened and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you have received illegally", warned Xavier Bertrand on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the claim was somewhat out of proportion to the actual abuse of hospital records.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subjected to constant scrutiny and political attacks that have borne fruit.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the numbers by country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs of €11.3 trillion in 2008 accounted for 5% of total healthcare expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% was for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sickness benefits, amounting to EUR 6.2 billion.
And therefore, it was 2.5% of healthcare costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The average is arithmetic, which hides some of the discrepancies; another study published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had never taken a single day off from work.
Another study, this time on health insurance, claims that in 2010 37% of people were in hospital for less than 8 days, 15% for 15 days to one month, 15% for one to three months and 11% for longer.
If you compare these figures with those of their European neighbours, you see that French workers are no more likely to take sick leave than workers in any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the total rate of absence from work in France (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud rate for hospital records is very low compared to the gray jobs.
As far as the fraud rate is concerned, it's very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 led to systematic checks of hospital patients lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million cases examined, CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 conclusions about short-term illness were "unwarranted" or "too long", making 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital records for more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", or 132,000.
In total, 169,000 cases were "unfounded" for the several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, say, the gray employment figures.
According to UMP MP Dominic Thian, author of a report on the issue in June, they amount to between 9 and 15 billion euros of unreceived budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation and is therefore infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papademos: Greece must follow new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
This was stated in parliament on Monday, November 14, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition government were not enough to accomplish this task.
"To achieve the goal of rescuing the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme", said the prime minister, who made his first public statement opening a debate on a vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the Eurozone is "put on the map", he added.
Accordingly, Papademos predicts a reduction in the country's budget deficit "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, from 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new government's measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said at a meeting with lawmakers from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the goals of reducing deficits and debts and combating overspending, but also his rejection of any course that would impede the recovery of the economy.
To Olli René, the European Commissioner in charge of economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 trillion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians are denied the right to die, says a report from the Royal Society of Canada
Regarding palliative medicine, the committee says that government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and that is not counting cancer.
Canadians are denied the right to die.
Only 9% of Canadians would tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The committee is proposing that the government amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when the choice is made under the circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin, experts cite a recent study by the Bureau of Economic Analysis that compared the quality of death in 40 countries.
Although Canada is in 10th place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to discuss death".
Medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, say experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse of the practice, i.e. euthanasia or assisted suicide in people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized, confirmed Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report during a teleconference.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it's obviously illegal.
Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It's important to remember that 85% of Canadians support euthanasia because, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll, they believe it will allow people to alleviate their suffering at the end of life.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for people who have assisted suicide, 41 percent of those surveyed believe they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear-cut when it comes to extending or ending medical care, say the authors.
They also suggest, among other recommendations, that the penal code should establish that legally legitimate termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained respectfully to refuse medical care at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
On palliative care, the committee urges government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best palliative care possible, and not just for cancer.
Finally, with respect to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Committee requires that it be used when it is not intended to relieve physical pain, as in euthanasia, and subject to the same restrictions.
Comments from other experts
Some health law experts have already commented on the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's report.
Mayor Pierre Deschan, a health law expert, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme" because, among other things, it does not limit euthanasia to fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 can ask for help in committing suicide, said Mayor Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mayor Descham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place individual independence above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society".
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expresses "a strong disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called a 'manifesto for euthanasia.'
Margaret Somerville, herself a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, has challenged the report's findings, in particular, regarding abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to cede power
Damascus condemns "conspiracy" by the Syrian government
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's supporters held a demonstration yesterday outside the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria increased for Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia's support, is resisting him and condemning a "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after Syria's membership in the Arab League was suspended, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria's neighbors Turkey and Jordan called for President Assad's resignation.
Jordan's King Abdullah II yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria, where about 40 more civilians and regime military personnel have been killed.
"If Bashar cared about his country's interests, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life", the king of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu expressed regret that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, have not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot meet their aspirations will lose power, he said, alluding to Syria, a neighboring country that Turkey is increasingly taking a hard line against.
For its part, the United States welcomes "the expansion of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League and countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly tough line on the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department official.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's armed forces have been killed in the Derra area in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reported.
Two other residents were killed in a shootout and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country was nearing the end of the crisis".
He also sharply reacted to the Arab League's decision to exclude Damascus, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this conspiracy against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the Arab League is currently studying "the mechanism for protecting civilians and demanding the entry into the country of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also spoke in favour of sending UN monitors to help protect civilians from repression by a regime he said had fallen into "paranoia".
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis resolution plan adopted on November 2 that includes the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities where the fighting is taking place and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy , please .
Monty demands time from the markets and casualties from the Italians.
Italy's incoming prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to put together his team and implement a program that will require "sacrifices" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in a discussion with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He would have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats who are not in parliament.
Monti spoke of the importance of a program that involves many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting with the prime minister candidate.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote on a confidence vote by Friday to make sure the new government had enough support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monti presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of the stock exchanges and bondholders by asking for time.
"In a democracy, it takes time to prepare the government and the programme", he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concern has re-emerged, particularly after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The new prime minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence from parliament on Friday.
Mr Monti has guaranteed that, once he takes office, he will work hard to ensure that Italy becomes an important player in Europe again.
The European Commission's spokesman, Olli Rehn, stressed that "despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed".
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not meet its 2013 budget despite a austerity plan adopted in recent months, has demanded, in particular, new austerity measures.
Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marchegalia, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy "because a country that does not have growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconiism", a "professor" who symbolizes "a challenge to seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the authors of the forewords.
The big unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid early elections, as Italy must make payments on its 200 billion euro public debt by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran 's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko has been helping Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, an American agency specializing in nuclear hazards confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to establish the scientist's identity.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the "possible military aspect" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "starting in the sixties, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds for explosive methods".
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to create a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
The IAEA report cites "clear indications that Iran's development" of nuclear detonators "has been facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only has a good knowledge of the technology but who has also told the agency that he has spent most of his career working on the technology as part of his home country's military nuclear program".
Anti-Muslim crime increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, between 2009 and 2010, anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 percent, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or remained unchanged over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in attacks on Jews and a 14% overall increase in religious-based crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that the number of such crimes is rising again, Human Rights First stresses, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant", the organization adds in an official statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, like all forms of hate crimes, should be treated as serious human rights violations", added Paul Legendre, one of the group's executives.
"The U.S. government can and should do more to address these crimes", he adds, believing it can be done by improving police reporting on hate crimes".
Hate crimes in federal law are a legacy of the civil rights era.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence based on race, color, religion, nationality and, more recently, sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform to look like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to the presentation of its platform that will allow its users to see the activity of those they follow, making the service similar to Facebook.
The new activity tab and new name make it easier and more direct to track the activity of other Twitter users, the users whose posts you follow and those who follow yours.
It gives you a way to see if they're posting, if they're signing up for new accounts, if they're getting selected messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Caroline Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known for being intuitively confusing and using rather vague terms (RT for posting someone else's seduction, #followfriday for recommending following other users), is mainly pleasing to experienced users, opening itself up to a wider audience by introducing users to something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
Users discussed the innovation via "tweets" on the Internet.
"It's useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook".
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed, @dannykronstrom wrote.
Austria
The introduction of the "golden rule" of the budget into the constitution
The leadership of the grand coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's state credit rating (triple A) by rating agencies.
The Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Feymann personally announced the decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, despite the fact that Austria's public debt is 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's solvency had fallen by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year, argued Christian Democrat Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindellegger.
Austria is thus fulfilling the demand of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels, where the heads of state and government demanded that budget deficits be reduced by the end of 2012 and that balanced public accounts be restored through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decision by the Austrian government is reminiscent of the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced every year by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the lands, like the communes, should present balanced budgets.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% mark set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
I 'm not going to tell you .
threatens a new intervention in the currency market
Japanese Prime Minister Yashihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene in the currency market if the yen continued to rise.
We will intervene as we did last time if we find excessive volatility in the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to near historic levels, prompting the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a massive scale to devalue the Japanese currency, which had set a new record for strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has been rising steadily, driven by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these troubled times of global economic downturn and the European debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is hurting Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the amount of income Japanese firms earn from abroad when converting into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, stressed Mr. Noda, who fears the yen's rise will kill the fragile seed of recovery.
The world's third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5% year-on-year for the first time, driven by rising exports and consumption by disaster-hit households.
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect "Japan's fundamental economic indicators".
Finance Minister Jun Azuumi urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps", making it clear that no further easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuer increased its purchase of Treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47 thousand million euros), raising to 55,000 thousand million yen (519 thousand million euros) the ceiling of the amounts it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
The Eurozone
The stock market is up, the stock market is down.
The risk of a debt crisis is undermining European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in volatile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European stock markets went into a slightly negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4 percent and closed trading at 3,064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt fell 0.4%, and the London one fell 0.1%.
With the euro area countries in difficulty again struggling to repay their loans, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent gains.
"Concerned investors are simply too concerned about the risk of infection", explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock market closed down 0.7% amid renewed doubts about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its gaze to Europe, and the stock exchanges will follow one another in a narrow corridor of change until investors have proof that the situation has stabilized", says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of anxiety about the future of the eurozone is hitting the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party congress on Monday, which passed a resolution that included a possibility for a struggling country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher at 6% .
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at alarming levels.
This morning, on Tuesday, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield on Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These interest rate difficulties in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel fears among participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the stock exchange for time to restore the situation in Italy, which is in danger of being paralyzed by the weight of its debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain was under a barrage of markets ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections.
The spread between the interest rates on 10-year German and Spanish debt obligations has reached a new historic high.
Waiting for growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised downward the second quarter figures, with a fall of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma .
If there is one issue that cannot be decided after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election rallies become a reason to reflect on the role and place of nuclear power.
The debate will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed are examined.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
Now, with seven billion people on the planet, the demographic growth will double the electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world's population is deprived of essential elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to address the growing shortage of fossil fuels to continue to generate electricity on a permanent basis, while also keeping in mind the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate imbalance, a topic that has largely disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident doesn't change any of those factors.
That's why Germany is alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is making its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or in Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil - these are just a few of the countries that are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one more to its fleet, resuming construction of the station, which had been interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
Although Germany's renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, the reality is contrary to this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in increased electricity costs, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark is worth considering.
Europe's champion in turbine construction, which generates 30% of its electricity, it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas because of intermittent wind; which makes carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to our consistent energy policies, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
In a globalised economy, energy prices are a key factor in competitiveness and the maintenance of industrial equipment in the country, so French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a huge increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory the beautiful claims of the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
A price most French people refuse to pay, especially since they have no objection to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole host of small and medium-sized enterprises specialising in international trade and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France were to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6 billion euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What kind of electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to last 60 years if the manufacturer was going to shut down?
To solve the energy equation, we must recognize that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy.
Areva's development of low-carbon solutions, both nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy , maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly vital .
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres such as Flamandville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is widely recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
In the last 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental impact.
In Chernobyl, the reactor's design and unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
Some people in Fukushima seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that killed tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the two before it.
The result of this step and the cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that will help to combat such phenomena.
Since it is being considered by all energy professionals who want to build a reactor, stopping its construction in Flamandville would be a great gift to Areva's and EDF's competitors, paving the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial position of our country.
Immigration - A Burden or a Benefit for the Economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticized from all sides - overloading police, judicial and administrative services with a policy of numbers and its compatibility with France's self-proclaimed status as a "human rights state".
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which made headlines when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters".
But it's rarely analyzed from an economic standpoint.
The right and the left are largely in agreement on this issue.
On the right, Jacques Chirac declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed would not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", while on the left, Michel Rocard explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from all over the world".
The only difference is the level of generosity .
In 2005, the fear of an invasion of the territory of the Polish waterworks horde was felt by both the left and the right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the level of generosity they're willing to show to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confined himself to the mundane, saying that "working together will solve our immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can be an electoral advantage, but economically it is very costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in their recent book summarizing the latest data on immigration (People of Interest: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), there is broad consensus among scholars about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that host immigrants.
Restricting immigration leads to slower growth and lower employment.
Fears of immigrant influence are based on the notion that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled ones, by causing lower wages.
But experience shows that in reality, immigrants are more likely to supplement than replace the local workforce, doing jobs for which there is a shortage of local labor.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, while the most skilled work in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between locals and immigrants means that the influx of immigrants has a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And that's without considering the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring to the table is driving innovation and economic growth (among American Nobel laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute a net benefit to social security systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, for example, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring an average of 150,000 euros of net income (income minus expenses) to the state budget in his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy was about to grab the missing growth points with his teeth at the beginning of his term.
The teeth they used to scare off immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we have to understand European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable asset, but it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens over two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it has survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to arrange voting and make it as direct as possible.
It's been known since the days of Napoleon the Little that this comes from superficial thinking.
Universal voting, while a necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and may even become "an instrument of repression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vashor once said.
No, democracy requires much more than that - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first and foremost it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palinody of the truth-false Greek referendum will have a double exposure effect, demonstrating both the need for a major policy change and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality must be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the fight for democracy has now shifted and, according to many, the Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will gain nothing by demanding a series of national referendums, organised as needed and in a chaotic order.
A carte blanche for an absolute European monarch or a bound-foot leap into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine, but of the implementation of a common, clear and continuous choice and democracy, this time at a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more we will have to list, because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
Europe as a whole is under the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its own weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but Europe as a whole is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to return the governance of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce the burden of debt on everyone, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The way out of the crisis will require European-wide solutions, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now demands a European economic government.
Let's just do it like that.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has been achieved by the citizen is another madness and another deadlock.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
That lesson is still valid.
We must build a Europe united on an economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at a political level, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are becoming more common.
The World Chip Show opens Tuesday in Vilpente, near Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM-card phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 billion units.
The most important is the contactless technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transportation or shopping by simply holding the card over the reader.
This year, 460 million contactless cards will be sold worldwide, compared with 320 million last year!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected to be 580 million) and will account for almost 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France starts from a more modest position: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in circulation.
But the big stores are picking up the pace.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Passes this year.
To move to higher speeds, banks need to supply their customers with equipment.
"Two large organisations in France have pledged to systematically distribute contactless cards to their customers in the future", said Gerard Neboui, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments.
But this is only the first step in the development of the future payment method, which is the mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with the NFC technology needed to make such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they should really fly away next year".
"We expect global sales of between 80 and 120 million units in 2012", explains Mark Burton, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment to be held from December to June next year in Cannes.
Approximately 200 customers and employees' iPhones will be equipped with contactless payment cases.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that it was preparing to launch a market offering that would allow its customers to pay through mobile phones.
The terror front is spreading from the Sahara to Nigeria .
Paris is concerned about the Islamic Maghreb's ties to Boko Haram.
Long-standing links between the Al-Qaeda in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) terrorist group and the Boko Haram sect in Nigeria have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister Abdelkader Messaghel even said that Algerians now believe it.
"The way these two organizations are working and the intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating", he explained, without elaborating.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January revealed two connections.
Abducted from a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Lecourt and Vincent Delory were apparently killed the next day along with several of their captors in an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
The axis of terror
The analysis of the calls revealed several recipients in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
Two numbers are of particular interest to investigators, according to Radio France Internationale (RFI); one points to a Nigerian who has lived in Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram, a city in northern Nigeria, for a long time, and another to a man allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must wait for more solid evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's actions and statements and in its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type used by Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now pressuring Abuja to address the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people who are of no interest.
It was a quick success.
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri with a mosque, school and imam-fundamentalist Muhammad Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Hausa means "Western education is a sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicised and demands strict adherence to Sharia law, and its activists have launched a struggle against the wicked central government.
It's targeting churches, bars and government agencies.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's response, as usual, has been uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, captured alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and expanding beyond its northern foothills.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram carried out the first suicide attack on a police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, a local UN mission will be their first international destination.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi entrenched in Mali and Niger and Somali al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The world as seen by the Republican presidential candidates
When it comes to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are all competing for simplicity and incompetence.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplified, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters might believe it.
For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been making loud but lackluster foreign policy statements that have traditionally been Republican strong points.
The slogans about China, Iran and helping Israel are often mixed up.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being nominated by the "Old Good Party", threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency - it's a sensitive subject for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
"Even worse if it leads to a trade war", he said.
John Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with an understanding of complex foreign policy, couldn't resist a position that indulges emotion.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who's at the bottom of the ratings, has gone unheard.
It 's Reagan style .
Romney also vowed military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I will stop Iran", he announced.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of not keeping his promises to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, second in the candidates' ranking, has shown a discouraging ignorance.
He recently called for confronting the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to build a nuclear power - apparently unaware that China has had one since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants military strikes on Iran, says he's willing to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture of terrorism suspects, which Obama banned in 2009, is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All of this is a far cry from 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The president's opponents say Reagan had simple ideas too and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama was an amateur himself and that he had to tone down his fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his ruses in Libya, which earned him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive is not so easy.
The population sees a positive balance of national security under Obama, who eliminated bin Laden.
After Iraq, it doesn't believe in military interventions that get stuck in the sand.
And when he says that America needs to be economically restructured to regain its leadership, Obama is right.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas to Europe.
The Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been launched.
It is designed to supply the equivalent of 30 million households with gas.
Gazprom, Russia's giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate with a bang.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic shores, between an orchestra performance and fine dining, in the opening of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte have all turned a symbolic valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new gas pipeline will bring 27,5 million cubic meters of additional gas to Western Europe each year through the first 1224 km pipeline connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomeranian.
The second pipeline should be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to all of France's gas consumption.
And the possibility of a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it harder to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not stop comparing the Nord Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means it's a politically sensitive issue.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has managed in less than five years to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries that consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
"This gas pipeline is part of our cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically connects us", said François Fillon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating the importance of large gas contracts both politically and economically.
This explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives who were present in large numbers at Lubmin, the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel, encased in concrete to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, we had to bypass the minefields left over from World War II.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", said Jens Müller, a spokesman for the North Stream company.
Many steps were also needed to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake, weighing the weight of 242 Eiffel Towers, with no gaps along its entire length, no valves, and no service stations.
The control platform was planned to be built in the Swedish area, but the project managers refused it because Sweden was not happy that the Russian state company would settle permanently on its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we can cut off the gas flow in less than a minute", says Jens Müller.
So, in the event of a leak, the gas in the pipeline will be released into the air.
But that seems unlikely to the designers who designed the seams to only leak once every 100,000 years.
The gas pipeline will be monitored by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
The cigar-shaped device is inserted into a 1 meter diameter pipe and pushed forward by a gas stream.
When it arrives after three full days of travel at 10 feet per second, it gives precise information about any metal deformation.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest need for repair.
The gas circulates only at its pressure.
It's 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (each 15.5%), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (each 9.0%).
These five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was tasked with building and operating the pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Then Gazprom leased it to this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas is actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The gas pipeline was financed by 30% of the shareholders and 70% of the bank loans.
The total cost of the work will be 7.4 billion euros for the two pipelines.
GDF Suez will invest around 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will recoup their costs because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline runs from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to a sandy beach with coniferous trees.
The 15 foot high valves form the gas outlet terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before it is pumped into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full power, it's going to be 3 million an hour, and in 2012, it's going to be 6 million.
The Moleskine branded notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will bring back the taste of writing.
It has the smell of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its rectangular black cover, its rubber, its yellowish-white pages, which seem to have turned yellow with time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, has decided to launch designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's consultant at the time, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique, the moleskin - a lacquered cotton fabric used, for example, to cover benches.
It is said that this type of notebook is highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought to today's taste an old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century", said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% to 12.7 million units.
We've come a long way from the early years when we only produced 3,000 notebooks.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the USA.
It's hard to profile a typical buyer because the notebook is equally appealing to business people, students and freelancers.
Moleskine's customers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
A small Italian company that started with only 12 employees now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, in small towns and has gained wide recognition.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this new need for writing, despite the advent of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural trait has accompanied the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized an exhibition "The Circular Way", where architects and artists showcased their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched leopard art covers for the Locarno film festival.
Leveraging its success and cultural aura, Moleskine diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and all kinds of supports.
A success that was enviable: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for disabled people begins today.
Despite the public charity policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is still twice the average, at 19% compared to 9% for the general population.
Discouraged?
"No", says Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes Employment Week for the Disabled.
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not two times, but three times higher".
"But there is still much work to be done".
I must say that there are still many obstacles to employment for people with disabilities.
Among them , the elderly are more numerous: 37% are over 50 (an average of 17%).
They have rather low qualifications: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very high, at 85% for disabled people, compared with 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are the core of the problem", says Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about a mentality that's changing, but it's changing too slowly.
A study commissioned by the Cité by IMS-Entreprendre in April found that managers surveyed had low knowledge of disability and "imagined themselves as people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the target of 6% disabled workers set by the 1987 law.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6%.
"Today we are at about 3%", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes on companies that do not comply with the law.
Evidence: the number of 'taxable' organisations, as well as the amounts paid, fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59 000 to 46 000 organisations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law that raised the tax put a lot of pressure on companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects the rise in awareness, particularly in large enterprises".
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organisations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared with 82% of organisations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What a happiness"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday evening (20:45), Eden Azar and Georges Leekens made no secret of the pleasure they had gained from this friendly match.
We won't go so far as to say there was a conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the podium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after the stunt his striker pulled against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I'm very happy with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he's Belgian".
"I want to go further", assures the Lille player.
As for the contrast between his achievements at the club and in the national team, it is one whole, he justifies.
"I'm in Lille all year round, but not in Belgium".
"I have to earn points".
Left in reserve ahead of this match against France, in the game against Romania on Friday evening, Azar arrived in Saint-Denis to finally shine.
Not forgetting, however, the concept of "pleasure".
He has supported the Blues since he was 7 years old and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported them", he says.
That, of course, also reinforces the special nature of this match.
And especially that on the other side are Mathieu (Debussy), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We just crossed paths".
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens was kindly reminded of "pride".
"Pride" to play in the "Festival Match".
"Pride" also claims as a "neighbour" that France "has become a very high-level team again" just a year after the injury in Naizen.
"Laurent Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly on the same plane with the blue team... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing", he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll see that in future games, including this one against France".
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal's Paulo Bento starts his return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to it, both teams seemed to lose their sense of reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that the national team he has been leading since September 2010 will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to be played, and Bosnia to be won.
With Friday's 0-0 in Zenitsa's hell, it's clear the game isn't over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for over an hour, they failed to score the coveted goal that would have calmed them down.
"It's a good result, but it comes with a risk".
But at home, at their brightly lit Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident they will pass, in front of the crowd, which should be excited, although the match will be very tense", said the optimistic but sensible Bento.
"We expect a very intense match, but we are convinced that we can win", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of getting to Euro 2012", said Karlus Keirosh's successor.
A draw on Friday against Bosnia demands a win from the Portuguese.
A draw would have satisfied the Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but it comes with some risks", Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and a lot of individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenitsa, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not giving them time to think".
Good idea, if only it was realistic this time.
