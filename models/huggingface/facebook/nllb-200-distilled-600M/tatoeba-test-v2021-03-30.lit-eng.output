Beth always got what she wanted.
You didn't tell him anything?
Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen.
She knows exactly what she wants.
- I'm all right.
Did Tom forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, it's time to wake up.
The baby cried all night.
She didn't like living in the city.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do what you want.
The man you saw yesterday is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf in the rain.
What's this test?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because it's good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
The teacher teaches.
What do you see in him?
What do you see?
It's not what you think!
You can buy a dog at that shed.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same.
It's simple and intuitive.
How many hours a week do you work?
Yeah, two.
They're not helping.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.

Sooner or later, we're all going to die.
How long is this gonna take?
- It's a shadow.
Where is the German embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is wonderful.
But he knew it couldn't go on.
I guess not.
I want that, too!
She looks but sees nothing.
He can't eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel the world.
Do you like Italian?
I got five years in prison.
I didn't wake up.
Any universe that is simple enough to understand is too simple to create a mind that can understand it.
We didn't have to rush.
Please?
It doesn't matter which team wins the game.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go and get in your car.
Bring her a plate of salads.
We're at war.

Did you get the letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
You're the one who did it.
She rejected my request.
What do you prioritize?
I like Korean food.
I was invited to lunch.
You're still green.

We left the door open.
Can you come at nine?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't received his help, I would have been dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why are you here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom is still not here right now?
Millions of people lost their lives in the war.
Compare your sentence to that on the table.
She welcomed him with joy.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't know what's happening to me anymore.
I learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don't expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
You have to be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Shut the door.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Get back in your seat.
Be friendly.
Isn't that a wonderful morning?
It's a story, at least.
I'm getting more and more gray hair.

His son has eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
What time did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy one pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't go out now. We're getting ready for lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old man.
Eat the bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Tom does not speak English.

Tom has already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're the one who did it.
What are you doing in there?
What's that supposed to mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest.
What's that?
I study Japanese.
It's not worth it.
It had a woman's head, a lion's body, bird wings, and a serpent's tail.
Tell me how you solved that problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it doesn't, then let's go.
Who's coming with me?
I agree.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'm going to France on vacation.
You can sit wherever you want.
You're an engineer.
The door opened slowly.
It's a story, at least.
Do you play any sports?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about lives here.
Please just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you'll see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I was talking to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
I still remember the days when you and I made a breakthrough together.
When we go to bed, we say good night.
The scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he could not even buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know that I know.
Get home before 6:00.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles lit up the room.
I'm sorry about that.
Cut the paper in half.
What does he say in the letter?
The woman is eating bread.
I eat an apple.
A single person enjoys watching ants.
Who is that man sitting at the other table?
Are you pregnant?
I'm really tired now.
His steps were speeding up.
The eternal silence of these endless spaces scares me.
Why do you need a new scarf?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take off your hat when you get into class.
They're not doing anything else, they're just complaining.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me when you arrive in Boston.

This is ours.
I'm listening to the radio.
The kid wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How are you? - Good.
Your journey begins here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're going to have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new shed.
Everybody knows her.
She's incredibly naive.
Where in Turkey do you live?
Tom started.
I can't. I can't.
Get out of the classroom.
There are three dogs sleeping on my mother's ladder.
Tom has already finished the work he needed to do.
If you can't have children, you can always adopt.
That's what I was thinking.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still couldn't get on the bus.
They need friends.
- Hey, please.
Can you wrap it up as a gift?

What places did you visit on that tour?
It started raining so we played inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.

I'm like my mother.
You look just charming tonight.

You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom changed.
It's hot, so be careful not to burn.

That tree grows near her house.
Don't talk in the reading room.
How are you, miss?
I would have changed the yen to dollars.
I hate winter.
I think Tom is going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I was rich, I would have given you some money.
