Politicians in Wales fear "making fools"
There was panic among some members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (the Welsh Parliament).
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could lead to ridicule.
A Labour member said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with the Twp and the Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fiddle).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to introduce the name changes, said: 'The final decision on the appointments of members of Parliament is, of course, up to the members themselves.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, in which there was widespread support for the Assembly to be called the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the MPs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (Welsh MPs) or WMPs, but the MWP option was most supported in a public consultation.
The Member States seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the amendments within a few weeks.
The draft law on reforms contains other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final vote on what they will be called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has long protested Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposes the vote and says he will reject it.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's will be silent while the churches in Harlem struggle
"The older people I spoke to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today none of the parts are there".
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in different ways these days", he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people enter on a daily basis".
In relation to churches, he worries that the money raised from selling assets will not last long and that "sooner or later it will be back where it started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes filled with the kind of people who don't help the neighborhood's returning shelters.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings are white", he says, "and this adds to the trend where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into properties will become members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
A black congregation that had operated nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who was leading a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem that would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parish children made plans to restore the building, they ordered the clock tower.
Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, the Rev. David Johnson, proudly called the clockwork "the clock of the poor".
The expert who played the clock in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first clockwork played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clockwork at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's couldn't find a replacement for him.
What has been happening at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been recruited by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The parish council, the parish's governing body, which consists of leading lawyers, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concerns that the diocese would "try to push the expenses forward" to the parish council, even though the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese had sent in.
Some of the congregation members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishopric.
Shark injuries 13-year-old on a diving trip after lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the first day of lobster season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying out for help and then paddled over with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just excitement to catch a lobster, but then he realized the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"His whole collarbone was torn up", said Hammel, as he approached the boy.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported to be in critical condition.
It's unclear what kind of shark attacked.
Life-saving agent Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's is taking up the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to take over the UK beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and home goods fall, the larger beauty product lines are being tested in 11 stores across the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove to be successful.
The investment in beauty products is taking place as supermarkets look for new shelf products that were previously used for television, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's says it's doubling its beauty product line to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are being introduced for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will also be given more space with burnt areas in the style of those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching a range of boutique make-up, so that most products are suitable for vegans  something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop is testing stores in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the other in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small quantities of food daily from local shoppers mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes on the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since buying both chains two years ago, which have strengthened their grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to update its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint effort with Boots in the early '00s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how to distribute the profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store chain to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty product line to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs and the busy environment and convenient locations mean we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones "razzing", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million deal
Dragons star Peter Jones left "rabid" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-supply and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning hostess, 37, went on Instagram to announce she's leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons star Peter Jones furious after she withdraws from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "astonished" when the popular TV lady during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals  worth up to £1.5 million  meant she no longer had enough time for their home products and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly while Jones flew out of the UK for one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term project she was going to be working on for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale".
Experts estimate that the announcement by the UK's highest-earning This Morning host could cost the company several million dollars due to large investments in products  from pillows to candles to clothing and home products  and the potential for further delays in launch.
And it could also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and landlord Dan Baldwin has had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the board as chairman in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to be M&S' fire ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business activities".
♪ We had a hard talk ♪ ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He laughed at the criticism he would get from the news media for making a comment that "is not worthy of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news host.
"I gave up nothing".
He noted that Kim is interested in a further meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "compliant reaction" from the United States to North Korea's initial anti-disarmament efforts.
He noted that the United States would instead continue to impose sanctions aimed at keeping pressure running.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his election speech.
"It's going really well with North Korea", he said.
"There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship".
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results  completion of missile tests, aid in the release of hostages and the return of earthly remains from US military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to act state-like, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastate island and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population was homeless, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international emergency assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Emergency Response Unit, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very ill prepared for natural disasters.
There are tsunami shelters built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami warning is missing and this has likely affected the death toll.
Even under the best of conditions, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's poor infrastructure a focal point of his campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But Mr Jokos' administration has been plagued by a lack of funding as next year's election campaign progresses.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge draw at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind 1-0.
He kicked the ball with his left foot before firing a high shot at the furthest pole.
The ball flew high above the field toward the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position of catching the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think much about it, and I just took the shot".
Chelsea led 1-0 in the semi-final after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker handed his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he set his pace on the midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's halfway house.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran off the defense and ended up hitting the furthest pole with a shot with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster emergency service said early Sunday.
Many were reported to be trapped in the rubble from buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit on Friday, creating waves up to 6 metres high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered in debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old man was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who saw or heard anything to step forward.
Police Assistant Brian O'Hagan commented: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something with dashcam, to contact us, as they may have information that may be crucial to the investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are informing the victim's relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but he gets word from the police that no one is allowed in the building.
He was paralyzed when he heard what had happened.
The residents will now know that it will be several hours before they can enter again.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A weeping woman arrives.
She keeps saying, "It's so terrible".
At 2:00, there were two police cars inside the blockade and another car just outside.
A number of officers were standing within the blockade and monitoring the apartment complex.
Anyone with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and report log 247 on September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest monument to be hit by the debate on "rewrite of history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The image storm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas' actions in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more, in the late 19th century than he is today, to be a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate representation is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and memory".
A woodland grizzly attacks and kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a pulse poisoned and stabbed in blood near a pigsty market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigway next door was open.
He said there was a big hornet with blood in his mouth on the pig's path.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had bit the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My uncle's legs were bloody and injured", said the uncle, nicknamed "Wu", in a Guiyang Evening News quote.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuans family and authorities from the market are negotiating compensation for his death.
This is one of the rare cases, but there have been previous reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 200-pound pig beat a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playful.
Those nappies, they're very curious... they're not gonna hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in much of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will cause heavy rainfall with flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. on Sunday (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure outlet across the Pacific Ocean is forming, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will give up 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the nearest low pressure outlet, causing heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Local 25 to 101 mm of rain will cause dangerous storm surges, floating precipitation and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will produce up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of up to 51 to 101 mm is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, particularly over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high likelihood of stormy floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn the gorges into tidal rivers and thunder will create strong local winds and create dust storms.</seg>
The approaching low-pressure runway will cause heavy rain along the coastline in parts of Southern California.
There is a risk of over 13 mm of aggregate precipitation, which may result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Spread tropical rainfall will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and expand further late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, there may be a large temperature fluctuation throughout the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but it remains fairly warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern areas.</seg>
It could be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the audition for Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people on Thursday saw gripping testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political battle with the stations continued, interrupting regular programs to tell about Friday's late developments: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the defendants.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, was angry with her and tried to take off her clothes for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional statement that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it's likely 20.4 million people watched it on Friday.
The company reported average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate viewers from other stations that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a viewing number that's equivalent to a game in the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-driven hosts have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, topped all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught in front of open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the jury trial.
He was looking down for several minutes while being slammed and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator closed, he wanted to say more at the committee hearing.
All the stations went live a few hours later, when the judging committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should go on to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favor of the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, as the Democrats, who have a minority in the Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a number of senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, described his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous".
Shot on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The police department says a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the state police lab, Southern University police and local residents have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "care and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-8 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"It's the kind of thing you're always afraid of", Wade said.
Volcanoes throw ash over Mexico City
Ash speared from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after activity erupted in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash spills in 24 hours.
The center monitored the space and vibrations over several routes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote anniversary
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence-seeking protesters clashed with security forces as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back U.S. troops, threw powder and paint, and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also fights later that day, when police used their staffs to keep the fighting down.
For several hours, independence groups chanted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and met Unionist protesters who chanted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, the local press reported.
The vote in the independence-minded region remains high, a year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low and those opposed to the split boycotted the vote in a big way.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped the night before Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dared hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at having the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Although they won a narrow but important regional election last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either been exiled or are in detention awaiting trial for their role in the vote and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There's going to be more and more tension", he said.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
"The nomination of a candidate for the European elections is the best way to distance ourselves from the setback of democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
London: Arrested men after house hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry multiple times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7.30pm BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was reported to the gates and the building itself.
It is possible that an armbrush was also fired at the car at some point.
Shots from Menga give Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The upset Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Mengas's shot made the difference as Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won the league championship this season and will face the leading team, the Hearts, who are eight points behind next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, is extending their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to lose since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing the odds of cash shortages
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct style of play created big problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal after slipping in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-over header in front of the goal.
The home team was happy to have the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the missing team problems in death row situations.
And it was under these circumstances that the important goal came.
The Rangers made a free throw, and Livingston took advantage of an opening, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to create the opening for Menga, who made a touchdown and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defence, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually unchallenged.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped by Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's death penalty situations.
There were regular pitches on Livingston's pitch, but they were dismissed, and two penalties were denied after Halkett tackled substitute Glenn Middleton and one hand on the ball.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal effort and a strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played great, exceeding the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and lineup have remained largely unchanged since their return to the top flight, but much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he's strengthened the team since joining.
There were a lot of heroes.
Commander Halkett was amazing, leading a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've been really good under Gerrard at times, but they played below the level.
Their finishes lacked sharpness  only once they got the home team  and it's a sudden awakening for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There have been disagreements on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police for security reasons prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents, many of them Kurdish, also commented and condemned Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to enter the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Accident on the way to Deptford: Motorcyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, Southwest, around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers on the scene, but the man died on the scene.
The accident comes a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been put in place, bus routes have been re-routed, and motorists are urged to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during riots
Six prison guards have been injured in a high-security prison riot, according to the Prison Office.
There was a riot at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30am on Sunday, and the riots are still ongoing.
Specialised Tornado officers have been called in to handle the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending longer time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was being treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, U.S. Marshals were called to the prison to handle serious unrest when staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressure rarely hits Arizona, but it is most likely to occur early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States, creating a risk of storm surge.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rainfall with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the storm zone, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious issue, but it is likely that some of the rain will be of benefit because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drylands Monitoring Bureau, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second highest category", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still hurricane-force Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore decreasing in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical force on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can become heavy and pose a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with a possible drop of up to 254 mm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary expected hazard from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert regions of the United States", reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm surges and floating precipitation in deserts and landslides in mountain ranges.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police have urged anyone who may have cellphone recordings of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the control of the Democratic Party's "evil and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to "the evil, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his accusers.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote of affirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of affirmation by one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an amazing public service background", he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination, while discussing the importance of Republicans running for office in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important decisions of our lives will be made.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me", he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block".
The first major Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, a senior Republican Party official told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six metres high hit the coast at dusk, sweating many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threats occurred yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach, they didn't run immediately and became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it pulled cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that many others managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster relief agency has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afternoons continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The quake's range was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and that may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive", saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-kilometer-long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely crippled without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living here", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts for not reporting a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media can be heard on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings of tsuami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the evacuated population is still in dire need of food and basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely arrived in Palu city, where employees are seeking shelter under the pruning posts set up in the yard by their account.
"They told me that so many houses were destroyed", he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid organizations began the hard work of resuming relief work, complaints emerged that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad may only enter if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open up to international assistance, but there is no status yet".
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family held on to the missing people in the hope that their closest relatives would become the miracles that illuminate the bleak tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr Gendon told how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulating in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, resulted in only one gray fly instead of two blue.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he says.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling up a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport Police.
The driver of the car had emptied the cash machine in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "behind Brink's employee" and stole a pocket money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses said several suspects fled the scene, according to the press release, but police did not say how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, writing, "The former Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current stage name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier that year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye  which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of a number of famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported preferring the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also switched between lowercase and uppercase letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory strike against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements rocked many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have issued statements on artificial intelligence, but the US still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take the lead in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for AI, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions sponsored by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would be held to identify the next visionaries.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders, it's the big corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years hired university star students to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically have been offered work permits.
The Chinese government's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a way that is similar to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies' distribution of money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint AI center to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over USD 100 million per year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation attempting to create a national intelligence security commission has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote on changing the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to the 'Republic of North Macedonia', a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain EU and NATO membership.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has therefore used its veto when Macedonia has applied for membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the voter turnout will be the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price to pay for the accession of EU and NATO alliances to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but some Members have said they will respect the result and make it official.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state Election Commission said there were no irregularities reported at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children, we belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, participated in the Macedonian vote on a change of the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and EU membership in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who wanted to boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with a raised forehead, not the back door", said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote for it because over 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a yes vote would be a "safe of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote  less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, voter turnout must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provisional Government since it took office in May last year.
Look, Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is struggling through Brighton's defence and scoring.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score coming in after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery in the middle of the line at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed three Brighton defenders before he fainted on the open course.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a left turn and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch of the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to outsmart Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal in that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball deep within Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery down the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the furthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward punched the ball in the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to drill the Rockies.
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still a chance to make the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played one more game than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least held on to a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title in the series.
"Even though we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest level I'm going to be up against this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited about playing under these circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting position for Sunday, but will likely put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the grid for the 34th time, trained his pitches on Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is his usual day off.
The right-hander from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding a ballot in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans appearing in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- you can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me.
Trump continued, "You can see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they're determined to get back in power by any means available, and you can see how evil, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "struggle and block".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "bullish and vicious and disgusting and lying".
He mentioned the top Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, which triggered a loud public outcry.
"Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, what.
No, no, wait a minute. That was really bad body language. That was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a long line of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome  just because we have given our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship measure was about criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In view of the importance of responsible economic policy, in view of national security, in Europe, ironically, similar problems in which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, the meetings on Friday night have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not that, and the promise of a 'friendlier, milder' policy is far from the past if it ever comes into effect.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all views are weighed against the party leadership's acceptance.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader when colleagues, with whom I previously thought I shared a political stance, began to expect me to make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with  whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly  and it really doesn't matter what I say  there are a long string of rude messages on social media calling for the withdrawal and opposition to the middleman policy and telling me that I should not be a Labour member.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are usually political.
I have a deep respect for the professionalism and the willingness to fight of my colleagues who are daily overwhelmed with sexism or racism but still struggle.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a culture of tolerance.
But in reality it is no longer a spatial organisation and with every vote of no confidence or change in the election rules the party is smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that if I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself and not being so hard on myself, I'm gonna "get along".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, when I was in school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government's negligence that had left our classroom in a state of decay, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most  whether it has been as a councillor or a minister in the government.
I never hid my politics, not even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country fails to move towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the local voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of election or political appropriateness will deter me from acting on what I believe is in your interest.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr topped the table
Two late scores may have given the final result to paint an untrue picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazingly entertaining match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the points table and the only undefeated team out of 10.
In the end, it was their superior defense as well as their better use of chance that brought home the home team, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been tough so far, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "With respect to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scottish national player Rory Hughes, which was awarded to the Warriors match, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score which was not followed up by a kick.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the half, scoring and then getting a solo score, leaving Ayr 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, narrowed the score gap to five.
There was then a long break because Ruaridh Knott had been seriously injured, and was carried off the pitch on the barrel.
Ayr's acting manager Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose exploited their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the advancing Ayr club.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the stumps and followed up with a more almost immediately after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent batsman Gregor Henry away to homefield fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran looks set to make the jump to the restaurant business after it emerged that he has taken over as CEO of an authorized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in alongside his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' final, and it appears Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source hinted to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant market".
"The sea is ours": Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling the Navy's headquarters, which is shrouded in rain, in La Paz.
On public buildings, there is a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It is a duty to take it back".
The memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong throughout the inland state of Bolivia, and so is the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
Hopes may be at their highest for decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and naturally awaits the outcome with a positive outlook", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice's decision on the big screen throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will support Bolivia's commitment to negotiate the granting of sovereignty over an area of access to the sea to Chile after decades of negotiations.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, is also at stake in the impeachment hearing on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia's side and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, has no power to cede Chilean territory and has stated that it cannot determine the outcome of any possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice is appealing the verdict only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have been a setback.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership", said Zárate.
Morales' warlike rhetoric has destroyed the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end a 139-year era of disagreements and gain mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political tool.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The suspension of the trial is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past".
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were made in the wake of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently facing a resumption of the nuclear diplomacy that was locked up over three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare unless Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collections of large headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, you'll find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne raised the veil on the catwalk for an extraordinary collection of extra-large headwear as part of their SS19 collection.
A lot of impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work by Valentino was a lavish one with a feather-like broad shadow that covered the models' heads.
There were other extra-large accessories, too, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had compounded lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like a snorkel and a mask, and another creature looked like a melted waffle.
And if you continue with the great counterstatements, you're lucky.
Stylish scouts predict that the huge hats could reach stores near you.
The giant hats arrive on the heels of "La Bomba", the 60-centimeter-wide straw hat that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat that was spread on social media has sent a new big creation down to the catwalk  a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model that shows it.
The orange bag of bast with bast frills and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in general stores next summer, and the designer has had such an influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories of huge size".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many excellent academic results behind them and continue to do so in 2018 with a number of outstanding results, which are further reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other local endeavours.
With up to 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can compose and implement a tailored curriculum, we are finding that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it touches his heart".
It's an important reminder that we can't just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest results this year that languages are the top candidate in the statistics for the most independent schools.
In all, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the high grade of A.
The data collected by the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of pupils received A grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language choice is now being taken at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons why employers were unable to fill vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More jobs will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career the young people choose, if they have learned a second language, they will have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competitors.
According to a YouGov opinion poll of over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multilingual percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to invest in language education for children today.
When children are able to speak several languages, especially languages from developing countries, they have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages in which they are taught.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK in the run up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At present, there is no denying that languages continue to be very important for the future of the country in a global business environment and that this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to the young people of Scotland.
It's got to be done.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is making his debut for the Lakers Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he's playing yet.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is most likely not going to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' planned six preseason games.
"I don't need pre-season games to be ready", he said.
Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a strip voter rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump's appointed Supreme Court justice has been put on hold, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
When is Trump's election in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
The election of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (Danish time) between Saturday, November 29 and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election in West Virginia online via YouTube.
Trump will most likely speak at this week's hearing on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which was tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, and the expected Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for a week as the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary goal of this strip-searching is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said the five election meetings next week are aimed at "growing energy among volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majority", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign season", a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be named, told Reuters.
The evening's election is being held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to step up to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political science professor at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show fighting spirit and try to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-way laps, Saturday's four-man duel was perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but a concept that players believe in  especially in competitions like this one.
So where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we're probably seeing that as a bit of momentum", Jordan Spieth said before holding the fourth.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, they are four points ahead and there are 12 more points to play.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel they've got a little wind in their sails, and there's a lot of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast three out of four possible points.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green, setting a good example for his teammates.
The high cheers grew as the round went on, and Spieth hit an important pitch that secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His pitcher who secured them the game at hole 15 was met with a similar scream  the kind of scream that shows he doesn't think the American team is out of the competition yet.
"You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your own fight", Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the greatest story in Ryder Cup history.
Europe's odd but nice couples have scored four points in four games and appear to be flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow to and from the wild crowd shows that it is those who will be the hardest to beat on Sunday, and it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were to be won by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Most synchronous on each of their holes.
It is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly sued Sergio Garcia in the morning in the four-man duel when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogey on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
On Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and two-player games are so fascinating to watch at close range because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change in a flash.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a big lead ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup, after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and foursomes with a lead over the United States of America at 10-6.
The successful duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far earned four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bears' European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inaccurate American team at the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the foursomes, won four games, but still lagged behind.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles if they're going to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who have collectively been nicknamed "Molliwood", are after a sensational weekend the only other pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a fearless Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had a little genius, but now he's lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and got a 2-1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka who is ranked third in the world.
Europe is doing exactly what it wants to do on a light, hot day southwest of Paris.
Double major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas led the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They were heavily defeated 2-1 by the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team struggled to recover from a four-point lead to the singles.
After two days as the second-best, it seems they can't handle a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce its distrust of the United States and that the country will not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Worldwide Organization's General Assembly that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" within the past year, for example by halting nuclear and missile tests, setting up a nuclear testing site and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States", he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and disarm unilaterally".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-by-phase" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps, his speech seemed important because it did not unambiguously reject unilateral disarmament, as previously had been the case with Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work on "nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to the softening of international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a wish among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are reinforcing our distrust".
Ri did not mention any more plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea rather than the United States, the negotiations would not be so tight".
Nevertheless, the tone of Rice's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile launch on the US mainland was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened the UN with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for his courage in disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea recedes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its steps.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council must uphold sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to halt Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines during the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, while North Korea accused him just hours later of making "cruel demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile and nuclear facility if the United States took "corresponding steps".
He said Kim had told him that the "compliant steps" he demanded were the security pledges Trump made in Singapore, as well as moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students taking a class on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep, and the goal of the course is to counter the growing macho culture where you study all night long and are kept on high levels of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world's best universities often do not know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has completed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the presentation was over, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why do I have to know this now that I'm on the job?'
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can improve their academic and athletic performance and overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health department, says the university decided to offer the course after finding out that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course consists of interactivity.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how poor sleep affects your athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part of the course, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive map of the campus.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect your health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride in taking an all-nighter still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said. It even counteracts weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think you're hungry, why you're constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped organize the course last year when he took one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a universal course for the entire university.
He hopes that the next step will be for all graduates to be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up, which can raise awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic displays that can move at daytime and make falling asleep more difficult.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goal from Menga knocks Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat at the plate as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's disconnected team had to take thanks with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were out after their first league win since the 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard the second defeat in 18 games as coach, leaving Hearts eight points up in first place of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers squad could not respond to.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston is crawling up to third place after Hibernian with only the goal difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that appeared to be coming from the arcade section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the setup that reached the semi-finals of the Betfed Cup by passing Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, faced the same 11 who shaved a point of Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been happy to see his sharp team exhaust the opponents across the court.
The Rangers had the most balls, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Meng's opening act sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt failed.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs made its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive player Alan Lithgow kicked past the backstop.
The Rangers took control, however, but played more on hope than ability in the offensive game.
Alfredo Morales was at least not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless were bringing together after a quarter-final.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejarias tame shot.
Although Livis' opening in the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a death penalty situation in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in the goal.
During the break, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave a kick when the winger sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston's absence forced him to play on their premises with many long balls on the pitch from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the lead in the final part of the game, but McGregor turned Jacobs down with a safe hand before Lithgow headed to the side of the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty kick after being drained with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way.
Yearbook: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today  if we count...  was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the device known as the geiger counter.
The geiger counter has become a staple of both science and popular culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as peasant scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes".
Evans: "Wait, it's on now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "makes several cancers develop", including breast, ovarian, lung, and intestinal cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a specific type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an inconsistent performance on Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was booed while praising US President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president himself in 2020.
After playing the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he began a drum talk against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL started the evening with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the criminal prosecution of Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirades to social media.
It's uncertain if Rock was trying to expose West by uploading the footage.
West also complained to the audience about the poor treatment backstage due to his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there wearing that hat.'
They bullied me!
And they said I was deeply sunk", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I'm sunk?" and said that he would wear his Superman cap because it means, "You can't decide what to do.
Try it with love".
Audiences were shocked at least twice by his comments, and the SNL staff appeared embarrassed, Variety reports with a comment from a person present: "There was a lot of silence in the studio".
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was endorsed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: Thank you for not making you a fool of the people".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "just who he is, and that's fine".
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his 'art') who embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed to.
And so have we", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced that he had changed his name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rap colleague Snoop Dogg has nicknamed Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to appear in the lower court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is longing for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swirling the sword as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero, saying that television characters like this often mean that young men feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem was "very much in his mind".
"I'm very concerned about the current situation. Where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what have we learned from young men growing up?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the highly masculine characteristics.
He continued: "What is born, and what is taught?
What is it that young men learn from television and the streets that makes them feel they have to be men like this?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change that?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong with the young men".
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be making a sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit is set to star in a November reboot of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best part of the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so in that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Lesley's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet established a specific measure to prevent the use of the drug in the Union.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities say at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an urgent problem in China's LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of use of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data on Republican senators and slammed "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denied Saturday allegations that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims came from websites and backed by "the far right".
"Lies, lies and more terrible lies", Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The information released allegedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites like Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters' staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations is in no way responsible for this leak.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a direct lie".
Waters's statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It is a furious denial", wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
If you're being accused of something you didn't do, don't get angry.
You can't be defiant.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your mind calm".
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is seeking to take over Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if that's true", he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she said her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations".
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for their destructive and dangerous actions to everyone and everyone on my staff".
Johnny English is back. Amazing spy comedy starring Rowan Atkinson.
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent British-made films, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the bold, sarcastic self-satire about how hard we are faced become the country's new export option?
At least the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes has been given permission to make noises again and again, and his name more than anything indicates that he is a comical invention aimed at places where theatrical visitors do not speak English.
He's, of course, the stuffed secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife-edge Mr. Bean and a real laughing stock of him performing a single note to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international locusts box that left chaos in its wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this recent shot at the tribe from JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter with a medieval weapon and the propellers rang against his helmet.
You can see Atkins' talent for physical comedy, but the humor feels pretty subtle and oddly superfluous, especially now that more "serious" movies like 007 and Mission Impossible also feature compelling comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film flops in the role of Mr. Bean.
The endlessly timely starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the agent responsible, unfortunately a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and hard-working prime minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the script.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she's forced to cancel someone's pension.
And of course, that's the shitty Johnny English, who is now a superintendent of a high school, but who is secretly teaching you how to become a secret agent.
English is rushing back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with his hard-working former right-hander Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an over-enthusiastic but well-meaning U-boat captain, a role that Vicki Pepperdine plays.
Thus, the royal intelligence service's completely unhinged Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is stumbling close to being infiltrated by the charismatic and eerie tech billionaire Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their furious, risky escapades: Dressed as servants, they set fire to a prominent French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard the luxury yacht of the Volta; and English creates sheer ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the Volta house.
All the cannons are fired in the closing sequence of the film, but as well-meaning and energetic as it is, there's a sense of children's television.
It's pretty mean.
And as I couldn't help but think with the other Johnny English films: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will give his talent justice?
Labour refuses to deal with a plan for a four-day workweek with unchanged pay for the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the British can settle for a four-day workweek but get paid for five.
The party is alleged to have corporate leaders use their artificial intelligence (AI) savings to give employees an extra day off.
That would mean that employees would have three days' weekend without a pay cut.
Sources say the idea would be consistent with the party's economic goal of moving the country in a more worker-friendly direction.
The Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year".
"It will not be done in one day, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits the Party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of workers and to the Party's overall strategy for industry".
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day work week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
The aim is not supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not the policy of the Party and is not under consideration in the Party".
Labour's shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "users" in utilities.
The shadow finance minister's plans also raise doubts about whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, given that a Labour government could "counterbalance" them on the grounds of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to recruit workers to the company's boards and to set up an ownership fund to distribute 10% of the share value of private companies to employees who are expected to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their voice.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that could change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course", Kennedy said.
"When I entered the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was a man of steel, determined and unambiguous".
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be in stone.
"I have made my decision with respect to Brett Kavanaugh, and otherwise would require a very violent charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett denied it most forcefully", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the things she mentioned could confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see that it should change anything".
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City hosts the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive lineup of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end world poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the grand squares of Central Park, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international charity that strives to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, writing to a world leader, making a phone call or other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to reach their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really changing, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism  that people feel they're making a difference by signing a signature collection online or tweeting?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by their members aimed at various goals.
They believe that these actions have prompted world leaders to make binding targets and policy actions worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had resulted from their actions, amounting to over $10 billion already paid or raised.
The group estimates that these funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investment and business partnership that aims to "help children reach their full potential" and pledges $35 million to address nutrition issues in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, governments of other countries and global citizens like you, social inequality with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told a London concert audience in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It's going to be a long, hard battle, and sometimes we're going to stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movements, it will succeed because we are stronger together".
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York City, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman to be the hosts.
The United States could use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, says the US Secretary of State
"If necessary", Washington could use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria  particularly where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government  is an excuse to expand sales of their energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe", he should have said.
And he says there are methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability with our fleet to ensure free passage on sea routes, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure their energy does not enter the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that considers itself to be "the voice of American energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were basically the same.
"The economic opportunities with Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel", he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To achieve this, spokesmen for the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal competition conditions and is merely due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, BDI, has asked the United States to intervene outside EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies", said BDI leader Dieter Kempf after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "strongly considering" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is "strongly considering" running for president after the midterm elections, she said Saturday.
During a board meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman at the front", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren expressed his opinion on President Donald Trump at the city council, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course, the FBI should investigate the case before the vote".
However, a Thursday poll shows that most of Warren's own backyard doesn't think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not cast ballots.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The opinion polls showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% in favour and 48% against a possible set-up.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will announce his final decision in January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a polling station for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the Army in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through after he gets home allows me to relate to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return home with", she told audiences at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harsher, and they are going to think about whether there is respect for what their counterparts on the ground and in the air and all the other members of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in intoxicated state, said Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a nonpartisan statement in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, NBC News reports.
The applicant's full name in Grace v. Sessions, filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal law, has not been released.
She states that her partner "and his violent gang-member sons" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers come from, as countries with widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum law reversed a decision by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney Karl Racine said Friday that the new law "is a departure from decades of state, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle", the statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law against rejecting immigrants damages the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide necessary labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political position", Sessions said in his June 11 proclamation of the law.
It was never intended that asylum should solve all the problems  or just all the serious problems  that people around the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, efforts to find survivors in Palu become desperate.
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her little fever-stricken boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We are running out of clean water".
The inhabitants now returned to their devastated homes to sort through the blood-soaked property and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were also hit by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, could not keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside Palus Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outside for severe aftershocks.
He had tears in his eyes when he told how the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck against a broken wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of misconduct and propaganda
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that trumpeted the benefits of US-China cooperation, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid drinking in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other's imports.
China's trade war retaliatory tariffs would hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for years, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday newspaper in the Des Moines Register that China "is ramping up the use of the unfinished methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the proud American tradition of free speech and press by running a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, however, you will find only a few dissenting voices, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's different views on China's worrying economic direction, as the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against sexual assault allegations, analysts warn they will experience a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has stirred up emotions and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the vote continue.
"This cannot be reversed", Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts Republican Senator Jeff Flake's Arizona request for an 11 hour FBI investigation will soften voter anger.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday  they don't forget tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, protesters shouted, "November is coming!" as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to reach new heights", independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
"People say it's already reached a high level; it's true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters  18-29 years old  who rarely vote despite disliking the president".
Even before Ford's public accusations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had pointed out that it could be a setback if the Republicans continued the nomination.
"It's become a worse mess for Republicans", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it's also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her", points out Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats' election to the news channel.
But Americans seem to have shared views on who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, the latter of whom has a little more on their side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was either likely or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's request, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology giant is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the Inrupt plan is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solids technology so people can create their own "online personal data collection" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about online personal data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to Inrupt's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to bring together resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether they should change everything completely so that all of their business models suddenly become redundant".
"We're not asking for your permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Victorian Cross of World War I is celebrated
The only English priest to win the Victoria Cross fighting in World War I is being commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never received the news that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, at least one of his two grandchildren was unveiled at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's disorderly exploits.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery".
He later ran to the front line and led his men out with "the greatest manhood" before attacking an artillery piece alone and disabling three cannons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918  just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but it humiliated me".
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores the true heroism".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but got Gurli Pig instead.
Imagine you've been up all night watching the stellar Bellator 206 and you're denied the main event.
There were 13 matches on the San Jose program, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown all night in England on Channel 5.
At 6am, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Pig.
Some were unimpressed after waking up early in the morning to this very fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a children's animated film as "a sort of sick joke".
"The legislation made this content inappropriate at 6 a.m., which is why they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, when asked about the program.
"Gris Gurli, yes. "
The Bellator CEO, Scott Coker, said they would work to include English audiences in the planning for the future.
"When you think about the re-send, I think we can make it work", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to that until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me, when I got the shift, I got a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you, it won't happen next time.
We're just focused on five games instead of six, like we usually do, trying to give our fans something extra, and then we're out of time.
It is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley had "minority" about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less valuable than anyone else in his adulthood because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize until he got into the big leagues that "everyone is not like me".
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said he was less interested in winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The longtime host of the radio show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first program, and said he felt "less worthwhile" than anyone else in his life because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, the feelings of being remembered and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used her participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for the decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and that he would give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man  the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said that it's hard to find anyone of his age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age  he went to his first Olympics at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that "his whole outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would all be about me winning a gold medal", he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London 2012 when he was going to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympics.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection  Proud by Heather Small  which had meant a lot during the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.

Kick Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to do something about his form if it's not going to be a sad mile.
Mickelson, who is record-setting for the 12th time to compete in the competition, which takes place every two years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the center of events for the United States as usual, the five-time winner had to play the game of cheerleading and practice his game in the hope of correcting the pitfalls.
Even at the peak of his career, he was not the most straightforward, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes stray shots.
And if the pitch wasn't big enough, Mickelson will be meeting the ever-precise British Open winner Francesco Molinari at game nine on Sunday, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are starting the 12 singles, start strong, Mickelson's fight could be decisive.
Furyk did not show surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a great faith in himself".
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's given so much to these teams before  and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined he was gonna play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it was.
He wants to be out there like everyone else".
On Sunday, Mickelson broke Nick Faldos record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been fully measured by his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence contributes to something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room", he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes much more than just the game".
Captain Thomas Bjørn of Europe knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup singles competition can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just about to be recovered before the finish line with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a good lead in Valderrama, we had a good lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just exactly won", says Bjørn after watching the 2018 team win both 5-3 on Friday and yesterday for an overall lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna be full of junk by tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what's on the other side  the best golfers in the world".
Enchanted by his players' performances on a difficult course, Bjørn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it is individual achievement that counts, and it is something else entirely.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all the parameters as a golfer.
That's what players need to understand. Get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he must also bring out the best in himself".
It looks different to opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fury himself has experienced a lot of hardship on the last day, first on the winning team in Brooklyn before losing when Europe made the Miracle at Medina.
"I remember every word", he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want a good start, like you saw at Brooklyn, like you saw at Medina.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We put our teams together in that order and put the players on the field in the order we feel.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the relegation and will face Rory McIlroy in the top flight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it will secure us all the way through", Bjørn said of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship is being postponed again
The German navy's latest frigate was supposed to be ready in 2014 to replace Cold War warships, but the Germans have to wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price tag, local media report.
The commissioning of the largest ship in the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, the "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a spokesman from the military.
The ship was to have joined the fleet in 2014, but compliance problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered back by the fleet in 2007 are to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the new frigates is a lower maintenance requirement: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships  which are said to make Germany appear as an overseas power factor  will already be outdated when deployed, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of critical "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were to be operated by a crew of 120 sailors  only half the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also appeared that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the possibility for the fleet to make future updates.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important given recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defence committee, admitted that the fleet was "lack of deployment-ready ships".
The official said that the problem had grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were ready to join the fleet.
The National Trust is sneaking into the secret lives of the bats.
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands tries to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help with future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common bat, dwarf bat, long-horned bat and water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected locations in the area to record the activity of bats during the season.
Data from NTS personnel and volunteers are also collected using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the frequencies of the flying squirrels and show which species do what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of their habitat are produced.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to identify the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of ponds and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban development projects that affect shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials, and pet attacks.
The bats are not actually blind.
But because they hunt primarily at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use advanced eco-location techniques to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect ships and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scotland's bats.
The area's custodian, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is much not known about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help them understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on property, as the destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, putting an entire local population at risk of extinction.
The bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or their prey.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to join in.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how populations evolve".
Ronaldo rejects rape prosecutor while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape accuser against him "fake news" and says people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It's alleged that he paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, criticizing the information as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They're gonna promote themselves by using my name.
It's not uncommon.
They'll be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called, according to Reuters, "an unforgivable publication of suspicions about privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption of a class similar to the charge, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly took her back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to the report filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99 percent of the time" grabbed by "the one percent".
The court papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got her injuries photographed in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old now says she will reverse the deal, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was due to take place, and this summer he was traded to the Italian giants Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' the loss of carmakers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Commerce Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'concerning' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal it would temporarily reduce production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that longer waiting times at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"The way I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March", said Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are expressing fears of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade agreement.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the supply chain risks in the event of a withdrawal without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border problems that the car industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire plant and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed to precise avoidance of these border checks".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that not only allows us  as I call it  to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been a successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trusted colleague at the factory, says that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience tells me that once these jobs disappear, they will not return".
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "stay postponed for another week" as the list of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein looks over the shoulder of Special Counsel Robert Mueller as he investigates Russian election meddling, ties between Trump's aides and Russia and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Attorney General and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been a topic of talk in Washington for months.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of firing the president via paragraph 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and there was a rumor that he was going to quit.
Instead, a meeting was arranged Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed back a week with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I like to keep the press updated".
Some journalists would challenge the claim that Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to TV journalists playing for the gallery, but added: "I don't disagree with the way they play up to the camera".
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president is receiving more press questions than any president before him", she said, adding, without citing a source, "We've looked at the numbers".
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to give rich opportunities for that, and you've seen us do that over the last few weeks, and that's going to be in the press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why by making an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the press.
Minister for Health contacts EU healthcare workers following Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express their country's gratitude and wish for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its seconded public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued and decisions are likely to be made in the autumn.
But the British government has also increased its preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know this must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts made by each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU bring valuable experience and expertise that reinforce and improve healthcare work for the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would very much like you to remain.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the incident happened before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a rig and taking him in for further investigation.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are "no details yet on the type or extent of the damage", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he sustained the damage.
Abercrombie is a sophomore in college and is entering his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, giving him 18 tackles overall this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher voting taxes when they buy houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher voting tax when they buy a property in the UK.
This is a feature that will dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher voting tax will hit those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects it will provide £120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May is today proposing that foreign buyers be charged a higher voting tax when they buy property in the UK for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and pursuing those with the highest incomes.
The increase in the polling tax will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the proceeds from this will be used to support the government's campaign to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current voting tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on purchases of multi-family homes and rental purchases, can reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects it to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by people living abroad, which causes prices to rise and makes it harder for first time buyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many of the country's rich areas, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the voting tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land they do not use, and he asked May to drop quotas on cheap housing to address Britain's "shameful housing situation".
Corbyn has proposed a series of striking housing reforms, including a check on rental prices and the removal of the landlord's ability to put people on the streets if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life would be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be that it is as easy for foreign firms and individuals living outside the UK to buy housing as it is for hardworking Britons.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the dishonesty of sleeping on the street is still too common".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club, which now sits third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking back at St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland on the Hampden with my father as a child, and it's always drawn me in.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I had success in coaching clubs".
Ross's predecessors as coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he had no qualms about following the established names of such a big club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success by 'can I get this club back in the Premier League.'
From the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his coaching career after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month absence as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to come back after being relegated to the third-best row and transformed St Mirren from relegation to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalls his time in Alloa.
"I honestly believed that coaching was right for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds weird, because I did it well, earned a fair amount of money, and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still the kind of stress and pressure that comes with training, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I've never been more comfortable with myself in my adult life".
You can hear the entire interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12pm and 1pm BST.
Best time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., study shows
The heat wave this summer has increased the revenue of pubs in England, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants fell by 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant who collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup has meant that July follows the June pattern where pubs saw 2.8% sales, except that restaurants are hit harder now.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the sale of beverages were clearly the best performers and experienced a growth similar to the decline in restaurants.
Pubs focused on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Across pubs and pubs, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% per month, while food fell by 3.3%.'
Paul Newman, an analyst of the service industry, said: "Results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to out-of-home sales, the weather and large social or sporting events are the main factors.
It is not surprising that restaurants are still struggling, even if a fall in sales of 4.8% year on year will do a real disservice to rising costs.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide much needed breathing space".
The total increase in sales for pubs and restaurants combined, including new opening, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a decline in brands launched.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for UK pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 different groups, with annual sales of over £9 billion and a leading player in the field.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children  up to 11 years old  have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study shows.
A survey of 20,000 students in grades four through nine reveals a rise in fake Insta sites.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted
20% of students said they have a "main account" they can show their parents
One in five children under the age of 11 creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in fourth grade and beyond reveals a sharp increase in fake Insta accounts  a reference to the image-sharing service Instagram.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while also having private accounts.
A mother who was caught up in her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager urging others to "rape me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics at the Annual General Meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and chairman Ian Bettie described the move as a good opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from her extensive 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys a high reputation in the athletics world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that Scotland's athletics will benefit from her being on the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help to the direction of sport in Scotland".
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now a frequent commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said time would tell if I would get over it and to what extent.
It's been a lot of hard work, but I'm completely healthy, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows receives mixed response online
An online breastfeeding company has shared opinions with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump", the consumer technology magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired ad that aims to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a manger filled with hay to a song where the bla says, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't breasts, these are my breasts".
The egg says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my breast".
But the ad, which has been posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers, many saying it makes fun of the "terrific" dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth", wrote one user.

Another wrote: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: "What a rude advertisement".
Another woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product", wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at work or in toilets) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their braces.
The concept behind the ad is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving the women freedom to move, hold their children and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breastfeeding, while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can provide".
This isn't the first time the pump from Elvie has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has exploded, although the number of border crossers has not changed, partly because of harsher rhetoric and the Trump administration's stricter laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by showing up and accepting a child.
The risk of being sent home increased in June when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would be required to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to Congress that they had arrested several individuals who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had pure criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still hunting those people", Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the handling of the children's cases, authorities have introduced new rules requiring that some of them appear in court within a month of their detention, previously within 60 days, aid workers say.
Many people use video calls instead of coming in and speaking their case for legal stay before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for residence are deported quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempted escape, according to aid workers and reports from the system in recent months.
Advocates for better relationships say that these risks are more pronounced in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where size makes it harder to monitor whether a child suffers.
They added that moving to a tent town without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can relieve traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria announces immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
When Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the presence of foreign forces in the country was illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism and they would "be met with similar means".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terrorism was "almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian areas" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said that conditions were good enough to allow them to return home, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fear" that caused the refugees to flee.
"We have urged the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these return missions", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be made available to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel-held city of Idlib has opened the door for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would follow jihadists from the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda outfit that "will be wiped out".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to draft a postwar constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to 'reviewing the legislation of the current constitution', and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another term.
From that logic, Trump will likely be re-elected in 2020 unless the state court case and scandals end his presidency prematurely, as many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!"
There's no sign of vision loss at this time.
Since 2014, the highest-rated viewership has nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its peak, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers, with up to 3.5 million on big-news nights.
"It's a spectacle that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's Designated Survivor, about a cabinet leader who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxonomy in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike any other television program, the stories coming out of Washington can determine Roe and Wade's case about whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
That changing channels is only the most privileged of the foregoing.
And yet it's more than just being an enlightened citizen when you watch a six-hour panel discussion where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("clad in hybrids", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' vivid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating cast and daily surprises.
But if you miss a paragraph, you're out of your mind.
When I caught Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't force himself to leave, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court to be decided.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows before, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right".

Large sums are on the way to the close midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District receives large sums of money, as a result of a tie between two "Congressional Districts" two congressmen are vying for the same seat.
This newly relocated suburb of Pittsburgh is creating problems for Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a second special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another sitting Congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th District, which overlaps strongly with the new 17.
The maps were re-made after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was illegally turned over to the Republicans.
The campaign for the new 17th District has sparked a fight for financial resources between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-profile election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th District.
The seat has been in the hands of the Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for aiding China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out Trump's leadership team.
State Department officials decided to recall senior U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in an emailed statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received about $140 million from the US in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts to financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development, which was to continue last year's meeting, which was seen as a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, dropping the idea of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference in mid-October to signal the importance Americans place on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new demands or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who would like to discuss internal considerations if they remain anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Know the Story
The next obstacle could very well be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller is also reportedly going to direct his investigation to the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia in the election attack.
If Congress were to get into new hands, Trump would likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet again with voters and, in time, of course, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I am not saying that Trump's final outcome is inevitable, and the same is true of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and failed to take the opportunity to avoid the years-long bloodshed that followed.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns and the inevitable march of democracy increases or decreases.
In the United States, we are now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot since this paper reported that last year he proposed making secret recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times's production is inaccurate.
"What will we do if the FBI's newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is terminated or not properly conducted  or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault charges and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we in the midterm elections vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But based on what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me off to light a Sabbath lamp on the table with the garden cross.
How can I be anything but optimistic about it in my luggage?"
Norman Eisen is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, D.C., and author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien.
The Rangers will play against SK Rapid Wien on Thursday, after an impressive unbeaten performance against Villarreal earlier this month, and with a win over the Austrians they will have a good chance of advancing from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut before the 2-2 win over Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight believing we could get something home, and we got a score.
Maybe we could have gone home, but overall, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is another big European night.
We're hoping to get three points, but it's going to be hard because they did a good job last game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
Last year's been tough because of all the injuries I've had and the changes at the club, but the mood is good now.
The team's good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can start now, put last season behind us and have success".
Anxiety about pension savings makes women sleepless
Although the participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family about it.
About half of the participants in Nationswide's survey said they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they do nothing to start the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationswide's life insurance company.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for the need to care for you if you do not tell them your wishes in time.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to receive care.
Ask your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by traditional long-term care insurance, cash-only life insurance or self-insurance with your own funds  as long as you have the means to do so.
Get the legal documents ready: Take the legal battles in the riot.
Get a power of attorney so that you can have a trusted person handle your medical treatment and ensure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also a financial power of attorney.
In that case, you will appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and ensure that your bills are paid if you cannot afford to do so.
Remember the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy  who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medication?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Get the plan in place".
Man shot several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, middle floor and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m., as "absolutely accidental".
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to step forward.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a major earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, expecting the death toll to rise.
As communication routes are out of order, emergency workers have been unable to receive information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The region is a province of the Autonomous Community of Croatia.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central and Eastern Slovenia, particularly in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Centre, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismically on the so-called Pacific Rim and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the most devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic as the population was reminded of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, a tsunami was not triggered, but over 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, preventing reporting of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on $500 bail without bail, KTUU reports.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, where he pleaded "clearly not guilty", the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which could result in a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a firearm in an impaired condition in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for explaining her son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment to Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5, triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and roads, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Social media has been circulating videos showing the moment the earthquake struck.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get a suspected terrorist in NYC sentenced to the infrequent death penalty.
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people  a rare punishment, which was ultimately sentenced to death for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a cycleway along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who came into the way were shot.
The prosecution must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, as required by the Death Penalty Statement in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible outcome of both of these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder in connection with gangster activity, typically used by public prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "comprehensive planning and preparation", the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "horrible, vicious and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss of life to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the intention statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last visited a defendant in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but ended up serving a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a state case was sentenced to death in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov was from Uzbekistan and according to court documents showed no signs of regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was comfortable with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung up in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had earlier asked the prosecutors not to pursue the death penalty.
Conservative minister says NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "mark the pressure" from eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's own ministers said that Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
The young Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "been out now" if Farage had been Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge to bring the deeply divided party together is underscored by the Conservatives' participation in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attack from both Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels  and thereby force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we'd be out now", he said.
The Wellingborough minister added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must scrap the Chequers".
He said of the background of his opposition to the EU: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong".
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular among our own party and among our activists who are actually on the streets and getting us elected.
Now drop the Chequers and start listening.'
As a tip to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told the rally that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail the decision from the 2016 vote.
"Now it's a question of trust between us  the people  and our political class", he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we are here to tell them that we will not let them go".
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit feels the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory of Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain".
While the remnants marched through Birmingham before a two-hour march into the city centre.
Scattered activists waved Conservative Against Brexit banners after the group's formation this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security issues with the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
"It's the people who claim to have control of the IT systems and technology for Canada, for border controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he said.
"It's ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren is "strongly considering" running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the House of Representatives is "strongly considering running for president" after the midterm elections in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about his future at a council meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, is set to seek re-election in November against state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There's been speculation about whether she'd challenge Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman on the front lines".
Arrested in the shooting of LSU's Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested Friday for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player.
Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested Friday for an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from his injuries", said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present, in possession of a weapon, and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a 6-foot-3 third-year senior who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season, he played 32 games, started in 10 and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton close to World Cup after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a crucial role in the race.
From the driver's position, Bottas got off to a good start and was close to knocking Hamilton out as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in pit first, and let Hamilton struggle with traffic in the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into a pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when the Ferrari driver after some wheel contact reluctantly had to leave the infield after a double defense at third.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh after the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, failing to change tyres in an attempt to finish fast to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to pit in the 44th, but could not accelerate the pace in the last eight laps, which is why Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did amazingly all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did an incredible job of securing first and second place", said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday because she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a West Virginia election, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that events in the Senate showed that people were "wicked and repugnant and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened these last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
"When you look at the statements and the leaks, and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me".
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document?
- No, no, I'm not going to.
I haven't leaked anything".
Hey, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we haven't leaked anything", he added in a simulation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, and I have not leaked her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did".
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said at the election on Saturday: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
During the president's continued defense of the nominated Supreme Court justice who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the allegations to their own advantage.
"They are not shy of any means in their efforts to regain power.
You can see the viciousness, the disgustingness, they don't care who they have to drum for power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars to Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have recovered after losing their Elite League game on Friday to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly took the lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game at home before Dwyer again took the Giants to the front.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants coming out as champions in the previous three games.
Dwyer took the lead in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as the assistant, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy lead, Sullivan brought home the game back to 13:10, before Matt Marquardt tied Cowney at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants led the way at the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard tied again with a great goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the front of the game for the first time late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Airmen died to ensure hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after his death to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still ravaging the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for their lives, he refused to leave his seat in the floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his seat to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, was safely in flight.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said, according to Australian ABC News, that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We obtained a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are crushed", he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country's disaster emergency service says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins and it is not possible to reach them", said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters high have destroyed Palu, who is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying emergency aid and supplies in.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance arrives with more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
All the shops have been looted".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're getting at.
It is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombrok in Indonesia killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said it was unable to locate a male passenger that Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond to requests for further information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go into the water for life to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and screamed and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were renovating a nearby dock also helped with the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in those accidents.
Analysts are timing the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution closed its evidence on Saturday in the case of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telephony to link the case of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis to the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several different cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had alleged that he and his friend Michael Sanford were visiting, police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat down at the witness stand Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone data showed they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip-hop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to basics and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently been revived in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York girl sues couple after firing with "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message in error from her mother, who complained that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied being racist, but compared the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day of work in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. " Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, saying that their former nanny, who was African-American, had been bad at her job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the firing and $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to have lived with the family, even though this was agreed upon without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't afford to do that", she told the paper on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have defended themselves by saying that they are not racists and that Maurice's firing was justified because they feared they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists", Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been uncomfortable with, even if it was by mistake?
Your baby?
I'm telling you the truth".
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "blackmail" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone like that?
This is not particularly kindly done,' the investment adviser added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the People's Court has already written off the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It is hard to imagine being the first to read it before it was published.
It's quite fun to read now that you know how popular Paddington became".
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little garbage can, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bitter" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as "a very important part of our family", and says that her father was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault".
Saying goodbye to dying daughter on the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called from time to time to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you guys later.
The medication she had been given to keep her heart going slowly lost its effect.
She was dead a few days ago, and now she's locking up the body.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try and get myself together".
Eventually, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears kept flowing.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women grieving trying to stop suicide shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he got a depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day", she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, said her son was a promising chef with a dirty smile.
"His smile was known to all.
People said his smile lit up the room".
But he stopped working before he died because he was really sick.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's going to spread".
Sharon Davis created the maps to "tell people that there are people out there you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself  you have to talk to someone".
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sad or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them at all".
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to get through it.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future remains unclear as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for  a limited-scale, limited-time investigation  we might get a little agreement", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "fall out of the way" amid the tightly-fitted partisan situation.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their restraint is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans, as expected, do poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called on senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and there met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean hopefuls 'fall' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South Korean Ministry of Integration and said there were 1,127 hoppers last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human trafficking contributed to the change in numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
In time, the vast majority of North Korean hopefuls will be offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border up to North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the offspring illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forced home.
Relations between North and South Korea  which are technically still at war  have improved markedly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work toward a nuclear-free Korea at a global level.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible that we will disarm ourselves", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit for the Supreme Court
Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was not appropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his high school years, he almost screamed and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and of a coordinated temperament" organized by the left, which was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's statements proved he couldn't sit on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with those statements and the way he followed Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi walked away when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a state court if he was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'd say that if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit on the Supreme Court, but certainly not in the court he's sitting on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding Obama's health care reform or the Roe v. Wade abortion case because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court rulings.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, prejudiced person should contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a just outcome, months and years of anger raging, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual.
She continued: "I got a lot of support from a woman who was a manager, who said that she cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry".
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant".
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was grabbed by the neck of an older woman, a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid of, and pulled out of the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will think you're sorry and they'll accept that they got you".
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Colorado Democratic Party, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed as having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could just as well run for president herself.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision", she said to me smiling 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the uprising, and they certainly didn't need another candidate.
Some called it 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'"
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave 1,000 dollars to men, only gave her 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she made a speech that she would not run, she was overwhelmed with emotions  gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism  that she got a lump in her throat.
"You'd think I was getting a nervous breakdown", recalls Schroeder, referring to the press' reaction to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you gonna write on my gravestone?
"She was crying"?"
So the US-China trade war could be an advantage for Beijing
The opening numbers of the US-China trade war were high, and while the battle is far from over, splits between the countries could be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods is in principle half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has always responded, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second-largest economy probably won't give up just yet.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, it means they're giving in, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, U.S. trade war pressure could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less interdependent.
"A swift decision in either Washington or Beijing could lay the groundwork for an economy that could spiral out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than previously thought", said Abigail Grace, Asia-focused research fellow at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to accept refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the refugees to return and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place to allow refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still in the country are in need of emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government was willing to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that helped support the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six straight European matches and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, shot his drive into the lake at par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari performed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have gone 5-0-0 since 1979, when the current format of the tournament began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 by the lowest-ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Number one on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most successful European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It is a team effort, and I am glad that I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's passing the torch on to his countryman John Ram, who knocked out the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a kid", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
That's a funny statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who's won 14 major titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding form all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the guys for fighting for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we were playing Europe.
We lost.
Take your hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, and I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we're gonna move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to watch the hat.
We were defeated".
Update on algae flowering: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decline in algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, widespread flowering is reported in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier  suggesting declining concentrations.
The flowering of algae spreads over a coastline of 210 km from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are smaller flowering plants about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Flowering patterns have also been observed in Pasco County.
Medium-scale concentrations in or at sea in Pinellas County have been reported over the past week, low- to high-ocean concentrations out of Hillsborough County, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentrations to high concentrations in or at sea out of Sarasota County, background concentrations to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentrations to high concentrations in or at sea out of Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory problems are still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reported breathing problems in northwest Florida in the past week.
