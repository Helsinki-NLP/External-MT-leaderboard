German Football Club boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil ’ s comeback
For Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel there is currently no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he has felt the one or the other apparently, as it is set out in his statement", said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" the "Bild" newspaper.
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92 times national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil would have continued to play for Germany.
Up to a certain point, I also assumed that this would be the case, ” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared in July his resignation from the DFB Team and justified this also with the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a talk with coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it is a pity that this conversation has not come about so far".
Linz: Gartenhütte in Schrebergartensiedlung burned down
At 2: 13 p.m. the Linz Fire Department was alerted to a fire on Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the allotment garden settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and burnt out to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged in a battery for charging.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still has to be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
It should be considerable, however, because the owner had many collector's items in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She obviously wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") streamed live herself, apparently trying to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US-portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family, which claims to have identified her as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family almost flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
They accused the adults of engaging in child trafficking.
She provides no evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching," says Lohan in the video, as she follows the family further down the street.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to have had enough.
It looks as if she turns around and slaps Lohan in the face.
In tears the actress asserts how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "MASCOT" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is said to approach the asteroid Ryugu so closely that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The landing craft "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.

Elon Musk resigns as Tesla ’ s Chairman of the Supervisory Board
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla ’ s chief Elon Musk caused a stir in the stock markets in early August, when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car builder.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla chief withdraws from the board, but he may remain CEO.
Conservative Party congresses in the United Kingdom
Tightly guarded - the Tory Party Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage for a power struggle.
The convention is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues, and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of which is former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached an agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these duplications of names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in future, and that is what the population is voting on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("He who is not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
Its fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Workers ’ Left Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said Chief Development Officer Peter Mertens to the "Automobilwoche" journal.
The imprisoned and released Audi boss Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017, the task force will soon be disbanded.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / gearbox versions are expected to be checked for combinations," he said at the time.
Mr Mertens said: "At the beginning of July we have reached an important milestone in coming to terms with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was established in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi ’ s mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made “serious organisational changes ” so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler ’ s future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi head of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas frauds became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot manages the company as acting CEO.
Because of the changeover to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production losses at Audi, Schot said to the "Heilbronner Stimme".
In principle, he sees a decline in demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot focuses on electromobility.
15,000 reservations have already been made for the first Audi E-car, the e ’ tron.
Grindel aims for re-election - Lahm to serve as DFB president
Mainz (dpa) – Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for the office of DFB president again next year.
"I do my work and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest on early Sunday morning in the ZDF's "Aktuelles Sportstudio".
You have to try again and again to win re-election, that is what I will do.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after winning the European Football Championship in 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016, succeeding Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell victim to the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote at the DFB is scheduled for 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future team leader Philipp Lahm is to participate in the DFB executive committee.
“I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Executive Committee would agree that he will continue to play this role in advising the Executive Committee and then, of course, be cordially invited to share his experience in sporting matters, ” said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Grindel expressed the wish that in the future an international without migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, the Brazilian natives, Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, hold this position.
“If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says, ‘ the issue is important, we have to take care of it ’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work, ” said Grindel.
Decreasing correctly with semi-intelligent scales
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A balance that not only measures my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body is also calculated the mass index, but the thing is rather for the Würscht.
He does not say anything about whether I have replaced fat by muscles.

Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib ’ s mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
During his three-day state visit, Erdoğan had previously met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Walter Steinmeier, among others.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite Gülen supporters living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the Cologne city center had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were deployed, including snipers.
The Islam association Ditib is in the criticism, because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, boos and moment of terror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have campaigned for more involvement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York ’ s Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I ’ m nervous, I sweat, but it ’ s okay, because I ’ m here and I ’ m ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations also appeared on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a moment of shock when many spectators took the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
Briefly panic arose, people ran in disorder.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organiser Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the internet.
Whoever wanted to get hold of one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases on the internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheering and applause from the audience - booing against it for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He and his democratic colleague Chris Coons advocated more equality between men and women on stage.
On Friday, Flake had pronounced in the Justice Committee of the U.S. Senate for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus offended many women against the head.
At least three women have raised accusations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who claimed to have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You are also welcome to meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends the journalist ’ s expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, put on a shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the front row.
The T ’ shirt, was not the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
A strong unrest had arisen from the action of the journalist, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore arranged for the man to be taken out by the guards.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies irrespective of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership of banned parties or the Fethullah ’ Gülen ’ movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: it was only at the beginning of September that the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they were released and able to return to Germany, they are still on trial in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz totally drunk with Ina Müller
His fans normally know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that ’ s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by NDR is known for cheerful conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour bar "Schellfischposten".
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests toast to some beer, some wine or even high-strength drinks to loosen up the atmosphere and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The coolest Day".
But the trip to the far north didn ’ t get him at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled, his eyes only two small slits.
The selfie bed shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - insights, which he has now won: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's Night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leaves out.
The consumption of alcohol is the 43 Years truly written in the face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably most effectively - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the usually attractive movie star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nightly drinking spree.
But since she has been hosting the TV show at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
For a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and filth
The entrance to the 36 kilometers long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood Country in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes are sought against rampant vandalism, but solutions are scarcely apparent.
Scherben, Zigarettenkippen, garbage and garbage, demolished garbage cans and in the meantime dismantled signs - so presents itself since longer the entrance with seat group to the cycle track on the Haaße.
For the showpiece Bahnradweg in Rotkäppchenland a more than inglorious sight.
The topic occupies members of the ADFC in addition, others already longer local group Schwalmstadt, so the bicycle traffic assigned of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
So far there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the boarding point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he also contributed the topic to the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the group of seats is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
It is not only often loud, with the Gelagen also destroyed: Post from the earth torn, garbage bins demolished, signs bent over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers have cleaned up more often, ADFC member Susanne Klippert tells.
But the actions were only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße", confirms the bicycle traffic commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new bike park in Ziegenhain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive".
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "It may raise the threshold to attack common property.
This would, however, require a police patrol to be carried out promptly.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes for a development of the Haaße, or hill.
It had to be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the bike path so far one can be very satisfied.
The touristic marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany ", said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be an extremely critical danger area.
There is no turning track on the Haaße.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is a problem for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the neighborhood offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from the "One Man" band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time Albachtener living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not experienced this in other districts.
What did the lyricists feel connected to?
Among the villages, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue in his hit song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke enlivened the short changeover breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints to their work.
Thus one learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Franke was able to report from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed quite a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the favorites of the jury there was something special - so that others can hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup “Schlager ”, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the“ Lummerland “pack:“ a very nice performance ” with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again at the finale - and sounded "really good" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects originality, relation to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the neighborhood offensive.
The neighborhood offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She considered the event a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
Game: "Decrypto" in game test
The players form two teams, which sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which one - the old trick with the red foil - can decipher only if one inserted them.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything, even by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Cube.
4.
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For what is to be guessed here are not the terms, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card which may read "3.4.2".
Guess in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "dice", "fixed" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct sequence and the opposing team if possible not; because that wins the game, if he succeeds twice to crack the code.
The encoder therefore writes down and reads aloud: "Throwing" for the dice, "lots" as a contrast to party; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "Prague" because he was careful at school and knows the fall of the windows there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
You do not know the terms of the other side - but you can match them better with any hint the encryptor gives there.
So the paraphrases should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you will make things unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time before they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much emotion there is in this inconspicuous game.
But overall "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre "Primus Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And those who are only interested in guessing and not in victory points can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper City, later he was also noticed in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly did not comply with the reprimand by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be held criminally responsible for the use of the marks of unconstitutional organisations.
depot Pressig was home of the push-pull locomotives
The depot in Pressig was for decades the hub in the Franconian Forest.
1991 ended a piece of railway history.
"When buffers hit buffer, you could hear it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
This did not upset anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons rattled.
That was just pure railroad.
Statements that stand symbolically for Dinkels Heimat Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep slopes of the mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters of altitude has its apex in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, train and thrust locomotives were formerly needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway service workshop with 21 engine sheds, apprenticeship workshop, overhead line and railway maintenance.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after being rebuilt in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and 47 years professional railway worker.
Locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben were also operated by the Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160; 13 steam and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 wagons were still in operation per month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were dismantled, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not envisage a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport".
Still at Whitsun 1989 the railway direction celebrated Nuremberg to the anniversary "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pompous station celebration in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here", remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
"The shunting engineers and inhibitors carried out the most difficult work on the trains," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig in Rothenkirchen for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places has led and many more historical and current pictures are here infrankenPlus in the article.
Kerber with Opening Success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing like Julia Görges before.
Kerber won the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world ranking lists is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
She was victorious 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian, who was placed at number 13, gave up.
The Swabian now has to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors saw the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Wind play, performance" was opened in the open-air area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
The host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been with us since the very beginning.
The same goes for Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A few days ago, however, Hahn announced his resignation somewhat surprisingly.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and helped to design flyers.
Once again this year, there will be a 70 Cent special stamp designed by them at Kunst & Genuss, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted by the great popularity of the special exhibition.
For the musical accompaniment, Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Wind chimes" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it through play.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colourful accents.
Already at the entrance of the estate the "lucky tree" of the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau awaits the visitor on the right side.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully provided with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object seems dreamy and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, which dedicates itself preferentially in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K & G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colourful imagination, consisting of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "wind chime" to stroll through the multifaceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate their 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And also the Albachteners gave vent to their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there would no longer be any singing life in the district.
It has become a legend in the meantime: They christened the MGV 68 Albachten on a bench in the Tinnenbusch.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the jubilee was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It will be full today", anticipated Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be proved right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dream Ship", Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the show might have been partly to blame for her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues saw me at eye level, "says Keller in an interview with Bild am Sonntag.
At first she had only been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "Dream Ship".
For now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much".
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been quite envious, but "like many men, Hans was afraid to talk about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried "to be the only one right for Hans von Borsody" and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I disguised myself ", as she explains further.
She always had the feeling "not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, who in truth was never me, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to last forever. "
After a marriage with Thomas Härtner that had already failed, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil wedding I sat in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
Also the marriage to von Borsody failed.
Why did it never work with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at that time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love far too naively. "
The moth, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ Resort Zurich, has this time ventured into the ZFF Opening Party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the glaring brilliance in which a green carpet on Sechseläutenplatz has been bathed blinds him beyond measure.
But it is just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he staggers on this late Thursday night over the square to facilitate himself in the “Aquaclean-Toilet Oasis ” briefly.
This is the name of the public toilet facilities, sponsored by a large sanitary company, which will celebrate its premiere at the festival: the necessity institution on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes an effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the gentlemen's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So out here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who were entertaining the opening film "Green Book" at the cinema next door at the best level, celebrate the beginning of the festival like every year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: as is well known, the works shown come from all over the world.
In an article about this festival, you don ’ t have to come up with all kinds of ideas in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly binds a little ribbon around the antennae, which has been clothed by a fairy godmother, and two beefy bouncers actually wave him generously in.
Inside, the guests crowd, they dance to live music well after midnight or let themselves be dictated by DJ rhythms, to which they shout at each other, and wash down with Cüpli exquisite appetizers.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement oysters wait for sipping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for that!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he is wrong in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry man tips a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the Festival Award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But between local celebrities, the box office desk and kitchen articles, a face passes that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, almost looking like a choir boy at the age of sixty.
He is not talked to, not gaped, at most you look stealthily.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as narrowness, international stars love this film festival.

At the break, the gap was only two goals.
Above all Sendens best, Marius Hintze, met again and again in the phase.
After the change it became even better from visitor point of view.

Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
Encroach upon the impartial.
Bieletzki usually avoids blaming others.
But: The 120 seconds of time penalty, Steffen Mühlhoff cashed, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit until the end four more times - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, in the back also stood well against seven men and thrown again and again on the empty goal.
Only they can buy themselves for compliments a little.
"Now a damned victory must come", so the completely served Bieletzki.
Goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Huegging (1).

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his impending dismissal as head of the multi-billion dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed an out-of-court lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages, in which Musk might lose permission to run listed companies.

Poster at Aldi: Price-reduced to love
Aldi becomes Tinder 2.0?
Who says, in times of Tinder there are no more romantic connoisseurs of stories - should talk at Aldi times about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food" dating by Tinder and Co. the supermarket almost radiates an anachronistic romanticism as a place to get to know love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxershorts, bargains at the bargain table, or your favorite pudding is, in doubt, still a better story for your future grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The App Tinder has the reputation to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock market.
We dared the test: How do women react if you don ’ t talk around the hot potato for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
It has real Hollywood Lovestory potential if the happiness of love is preceded by an end to the lost eyes and rediscovered plot.
If the guy then also under the E-mail, address bio, putenfleisch @ gmx.de with his beloved reports, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and the like - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is to be wished the originator of this advertisement in a Aldi “branch ”, unknown to us, that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the“ 30 percent reduced organic turkey meat ”.
For the belief in the magic of getting to know analogue, she definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood.

Football: Bezirksliga: VfL Wolbeck vs. SC Altenrheine on the pitch
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch had a hard time with his family.
The coach of VfL Wolbeck, the soccer team in the district, withdrew (internally) in order to reflect on the lack of motivation on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it runs again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer voucher is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only waferthin past the ascent.
Yes, I am very happy with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was something to be proud of, "Fetsch praised his boys and went to every single one of them to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4 to 4 to 2 almost seamlessly into a 4 to 2 to 3 1, where Niklas Thewes waiting in the front line for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game parts in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his retirement (17th), the substitute Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost took revenge when the SCA, in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer, hit the Wolbecker Kasten twice in minute 41 – goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break, VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed narrowly.
Also Schroer was late after 58 minutes with a Thewes.
With the substitution of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again gave the left side a fresh start.
When Altenrhein ’ s Chris Naberbäumer was killed by Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the placemakers 18 metres in front of the guest house.
The fouled man himself stood up and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues' thing with the right flop hit down left from the shooter's point of view - 1-0 (71st).
20 more minutes, which were to be fucking long.
And then that was it: In the 80th minute, VfL fte captain Florian Quabeck unhappily hit the ball in the penalty area.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Yannis Schneider did not miss the present (79).
Wolbeck had to overcome anxious minutes in the final part of the race before Geske scored the winning goal in the 87th minute from twelve metres.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske)

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
When landing, it was still at the airfield to the accident.

Report of the Allbright Core Foundation: Women remain a rarity on company boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of 1 September, according to the report "Die Macht der Monokultur" (The Power of Monoculture), which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Comprehensive Foundation and which was presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"Companies will have to change their positions, otherwise international competitors will pass them by," said Wiebke Ankersen, Managing Director of the Foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, all-male management teams - with few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors comparatively less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies can also be attributed solely to positive impulses from companies in the Index of Medium-Sized Values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
At the 30 Dax Companies - pioneers in recent years - stagnated the proportion of women.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women again next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signaled that they will not enter into any further voluntary commitments to increase the proportion of "zero percent".
A different picture emerges from the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women on them was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited to the executive boards every year, a share of 40 percent would have been reached by 2023," the report says.

Ferrari made in the first half of the year with each sold car 69.000 Euros operating profit - Jaguar Land Rover against it comes only on approximately 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley put even with each car strongly up.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well on track with prices averaging between €33,000 and €38,000 per car and around €3,000 in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

Wine princess Lisa II. toasted later symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"Great that so many found their way to us after Abtswind".
On Sunday, on which also the Abtswinder Kirchweih was celebrated, the association had fixed on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon the beverage prices as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the Haus des Gastes, before the second round will be held one day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Ambulance car crashes into taxi
An ambulance stands beside a road, badly damaged.
When the emergency vehicle collided with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured.
If emergency doctors are called, they should help - best of all save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took in Bonn a fatal end for a 26 Years old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency doctor's car with a taxi in Bonn, a 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, as the police announced.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had passed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue lights and Martinshorn.
He then ran into a crossroads with the taxi driving on the green.
After the collision, the ambulance hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passerby, who died at the scene of the accident.
driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured and locked in their vehicles and had to be freed from the emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another summoned emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
In close coordination with the public prosecutor's office in Bonn, the police are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, and Mourinho finds it uncomfortable
After the embarrassing end of the league Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is defeated 1-3. The way of the defeat might be worth talking about.
Typical was the scene in the 74th minute, in which recovered Marko Arnautovic scored 3-1 for West Ham, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside in Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders stopped and left Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a performance that had already been largely insufficient.
The mood at United ’ s urban rival Manchester City is very different at the moment.
Citizens, trained by Mourinho ’ s big rival Pep Guardiola, came to a 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the underdog's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, Sergio Agüero secured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the move to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer championship leader
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the league Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League 1-1 against Chelsea.
As in the Cup, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londoners.
The goal of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only goal of the game.
Shaqiri, who entered the field for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, missed the equalizer just after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his gauntlet.
After the Reds had started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, now the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table due to the draw in the league.
Like City, London ’ s Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, with whom Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a report of success against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
With nine minutes to go, Watford buxzed defenseman Craig Cathcart into Alex Iwobi ’ s goal unluckily, and just two minutes later Mesut Özil scored his third goal of the season.
Arsenal passed Watford with a fifth consecutive victory and now ranks 5th behind the big rival Tottenham. Wolverhampton, under Portuguese coach Espirito Santo, continues to make a strong impression.
The Wolves remained undefeated in the 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and occupy the 8th place.
VW ’ s Core Brand Missing: Paris Motor Show under the Sign of Diesel Debate
The Paris Motor Show is held every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and nevertheless ubiquitous: The Diesel scandal and the fight for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German auto companies also with the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showcasing their new products in the French capital from next week, together with competitors from all over the world.
The diesel does not really play a major role anymore.
The possible exchange- and retrofit in Germany offers for diesel owners, which are to be negotiated until then with the government in Berlin, but should still be an important issue at least behind the brilliant scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: Although the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes are here with their first purely electric models, among other things: The Ingolstadt model is due to be launched at the end of the year, and the Stuttgart-based EQC in 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is scheduled to start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3-series.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to automobile companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which is celebrating its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
A good one million visitors came in 2016.
At least 380 people were killed in the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged and there has been enormous damage.
After the tremors, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach for a party in the coastal town of Palu.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
But also numerous other communities are affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate a service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking with a team of motorcyclists.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged on Sunday to the motorcyclists.
After all, the closing service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motorized pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral care of the PS "strong two-wheeler".
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of each month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a worship service that was anything but usual.
Already from 10 o'clock the Boliden were lined up before the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the biker was the morning pint on the program and it was allowed with coffee and cake or even be strengthened with a hearty sausage Currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo Team were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, there.
The sermon was given by Father Dirk Grzegorek during the biker service.
Singer / songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes a rather poetic, calm note," says pastor Frank Schröder.
Also this was yesterday surely a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates great feast: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active at the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann also aroused great interest in Niemerg.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
From time to time Hartmann left Niemerg the field to the children and had the apples filled into the big funnel.
With a little muscle power the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they could also watch this important step in their work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed into shapes and encased in nets, Georg Hartmann stacked apple pieces on top of each other, layer by layer, looking a bit like chaff.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the final step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the farmer from Füchtorf also had ready filled specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the newest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good wine "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere the parents started talking, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the constructed bouncing castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited visitors to some of the entertaining games.
Also in the coming year the homeland association will offer a action day.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home will not be the place in the heart of the asparagus village.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: After all, it will be all about the milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season, bankruptcy: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and encouraged them.
However, there were not many positive things to see before at the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to come out as a team", said 96 Football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot".
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met to the connection, stand with two counters at the bottom and are in their current condition a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first season at home.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45. + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the German FA Cup winner, who moved into the midfield of the table after the successful dress rehearsal for the European League against Lazio Rome with seven points.
Croatia's Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in his debut almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hesse and Hanover's defense never get a grip on.
The long-stricken striker showed with his speed and assertiveness, why he is so valuable for the harmony.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, borrowed from Liverpool FC, also stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurt-based club, which started off energetically.
Header of Lucas Torró (17th) being deflected onto the net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back).
The lead for the hosts fell almost inevitably and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball into the penalty area after a warded off corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga match for the French second division player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt put down before the break.
This time Haller took care of his storm-partner Rebic, who skillfully fueled his way and 96 goalie Michael Esser didn ’ t give him a chance.
At halftime, Hanover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his team and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony played a bit more courageous to the front, but brilliant ideas stayed away until shortly before the end, when at least the connecting goal succeeded.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After about an hour Rebic started a solo and then played crosswise on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurter against overtaxed guests only show running, also Jovic hit one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it in front of millions at the opening of the 185.
Münchener Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy
Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on the 14th of September or on the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the Christ who was shot during the 30-year war and who, according to legend, was shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed from the bullet wound.
This resulted in a large pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the sanctuary stands, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite its importance for the parish in Geising, the divine service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and the church part of the Feast of the Cross ended with the final blessing.
For many years the catholic church choir invites then still to the secular part of the celebration into the catholic Pfarrheim.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food and a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish still offered guidance approximately around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid “Seger ” informed on behalf of the parish the visitors about the damage at front, roof, the sandstone work and windows as well as the lining up building measures, which will last still into the next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage has been identified more precisely and the individual tenders have been prepared more specifically.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased, but more has also been determined, which was only possible through inspection by means of scaffolding.
The pedestal plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before the winter and it is hoped that a good half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Danube Iller opens a new residence for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to its destination - all those present agreed on the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence hall of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader considered wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer's building of the U.S. Army was put to the test for residents with a handycap: "The house was getting old and no longer up-to-date in its furnishings," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
The Danube opens new residence in Iller
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the District of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned scope – both in terms of time and financially.
Also for it the managing director thanked him of the life assistance, Jürgen Heinz.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction method had not always been easy.
Nevertheless the planners and craftsmen had established with the many defaults a home, which let the inhabitants experience the liberty to be able to move also without strange assistance.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of social administration in the Swabian district, also commented similarly: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
The cosiness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: “The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer to be acquired in such a way in the today's situation ”.
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square metres, divided into three residential groups.
Proud is life assistance to managing director Heinz on the eleven full-time workers, who are all employed after tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the deputy SPD leader Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the discrimination of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unit.
We must not be satisfied with these differences ", said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag ".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked longer hours on average than people in West Germany, but were paid 15 percent less.
“Almost 30 years after German unification, I can ’ t explain that to anyone, ” said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one year old Pungsan Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has donated two North Korean hunting dogs to South Korean President Moon Jae In.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two about one year old dogs reached their recipient already on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to "make it easier for the animals to get used to it".
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
The two countries also agreed to compete jointly in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly apply to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria ’ s eventful history reflected in 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archives, takes a completely different view in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" (Picture Book) of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work in the field - that is the unofficial motto of the Grand Coalition working week that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not recently mantra-like evoked the "return to the material work".
This may have led many craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to ask the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and material work, but be that as it may.
When the Federal Government is ready to return to its task of governing, it should not be prevented from doing so by means of conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and disgrace of the last few weeks will possibly be shown on Monday.
In the evening the leaders of the governing parties meet for a coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the quarrels.
First, however, with the diesel retrofits and the Immigration Act are again conflict-ridden issues on the agenda.
CSU ’ s transport minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums lightly, while the SPD and CDU see manufacturers as being obliged to retrofit older diesel engines.
While in the diesel crisis over the weekend a rapprochement has become apparent, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned law on the immigration of skilled workers.
The SPD calls for a prospect of residence for rejected asylum seekers who work or undergo training.
The Union is firmly opposed to the 'change of track' from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another quarrel among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
Not equal and equal joined to the GroKo, but three partners with partially very different conceptions of society and priorities.
Controversy is good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse and sometimes conflicting interests will not progress.
But in order to be constructive, quarrel must not be blown up again for party tactical reasons into the question of being or not being.
It is still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - however always have the reality of life of humans in the view.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the track change question can be clarified pragmatically - and so regain confidence.
Above all, this is what the grassroots parties must fight for now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister targeted
Is it precisely the Minister for Employment who is violating the current service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" their members had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant Social Security Minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
Beate Hartinger's statement in the "Pilz" list of the Austrian parliament is met with astonishment by Daniela Holzinger - she is now bringing the matter to the parliament via an enquiry.
She assumed that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and did not want to announce any violations of the applicable service law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "absolve Hartinger from any suspicion."
Police break down a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning there has been digging on the main road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
This was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, which was specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant area to a few meters together with his guide in repeated use.
In addition, scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority discovered a soil anomaly in the area of the road in question.
For more than a year now, the Prosecutor and Criminal Investigation Court are working on the case.
Again and again a bicycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heikes body could have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Color Powder and Eggs: Riots in Barcelona before Catalonia ’ s Anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But even before that there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - On the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police broke out in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with, among other things, paint powder when they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3 000 officers of the National Police and Civil Guard units held a rally in honour of their colleagues who were at the polling stations last year in the referendum that was deemed illegal.
Violence also arose at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
The Catalan police have formed a chain to keep the separatist demonstrations and the central security forces separate, reported the Spanish media.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would then have tried by force to break through the police chain, throwing bags of paint and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people have been arrested and another 24 have been slightly injured, according to the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in U prison.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split scoreless
Red-and-white awls continues to tread in place.
Also with FC Gütersloh it was only enough to draw 0: 0.
In front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion they turned out to be helpless.
The first half was manageable from the entertainment factor.
Who wanted to get therefore rather a beer or a Bratwurst, could do this unconcerned.
There was no risk of missing a chance to score, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh ’ s Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - possibility had the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Team goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area border to a parade.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action consisted of an early change.
Forward Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change both teams decided to do something against the increasingly arising boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel shot from 18 meters just over the case and after one hour also the Gütersloher appeared for the first time offensively.
After Matthäus Wieckowicz ’ s conquest of the ballpark, the game went fast.
Nick Flock (62nd) "crowned" the counter attack over Sinan Aygün with a shot into the arms of RWA team goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball from the former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
Interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It caused - nothing.
The Ahlens did not achieve more than visual superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but even that didn ’ t bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive: "I like that we played to zero." But, unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, although our opponent had no desire to play here", stated RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively "everything rippled a bit" against a team that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not have the feeling that we could get a goal against ", said Daut.
To his regret, however, as a spectator one did not have the feeling that his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
This pleases Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, while the square was still a bit empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "It's so nice and sociable here, that's why we are here today", said one visitor.
Organizer of the party Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl, as always, with a good pinch of humor.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice for the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) became ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" insisted on entertaining the growing number of visitors musically in between.
It was so well received that at a late hour some folk songs were sung along.
"Simply great", said Marcel Kreimer happily.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to include the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is happy about the many active people with their booths, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually, there should not be such a thing as a blackboard", he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who worked at the booths and also included the other celebrations held in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful paint - something goes here.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took off the wreath with the help of the fire brigade and brought it to the winter quarters.
At many booths was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative with his scroll saw.
He had veneer work, coasters with Reckenfelder motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfelder beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought along by Maria ’ s Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth ’ s bush slippers.
The latter has yet another specialty.
Honey cake in a glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to grab it again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without the stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Graffiti with local political message: no successful advertisement for skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have hardly promoted the construction of a skate park in a conducive way.
At several places there are appropriate Schmierereien, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on inquiry of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" (skate park for Lengerich!) are emblazoned in large letters on signs at, among others, the Gempt ’ s Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign on the stairway to the Gempt ’ s bistro was discovered after the career choice fair on 19 September.
Since the short message at the time was apparently "only" left with an edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was back again, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skate park is built, its realisation should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the urban specialist area school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
Local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate parks for years.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the Council voted in favour of the fire station parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee voted unanimously in favour of the Gutenberg School site.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council will have the last word.
He assumes that a decision could be taken this year, so that if the vote is positive, construction could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations was the long-known shortage of staff in European air traffic control, for which there was no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots will take four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Throughout Europe, the market for fully trained pilots is empty.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that several aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal and state governments, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in Hamburg on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
“If you want to talk about extra work and overtime, that won ’ t be possible without us, ” explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the federally owned German air navigation service.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission ’ s guidelines for the pilots ’ misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air navigation service providers are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to press for regulations in Brussels that would "no longer shut down air traffic control".
Currently, the EU is agreed until 2024 and there are to fear further tightening.
The EU is subject to constant pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair's boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high cost of delays on the part of the airlines would lead to a rethink.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", said Maas.
The admission of 120 pilotage students per year over the next five years announced so far is just sufficient to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary personnel increase is not yet connected with it.
Thyssenkrupp ’ s Supervisory Board votes for corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to Thyssenkrupp ’ s interim head Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be headquartered in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There will be no additional staff cuts in addition to those already known in the administration.
After two resignations, the capital control panel has only eight heads.
This is opposed by ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, will bundle the business with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations by police officers and Catalan independence activists.
There have been two simultaneous demonstrations in Barcelona by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence activists, with violent clashes and numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6000 pro-independence activists.
The Catalan police had tried to keep the two protests apart with a large contingent.
According to the forces, pro-independence activists tried repeatedly to break through the security barrier.
They had attacked the officers with paint and bullets.
According to the information, there were also fights between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescue services, 24 people were injured.
The police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, had taken action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which had been banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil consider it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators found it a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they thrashed us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Breakdown of access to personal data of British ministers
A security hole in a mobile app has meant that the personal data of Conservative Tory MPs and ministers was temporarily available to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the breakdown was revealed the day before the Tory Party Congress in Birmingham.

Football: Juve Obispo coach praises top match: Ronaldos best game
The star Portuguese forward "played the best game that night together with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve, coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record holder's 3-1 (1-1) win over the SSC Napoli.
For the coach the dearly bought star was also without own goal the crucial man in the important match against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good in our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo ’ s three assists, Juve turned the game after the early delay by the goal of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and dropped the worst chaser for the time being.
The goal scorer, who was picked up by Real Madrid, first played for former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26. / 49.).
And after a corner header Ronaldo also prepared for the goal of defensive boss Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just had to push in just before the goal line.
“He gives many templates, ” praised the coach.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to be even better at serving him," demanded the coach.
Ronaldo has three on his account – best Juve ’ s scorer currently is Mandzukic with four goals.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million Euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in the series A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.
The second in the standings, coached by former Bavarian coach Carlo Mourinho, was not without chances against Turin.
But at the latest after the already warned Mario Rui (58th) had been dismissed, the top draw was decided.
The Portuguese had to take off after too hard a start against Paulo Dybala with yellow and red.
"We played well against a good Naples," the Turin coach commented.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has prevailed in Juve.
The professional who came from Liverpool FC played in all seven league games.
The middle-field player also played against Valencia in the Champions League, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had dropped the Turin team in the 2-0 victory and is closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly quirky performance rapper Kanye West attracted attention at the U.S. TV ’ s Saturday Night Live show at the weekend.
Among other things, his performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowning and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
Henceforth one may call him only "Ye", so the musician.
"The creature that used to be known as Kanye West", he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince when he gave up his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not a novelty.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most frequently used word in the Bible and there it means" you ", says the rapper.
Soccer: Bezirksliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar ’ s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more handy, we almost never put him in front of problems ". Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar shooting possibilities reads thin.
Grade times two chances to score in 90 minutes, thus rarely games can be positively arranged.
FC Bayern Munich: SC Hoetmar defeated SG Sendenhorst 0-2 (0-1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG, too, had only two options in the first round, but the first one was used by Maik Krause from an acute angle for the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great preparatory work by Krause he twisted freestanding.
The hosts had only a double chance when first Moritz Höne failed against goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the rebound Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
One trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red - Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests either (75th).
Only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line, the match was decided (81.).
"We had criticised ourselves hard before, but today it was different than in the last weeks", was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0-1 Krause (7 '), 0-2 Berheide (81').
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Soccer: Bezirksliga A2 Münster: Spectacular Soccer in Albachten: GW Albersloh defeated Concordia 3-4
"I don't know what to make of it," he wrestled for words.
"We didn't get access to them at all." With them he probably meant the wing-tongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all other greens, "whites" who stood out with a collective offensive drive.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheekily and pulling his players away from there, however, was the relief to note that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel of two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the league.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"That was by far our best performance of the season", he says.
"How we came back after 0-2, how we hold against one of the top teams of the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal".
All the more bitterly, he said, that we now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner brought the hosts into the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
For Fabian Fröhning (39.) he made the 2-0 on the left side.
We knew that, but you can't take out such a player completely.
"That was madness, what he did", Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own team managed to equalize: McGill ’ s free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia, and goaltender Hinkerohe through to the long goal line (45.).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who scored the equalizer (59th).
Then we went back and forth.
It was a crunchy, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized (69th).
Despite outnumbering Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia-hit (80th).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1-0 Zymner (24.), 2-0 Fröhning (39.), 2-1 McGill (45.), 2-2 McGill (59.), 3-2 Nübel (64.), 3-3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4-3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Red: Atalan (74. / Albachten).

Media: Whole Executive Committee of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire executive committee of Bundesliga side Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media unanimously referred to a joint letter from the Committee of the Saxons.

Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
It is good that he is gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure from Germany is as much of a relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish President visited Berlin and Cologne, and many people thought that he should not have been invited.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Protestant Academy of Tutzing is offering about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he will personally pick up the tolerance price in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff the term of office was too short: As Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Protestant Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn included him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep appearing at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic at the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective; on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is attending a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed: He wants to receive the "Tolerance Award" awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences up to the middle of 2019 are something special.
"The pension is not safe evenly!" stands in a conference title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria:" barbarism without limit ".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every humane idea ".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical transformation of work through digitalization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th
Some people expect more visitors to the direction of capitalism, others expect a tendency "from the extreme left to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 per cent a daughter of the Protestant regional church", said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "thus we are not to 100 per cent neutral".
Musical Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner presented herself with gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
She used the miniature guitar and mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes has his say right up to the end of the movement, and on the other hand he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies us in such a congenial and harmonious way that some might have wished for a solo.
This was also the case with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, namely in the way it suited the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes, if he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner would be of no use.
The pianoforte "solo" now demonstrates the same: What would have arisen from Mozart's composition if "the nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's "Moll" Symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and "bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, to the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not miss an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo to a concert in Wolbeck as well as in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Ladies' regional league: Ahlener SG keeps the white waistcoat against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, which alone marked ten goals.
"Actually I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn ’ t get a grip on that, ” said ASG ’ s coach, Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed about the many missed chances.
His team missed the concentration in the final this time.
The ASG therefore followed a gap almost to the end, was 11: 12 for the break and later 15: 18 (45.) behind.
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hostesses become decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed backspace Merle Klement on the far left, who then "extremely cleverly scored the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top match at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top match, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second league relegation VC Allbau Essen the Blue White won with 3: 1.
“That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked this out ", said a happy coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the crashed championship leader.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went with 25: 15 to the vice-champion of the previous year.
Essen has accepted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We kept them busy.
Our opponent hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set the BSV led already with 12: 8. “meal changed the acceptance to three-bar.
We could not keep the impact pressure.
Eating has sucked itself in, and we have been lulled a little ", so Münch further.
At 18: 17 for the first time the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the nose ahead.
Although Ostbevern defended against four set balls at 19: 24, the fifth attempt found its target.
"The game was now a class better," the trainer said on the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed with their serves to the fact that the BSV turned the tables in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly there."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13, the blues-and-white-passage brought four to their side with 25: 22.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had an excellent day.
Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch, Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the manner in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib ’ s mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left behind a shambles in the Germany-Turkish relationship that can only be brought together with difficulty," said TGD chairman Gökay Sofuoglu to the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides had missed the chance for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining the Muslims' affiliation to Germany side by side with German top politicians, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes", complained Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public "reinforced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally back Folktreff time.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Heimatverein Nottuln will be holding its fifth Nottulner Folk Meeting in the Kaminzimmer der Alten Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day it is then a year ago that we have performed for the first time a folk meeting.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would never have thought that our folk meeting would establish itself so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether storm Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always full.
"The programme at the next folk meeting is, as always, a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl Heinz Stevermüer, who invites his friends to Nottuln again and again.
Klaus Spellmeyer and his accordion have confirmed their participation in the first "Folktreffen birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he is on the road with an irish folk band.
The organizers of the Folktreff gladly remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten thrilled the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent it home with a catchy tune.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the Heimatverein.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to become actively involved is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but admission is already at 7 pm.
China approves proposed merger between Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step towards becoming the world ’ s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, announced Linde on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar merger still has to be approved in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
According to an insider, the chances of obtaining approval there had improved recently because Linde had agreed to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to be successful.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893, a fruit exhibition in the Kulmbach club house provided the last impulses for the foundation of the Kulmbach District Association for Horticulture and Landscaping, and exactly 125 years later it celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach Stadthalle.
Of course, its name was different at the time: it was named "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
Also the purpose of the orchard association differed from today's work - it was actually purely about the fruit growing, about flowers and horticulture nobody thought at that time yet.
“At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites ”, explained district home caretaker Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees were to line trunk roads, so-called industrial gardens were laid out at schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But that is far from exhausting the spectrum.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as large a role as the transfer of knowledge, a healthy nutrition and the youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer youth group "Moles" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are on stage.
“The youth work is urgently necessary particularly in the digital age ”, said the circle chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed, how important experiences in nature are for the life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect as much joy with smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should be located is decided by the district association", added District Administrator Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The county association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a genuine request of the many horticultural associations in the district left also circle managing director and technical adviser Friedhelm Haun no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Formerly everything came from the garden, for the winter it was rustled.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and living garden.
"Nature endures, it was there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," said the expert for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to slacken, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
In addition it belongs also to welcome the new citizens in our associations, supplemented the president of the Bavarian regional organization, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe that to our children and grandchildren", Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower-blowers of the music association Thurnau.

Canada ’ s Foreign Minister Releases UN Speech to Priority Talks in Nafta
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity on NAFTA: it is giving both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking to the UN General Assembly today, the Minister will only speak on Monday, spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she said, she was focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
The Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs, Ildefonso Guajardo, said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the USA would have 48 hours to reach agreement if Canada really wanted to accede to the trade agreement already concluded between its country and the USA.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the NAFTA regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be brought to a conclusion, Trump ’ s government wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report in the daily "O Globo", the right-wing extremist former military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make any public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked in the street at an election rally in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the former military.
In the social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro ’ s racist and women-despising statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests mingled with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the metropolis of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in surveys so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but now presents itself as an anti-regime candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a run-off election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully, no matter who he fights against.
Bolsonaro is known for his incitement against homosexuals and blacks, and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964 to 1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time, he said that supporters of Lula ’ s Left Workers ’ Party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, announced his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen ’ s website.
At his deathbed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen became known with the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band disbanded in 1978, Larsen was a successful solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The Prime Minister also recalled that the monarchy ’ s opponent, Larsen, appeared on the occasion of the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: noise level at pneumatic hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live musician experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three bands friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no sign of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly inspire the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" -Rocknacht visibly.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening also with newest, unknown pieces from own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage there is dancing to the harmonious and powerful interaction of the band.
Although "Encore" calls are not to be missed, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not just hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change of melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the complex songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, since its founding in 2005, gained a special reputation.
Full of agility the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" has special stage experience with their performances before a very large audience - most recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets in interaction with the band in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo to the sound, which is even more highly controlled than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume is genre-conditioned at such a hard rock concert of course to: At the "Mint Mosquito" - Rocknacht, according to information from the console team at the three-part concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 Decibels.
This is at the pneumatic hammer level, but is still clearly below the levels of the "Wacken" Fesitval, to which "The Ignition" refers on their website.
The Ahlener audience doesn ’ t need deafening 120 decibels in jet engine volume as usual at the annual metal meeting in the north of the republic.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking pace have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
“Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the strength of a tiger ”, can say all three groups, admittedly in the figurative sense, at the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in a glider accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim / Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in misfortune.
There was a fatal accident near Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider crashed on the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the student pilot was alone on board - the plane is said to be a one-seater.
At the time of the accident, the plane was already on its approach to land.
The crash site is not far from a marquee on the airport site.
But since this weekend an Oktoberfest takes place.
Mülheim / Essen airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr cities and directly at the entrance to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride on offer at major events at the Messe Essen or the Gruga ’ s Hall in Essen.
Trump Adores Kim: "And Then We Fall In Love"
It is no secret that, despite the nuclear crisis, North Korea ’ s President Kim is well disposed.
Now, however, Trump has made a veritable declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US President has pledged himself to a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a long-distance relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in public on Saturday.
In front of supporters in West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the Pyongyang ruling dynasty, even though it turns out to be a rather tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he was tough, and things went back and forth between us, ” Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim ’ s announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even if critics see little more than lip service behind it.
Trump ’ s nickname for Kim, the US president seemed well aware that the affection for the “Rocket Man, ” notorious for his martial threatening gestures, might not be to everyone ’ s liking.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of this during his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he didn ’ t care much, Trump explained, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: “I ’ ve always told you it ’ s so easy to be presidential. ”
But then there wouldn ’ t be 10,000 people out there in this bulging arena, we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is well visited, atmospheric and full of sunshine: Baesweiler's city centre has cleaned up on Sunday with a lot of variety and a good dash of Oktoberfest flair.
For the first time the Oktoberfest took place not only in the marquee at the fire tower, but was extended by the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone to point out their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July, risking their lives, and had distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said one man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe.
According to his own statement, he put himself in mortal danger with the video.
One of his comrades was beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back home this year with the help of the programme, said IOM ’ s spokesperson in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
From a cry for help by mobile phone, but video he had not heard.
International organisations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.

Around 4: 50 p.m. the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the anteroom of the first floor, she saw a man who fled immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who started the investigation.
Whether things or money were stolen cannot be said yet.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75 Years old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a wooded area in Central Franconia, after he had stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon, rescue workers discovered the car by chance not far from a pasture and freed the missing person since Tuesday evening, the police announced on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reported to be in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip with his jeep across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
In his conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Cologne NRW ’ s Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This applies above all to waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite."
According to his own statements, Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan has again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan traveled after the conversation on to the opening of the Ditib ’ s mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their interlocutors - not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
Whereas US President Trump never tires of stressing the successes of negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Secretary of State Ri calls for a concession from Washington.
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The recent stalemate comes because the US is relying on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence building," Ri said in New York.
Under these circumstances, disarmament was unthinkable for North Korea.
“Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way for us to be the first to disarm ourselves, ” the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who do not know us".
To build confidence, however, Ri emphasized that his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear testing facility.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, criticised the Minister.
Last year alone, because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
In recent days, US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have pressed the United Nations for strict compliance with the sanctions.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong-un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is due to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea ’ s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the House of Open Door HoT got nothing of it: White blankets and floral decoration on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving.
The youth of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the congregation, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the manager of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators full of food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: A power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of order, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to make it on their own", said Westbuer.
And so everyone joined in.
The result was impressive, the guests were thrilled.
“Cooks couldn ’ t do it any better, ” praised a visitor, impressed, while Hokkaido ’ s pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, meat loaf or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized Father Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW state board of Tafel
Out of frustration with criticism from his own ranks, the chief of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, gave up his position in the regional association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Tafel had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice Chief of the NRW, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many have fallen into my back.
The head of the North Rhine-Westphalia regional association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding for the decision of his long-standing deputy to dpa.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - people have commented who did not know exactly why the Essener Tafel is doing this".
Sartor is however still active for the Essener table - “six days the week, there nothing changes ”, so Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "Welt am Sonntag" again criticism of colleagues from other boards.
One should not follow the approach "without us the people in the city starve to death".
It is the task of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The man from Essen did not participate in a congress of the plaques on Friday in Berlin.
"They tell me too much sweet scrub," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis, which also criticized me at that time.
SF Lorch verspielen 2: 0 Gmünder Tagespost
Fußball, Bezirksliga Lorch verliert gegen Neuler 2: 3 - TV Heuchlingen siegt in Kirchheim nach Rückstand - Bettringen schlägt Lauchheim klar.
With 2: 0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV newcomer - in the end it was 2: 3 and the disappointment with the sport friends was big.

Gladbach playful two times lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach still has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2: 2 the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1-0).
(sda) In the first five league games Schalke has four times manoeuvred into the sidelines with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco showed again the strength with which they had occupied the first place behind the Bavarians last season.
Alessandro Schöpf brought the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preparations of Yevgeni Konoplyanka by head in the lead, in the consequence the hosts conserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive achievement.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia welcomes Dortmund from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had earned a 0-2 deficit against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came in the second half to the 4-2 victory.
Jacob ’ s Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalized with a doublet within four minutes, while Paco Alcacer, substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, crowned the performance improvement after the break with another doublet in the final phase (86th / 94th).
The first win was also scored by VfB Stuttgart.
Against that because of a yellow red card against Milos Veljkovic decimated already before the break Werder Bremen had to fear the Stuttgart meanwhile.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron “Robert Zieler ” fabricated a curious interjection of“ own goal ”, which helped the guests to equalize in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led VfB to victory for the first time.
In Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not an unsuccessful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
With the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, the Gladbacher lost a lead twice, ultimately played 2-2 and are still waiting since 2003 for an away win in VW.
Renato Steffen with his second Bundesliga player was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1-1 equalization.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the 20-metre shot from Aargau, just as in the second counter-attack after one hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchasing team from OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven laps Gladbach takes 4th place.
Within 40 minutes the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred itself against VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a counterattack from Stuttgart, which the former Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season. After 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to attack his team: The 23-year-old Serb lost to Daniel Didavi Yellow after a knock-out against Red.
Though Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron ܢ Robert Zieler brought Bremen back into the game by a curious interjection of own goal (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgart players back onto the road of victory.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0 sovereign for itself.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens brought the home team on track with foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens vote today on whether their country ’ s name should be changed to Northern Macedonia.
A “yes ” vote could resolve the almost three-decade-old conflict with neighboring Greece.
Because of its eponymous northern province, Athens had insisted on a change of name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
Voters thus also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that if the referendum ended in a positive way, the country could quickly become a member of NATO.
Syrians imprisoned in Uzbekistan.
Refugee attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and injured them severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted on Friday against 22 Clock in the escape lane in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they approached the accused person, who attacked passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officials.
A short time later, it turned out that the suspect had recently knocked three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
In addition, he had trampled the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were partly seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for reasons still unknown ”, as the police called it.
He was taken to hospital and supervised throughout the treatment.
Social Democratic Party politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two got married in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is budgetary spokesman for the SPD in the Bundestag and one of the spokespersons for the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a sensation with a speech on 30 June 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski" moment, he said, alluding to the accidental proclamation of the GDR by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as in the adoption law.
Day of garden: 400 meters cut hedge
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Civic Association Children's Home and the Society for Leprosy Studies.
For about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, about twelve supporters went to work.
"We do this in order to reduce costs", declared the chairman of the civic association Walter Schröer.
And a lot has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is only a form cut now.
This is because the hedge has already been shorn in the spring.
The breakfast that always follows the work also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold in the Canoe Slalom
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the end of the World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday at the Olympic track.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here at the facility and everything was fine today, "said the Olympic third from London 2012.
At the finish he threw his paddle away with joy and raised both arms in the air - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
At least he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting reports the first break-in attempt of this autumn into a single family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to make use of that again.
Yesterday, the Gauting police reported the first attempted break-in this autumn.
The fact that it remained with the attempt at the single family house at the Königswieser road is to be owed to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators lent a hand on Friday shortly before 8pm.
The burglars sensed that the residents were not at home.
But the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
bankruptcy at Hertha: caught up by reality: Bavaria against Ajax demanded
The predicate is unbeatable: FC Bayern wants to "not put up with" the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim result for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dent under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase to the bigger autumn low for the residents of Munich.
"A week ago you had the impression that we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us a bit ", Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions' League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are stepping on the gas on Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year abroad no own goal scored, as at the same time of the preseason two compulsory games in series without victory, the championship lead in the soccer Bundesliga initially to Borussia Dortmund lost.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as it was at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at the 1: 1 with his run-intensive man, the man, the tactics and the Berliners by their playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seemingly overpowering Bavarians are yet to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not put up with it and that we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac emphasized.
Apart from that, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city and merely blamed his first defeat as a Munich coach on the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless let the first intermediate result of his term of office be positive - otherwise the tone will probably intensify.
So Kovac did not undertake any extraordinary measures before the second regatta after the 2-0 at Benfica Lissabon.
After the free day on Sunday begins as planned the short preparation for the second preliminary round play against Ajax, which had defeated AEK Athens likewise sovereignly with 3: 0 to the prelude.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Just like after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The right defender acted in the role as an admonisher.
“I don ’ t think that ’ s all bad luck, we have to work hard again because we don ’ t make the many chances and make the mistakes in the back, ” the 23-year-old stressed shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of last season, the Bavarians were even five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a one-point advantage.
And so, with a wink, Kimmich assessed positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's already good", said the international.
For the league it is already good.
German Football Association (DFB) Boss in Line of Fire: Oezil Causa: Sharp Attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With heavy reproaches the Turkish president Erdogan denounces an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB-President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for sovereignty of interpretation in the duration of the dispute Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib ’ s mosque in Cologne, the DFB ’ s boss defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning Grindel, who had been attacked sharply by Özil himself, announced the consequences of the case at the ZDF "Sports Studio" in Mainz.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the teams - that such a thing does not happen again," said the 57 "year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again declared that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had denounced with sharp words a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they let themselves be photographed with me in England, "said Erdogan on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as its president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have advanced to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan ’ s statement that, in contrast to Özil, Gündogan felt “reasonably treated by the DFB ” after the FIFA World Cup, which had begun with pictures of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
I have always said that we should have defended Mesut more.
But he also doesn't see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional Integration Officer is to be appointed.
“If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says: ‘ The issue is important, we have to take care of it ’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work, ” said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the office of DFB president next year.
“I do my job and try to do it as well as I can, ” Grindel said.

Coburg / Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75 year old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 clock.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the area Lauterer height.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
But it did not come to an exchange of personnel, because the 75 Years old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone call about a car driver who had strayed from the road and driven against a guard post.
When asked, the man did not want to see a local police force and then left.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has lost his way in the place where he has lived for decades and rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police could find and stop him.

Moorbrand in Meppen: Still nearly 1000 firefighters in use.
Approximately four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 firefighters are still engaged in the firefighting work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop steadily, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of volunteers is planned, it is said.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire was discovered and put out.
Last week, the disaster that had been declared just over a week earlier on 21 September was lifted because it was feared that the flames would endanger neighbouring forests and settlements through wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was said that the fire would no longer spread to neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1500 volunteers tried to get the major fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus engineers.
The smoke trail of the peat fire was temporarily pulled up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
Social Democratic Party politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the marriage came into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two got married in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
When we get married, it is right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is budgetary spokesman for the SPD in the Bundestag and one of the spokespersons for the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a sensation with a speech on 30 June 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski" moment, he said, alluding to the accidental proclamation of the GDR by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as in the adoption law.
New names referendum started in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should in future be called North Macedonia.
Because of its northern province of the same name, neighboring Greece exists.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote 'yes', they will also give the go-ahead for the western integration of their country.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Swisstransplant emphasises that the new procedure does not change the fact that organs may only be removed with express consent.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with express consent, as in Germany, emphasises Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor ID card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of the cases a map is found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In over 60 per cent of the discussions the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You must then make a proxy decision in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to save data to the possible organ donation on the health insurance map, like the spokeswoman of the Federal center for health clearing-up, Marita peoples to Albert say.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn spoke out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
Under his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or her relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in mental arithmetic.
At the weekend in Wolfsburg he won against 39 competitors.
This was reported by Martina Flamme, Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
Sixteen-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as principal arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks include: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greeting was already two years ago as then 14 Years old in Bielefeld participated.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or child prodigy organizers Laue can do little.
"Mental calculation can be trained," he said.
Many participants practised for several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even computing competitions in stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, drawing square roots from six-digit numbers.
In versatility computing, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans also have a good chance, said the main referee.
Otherwise Asians are often in the advantage, because there already in the early childhood mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.

Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the west next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week – it could snow down to around 1,000 metres in narrow valleys at high intensity, they said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow are expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions therefore become wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start annual buckling care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to begin annual buckling care on Monday.
The "green ramparts", which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of this forest-poor federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and undergrowth hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are a "forest substitute" and the last retreat for many animals and plants.
As corridors, Knicks connect scattered habitats over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the order of King Christian VI of Denmark in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field barriers and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to this time: by "bending" the branches, the dense, interwoven demarcations could develop.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, creating an image of a woody, diverse landscape.
According to data of the NABU they are used meanwhile by approximately 7000 types of animal as replacement habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in a kilometre of bend and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is cared for appropriately in winter.
Otherwise it atrophies to a light row of trees, which in addition to biodiversity also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, buckling care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on the spot
In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Have you been there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately started on my way back to Sulawesi.
Since I arrived on Sunday morning, because I still had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Also our office of "World Vision" is destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people of Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and petrol.
The civil service has been shut down completely and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are sometimes walking around freely and it is difficult to find them.
Many bodies are still lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information flow on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who they do not know if they live or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal within reach.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in turbo speed
Time is extremely short and the number of interrogations planned is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbo speed, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial on coercion charges.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline until Friday for investigators to investigate alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama about Kavanaugh ’ s appeal, accompanied by a Kulturkampf, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer unleashed angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the ultra-conservative judge at the US Supreme Court.
The Republican majority seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, suddenly declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the heavy reproaches on Thursday as "shit", initially refrained from further attacks against the women and spoke, on the contrary, of "happiness in disguise".
This would remove any remaining doubts, he said.
Later, at a rally, Trump attacked the Democrats for opposing Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy. ”
Trump Orders FBI to Investigate Kavanaugh Case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators.
A government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip," he said.
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar installed in a "civilian vehicle" by the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1.
This is also where the Bundesschulzentrum is located.
The municipality also operates several permanently installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after winning against Mainz: Fear was felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
Nevertheless also the factor time played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty box ", said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
After all, the royal blue had succeeded in bringing the close 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under agreement.
In fact, it could have been otherwise.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11th had given certainty to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "All in all, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing." With increasing duration of the game, obviously the head played more and more a role.
Schöpf no Header Monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me", said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that".
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew more and more.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had no small part in it with his header shot: "I am actually the worst header player in the team."
But in the end only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start powerfully in the initial phase and make a firework out of it", said Schalkes head coach.
Victory was important.
Finally we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest deficiency of the afternoon: Royal blue missed it, rather to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice 59. / 72., or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a tremor victory," said Tedesco: "One has already felt the fear a bit".
I am therefore pleased that we have won.
Therefore he was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal valley observed a fire on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El öhe Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion on an equal footing
In front of them stands the author, Professor Aladin El cle Mafaalani.
Once again he accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in the organization of the evening.
ElMafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and one or two jokes, he brings one of the most conflicting themes closer to the audience: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts increasingly arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at a table, at the table the first generation of migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether one places oneself on the right or on the left, but rather: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
In the beginning rather restrained, then ever more brisk the discussion round starts.
And we need to speak.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two female teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with pupils.
El.Mafaalani stands in front, not on the stage, a symbol of the discussion: It is on eye level.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is, can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still listened to the guests ’ questions and in the foyer there was intensive further discussion of prepared Kurdish specialities.

How Schalkes Naldo succeeds "big sport" also on the bench
Not in the starting line-up for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not been in Schalke's starting line-up for the third time in a row, but had been on the replacement bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two-meter tall Brazilian had talked his frustration out of his soul.
But when after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 the Schalke players gathered in the middle circle as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his pros, the 36 year old, whom everyone simply calls Naldo, intervened and said: "We have to thank, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," later said Tedesco about the reaction of his vice captain, who had no grudges despite his renewed reservist existence.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalke player last season, knows that he actually didn't get on the siding with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him this
"It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you in all honesty," Tedesco said of the moment when he had told Naldo that he was not in the starting line-up.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it is always about the matter, it is about the association ", Tedesco justified the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breath at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation that Naldo has recently caught.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself an exemplary team player on the bench as well.
In August, the mood in Austria ’ s industry continued to slide faster than in the eurozone.
At 46.7 points, the Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at 37%.
In spite of this, Austria has the third-best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit ’ s Institute announced on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the PMI of the Euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50 point mark indicating growth for the 13th consecutive month.
Only Ireland ’ s industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks brought up the rear (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the sentiment barometer did decline, but at a slower pace than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, the highest level since March.
"The slight slowdown may mean that the worst is over," said Markit, economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one growth brake - at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell at a rate not seen since November 2011.
Companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than was initially assumed.
The sentiment barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are recorded.
