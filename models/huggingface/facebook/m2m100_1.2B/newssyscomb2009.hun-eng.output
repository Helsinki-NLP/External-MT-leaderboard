Right-wing populists win in Austria with 29 percent
The significant weakening of the two parties in the previous big coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties were brought by the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously shaken, suffered strong losses.
On the other hand, the President of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Jörg Haider, is preparing for a victorious return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the most powerful party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the votes, but lost 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last election in 2006.
Even worse was the situation for the ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results ever achieved by both major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the People’s Party, which led to early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the start of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People’s Party had a significant advantage over the SPÖ, according to polls.
Voters, however, were apparently punished for letting the government fail.
In the early reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of party chairman Wilhelm Molterer and current deputy chancellor.
Observers expect this to take place at the extraordinary meeting of the party’s leadership on Monday.
This development would likely facilitate the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. the renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
Given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties – the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) previously received 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ received eleven percent of the votes – however, the Social Democrats expressed their fears of a recurrence of the year 1999 when the People’s Party agreed to joint governance with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, replacing it with the BZÖ in 2005), which even prompted sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party, and I assume he can return to Vienna in national politics, obviously expects this solution.
The Greens also entered parliament, but lost some popularity and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties surpassed the four-percent threshold and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may be cold
If it fails to solve the problem of the Czech scientists who have been charged with illegal bats harvesting, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that there could be some cooling in the Czech-India relations.
He said this after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee in New York.
"If this is not resolved, then yes, there would be some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on Czech incentive.
Mukherjee said after the hearing that the executive might find it difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he noted that in the case of Petr Švácha, who has been released from charges and has been fined, the central government can negotiate with the local authorities of Darjeeling, whose legislation the matter falls within.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
However, for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
He could then apply for release on bail and could freely wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed similarly during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to dismiss him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide the convicted with "competent legal assistance," the Indian minister said.
However, he said that the Indian side already provides them with such assistance.
“Our primary interest is to maintain the best relationships with India with many years of tradition.
This is recognized by the Indians,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We consider it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists,” he said.
Asked whether the Indian side had made a promise to deal with the matter, the minister failed to answer.
“I’ve already received a lot of promises,” he noted.
Czech judges in the battle for the seabed
Access the wall-based electronic map that shows Australia and neighboring maritime areas.
It is not a continent, but a point in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and with it the neighbouring seabed.
At the same time, the area is as large as the continent itself,” says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who belongs to the United Nations Ocean and Sea Law Division’s 30-member team.
His boss, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which he sometimes complements.
There is enthusiasm and enthusiasm here.
The ocean floor is rich in natural resources, covering a world that is hardly known.
Petroleum, ore and other minerals can be used here, but there are also unknown living organisms that may be key to the development of cancer medicines, for example.
Larger than land
Coastal states are now intensely seeking new underwater areas.
The United Nations treaty on human rights was signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is primarily the area of the so-called continental platform, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the coasts of a given country.
Such a country has an exclusive right under the Convention on all the resources of the continental plateau.
Simply put, the continental platform is the part of the seabed and the layer below which is the natural continuation of the submarine continent.
The boundaries of the coastal sea, often 200 nautical miles, also extend beyond the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission for the Designation of the External Borders of the Continental Plate should be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Commission has so far examined five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
In the world, the recent success of Australia has echoed, being the first to significantly expand its underwater country.
But New Zealand also won - the sea floor area granted to it by the commission is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times the size of the country's territory.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits resulting from the future use of the seabed are hoped to be invaluable.
Other countries are also continuously submitting applications.
They may do so within ten years from the date of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental foothold ends, begins the ocean floor area declared by the Convention as the “common heritage of humanity.”
No country has an exclusive status.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
“The seabed, however, is not Klondike,” says exaggerated director Mikulka, adding that “some of its territories are legally clearly delimited and their regimes are contractually fixed.”
Czechs in the Pacific
The sea floor is now part of the Czech Republic.
This is shared with other countries of the former Eastern Block within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, this organization, like investors in some other countries, was awarded the status of “pioneer investor”.
It is eligible to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of underwater copy of the Tatra.
"This can be mined in a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic minerals containing nickel, resin, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, gives another concrete example.
With a potato or a little fantasy, it reminds you of a pergament with magic words that bring Gollum to life.
German Special Forces to Release Hostages
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - and experts have arrived.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
The release of the 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt is becoming more and more detailed.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
In addition to specialists from the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the German Federal Police Air Force, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts from the German Technical Service were also on the scene.
Ministry spokesmen said on Monday night that German forces were not needed, however, as the hostages let their prisoners run and then fled when they recognized signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany to involve it as a support force on the ground.
“Fortunately, this has not happened,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
A group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts were abducted in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in the southern desert area of Egypt, the hostages were carried to and from the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has so far remained unclear, as are the details of the release of the hostages or the possible ransom payments.
The rescued arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not disclose the details of his release.
It has not yet been announced when he will return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, the five tourists and special forces on the Airbus plane of the German Air Force will arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan.
The U.S. House of Representatives has approved the $700 billion bailout plan for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones is falling.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout plan with 227 votes to 206.
Despite calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program aimed at curbing the chaos in the financial markets did not get a majority.
Supporters have desperately tried to convince critics of the need for the $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, a Democratic party negotiator, has called on MPs to support the plan, even if it is unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
The Dow Jones fell by more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
Investors are worried that the bailout plan will fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote to then fall again after a failure was revealed.
Experts anticipate further turbulence in the international financial markets.
The bill requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Directors are registering more and more reservations.
It is a good winter for German tour operators.
According to one study, the traffic of passport bookings for the following months has increased significantly compared to the previous year – more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the German tourism preference has not slowed down, according to the study.
In the winter season, travel agencies registered a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations in the autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was roughly 11 percent higher than in October 2007, DRV.
These results are based on data from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account travel booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the U.S. was especially sought, DRV said.
The number of reservations has increased by a third.
Germany’s most popular destinations are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local landscapes.
They were mostly sought after organized journeys,” said Klaus Laepple, president of DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, in the case of organized trips, the costs are “better calculated for passengers than for individually organized trips.”
Passengers can save money with, among other things, pre-booking discounts or all-inclusive deals, Laepple added.
The booking rate during the summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to register a turnover increase again compared to the previous year – although another study found fewer German tourists to travel compared to the previous year.
The first Oktoberfest
Repeated ballermann hits, litre bars of beer and design dirndlits wearing celebrities.
Departure to Wiesn.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don’t really resemble each other.
She is a blonde, a TV presenter, and wears a tailor-made dirndlit.
My hair is dark, I’m a student, and I’ve bought my clothes in the turquoise.
But one thing connects us: We’re only three minutes away at Wiesnen, we’re already being attacked by photographers and filled up with their memory cards – very pleasing, and all this on my first visit to Wiesnen.
This is how we can make friends.
It seems that the cheap dirndli fulfills its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist north of the white sausage equator, my sense of comfort is still limited by popular wear.
But when we get to Theresienwiese, it’s not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears dirndlits or leather trousers; no one looks flashy or embarrassing - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndli veil.
A woman in Munich reminds me that I wrongly attached the envelope: "Binded to the left, you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, in the right, a widow on the back."
I secretly crossed the mask from the back to the left.
“That’s fine,” he says and laughs.
Others are less upset about fine flirting techniques and wear a simple slickboard with the inscription “I’m too drunk to dress up” and unwantedly show their naked back.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob and also visited the Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic, extending the “aaaaa” for a long time.
He tells me all this after he got rid of the contents of his previously drunk barrel.
Directly next to one of the fireplaces that everyone sees as a rubbish bowl.
Bob is therefore one of the infamous “forbidden urineers.”
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 p.m. the rescue team will walk through the scene and take care of the poor.
Patient caregivers always emerge in teams - they carry a covered bed from tent to tent in four at the same time.
It works like most Wiesn visitors do: Arrival empty, departure plugged.
Who is lying underneath the cage is unknown.
“These are the ones who are completely ready,” one of the sanitary practitioners cried out to me on my question, and then in the film.
Police have named the victim.
Police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
Brentwood resident Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road, was injured on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road.
He was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of careless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey's Expanding Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers were burning with the desire to penetrate deep into the Turkish backland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least the books write that.
The building surrounds the ends of the perrons, with one tower at each front corner, and looks like some German countryside town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly shattered.
However, when you look at the inside of the bulldozer, it is obvious how large-scale the business had this western gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the “later future” of conquests, sought to realize its ambitions of occupying the Middle East using this railway from Damascus through Baghdad to today’s Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station was no better.
In 1917, an ammunition train exploded and destroyed the beautifully designed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was an act of sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed and has gone well beyond history.
At the same time, today, as a railway gateway to Anatolia and the entire Eastern region – at least in a symbolic sense – it serves as Turkey’s expanding diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, with Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of darkness, which at the time gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, The Night Mail - I arrived in the Turkish capital.
However, the AKP with well-known Islamic roots represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specially designed for this purpose - which stands in a developing suburban neighborhood, between semi-finished shopping centers and cafes. In the latter, dressed middle managers - both men and women - meet to do business early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a right-to-middle-minded politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a dress, a tie, and I’m sure he even had a Blackberry with him.
"The party's foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has disrupted the order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated.
He had to turn east and west at the same time.
He could not choose between the two.
It had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that he will be forced to vote sooner or later?" I asked.
“Turkey never wanted to face a choice.”
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke with repeated almost automatically: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea benefit Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
As if they wanted to convey the message that, in a translated sense, along with Turkey, the whole of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those railways that go east.
When I was again at the station of Hydarpasha, after another mostly awake night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the reconstruction of this magnificent building 100 years ago.
They would be surprised to learn that Europe’s Middle Eastern ambitions are now largely in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited in the harbour for the ferry to take you back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe" at that time.
At the time, at least there was no question which continent would claim to this exciting country.
Memorable Journeys: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as the Guildford Music Director, Vernon "Tod" Handley (nekrologist, September 11) has been leading the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the district, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have been included, but when Proteus sang its final in 1979 – many of us were in our late 20s – we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological transformator) was consistent with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any cottage they were put in front of him - be it the madrigal or a Messiaen piece; without an escort, or with a grand orchestral escort.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and it was thanks to a man whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He always said, “The composer knows what he wants.
Everything is in the box.
So sing it!”
His karma-mastery technique was always perfectly comprehensible and accurate, but it was never dictatorial or exaggerated.
No matter what the music level was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If there ever was a leader who was supposed to become a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I have written about more than 100 of his concerts over the past forty years, but it has never disappointed me, and often inspired me.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated the leaders who, in his words, simply “galoped around the world with one or two well-known bandits.”
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your necrologist William Woodruff (September 25), “He continued his studies of economic history at Oxford in 1946 and became a fellow at the Houblon-Norman Research Institute in 1950... while continuing to prepare for a bachelor’s degree, a master’s degree and a PhD.”
This comes from the authors’ notes of Woodruff’s work “Beyond Nab End,” but it’s wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economics at the University of Nottingham, and in the meantime, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, which he subsequently published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he actually stayed in the U.S. with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It’s unclear why Woodruff made this period of his career so beautiful.
J. Vicente Resino in the Wisdom
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and life" because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are impressive.
The simplicity and strength that comes from them, as well as the respect for the people in the photos, caught my attention.
This exhibition is inspired by emotions.
Resino was able to capture the magical moments.”
Record sales for Honda
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz.
It is true that the passenger compartment of the predecessor was already quite large, but the interior design of the new model is even more spacious.
All this is coupled with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar in appearance to its predecessor, a number of internal changes have been made to it.
These include innovative designs, a new body, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we move on to a detailed description of the new model, we must say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the launch of the first generation.
So first of all, we can say that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Jazz is less well-known in Europe, but it breaks sales records in other markets.
Japan, for example, was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost one million pieces of jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with half a million units sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
This means that while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz in 2007, it is projected to sell 100,000 vehicles by 2009, resulting in a 17% growth in the European market.
Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz cars in Spain since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
For the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units over the course of a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly ease Honda’s decline in traffic in Spain.
The company expects to sell 22,000 units by the end of this year, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, or a 16% decrease.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, rising from 1.6 percent last year to 1.8 percent.
I also want to increase this percentage to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to this with the introduction of a new model.
It would be the Insight, a five-door and compact-sized 4370mm-long hybrid of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units annually worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s market share would be in the United States, while the remaining share would be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is due in the first months of the year, following the official launch in Valencia scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in all respects.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimeters wider) and the axle distance has been increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to the size, the passenger space has also become wider.
The larger interior is guaranteed, on the one hand, by the new body and, on the other hand, by the fuel tank located in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total luggage capacity of the so-called double-floor luggage compartment has increased to 399 liters, which is 19 liters more than the first generation.
In addition to this, the above-mentioned sizes apply to the 1.4 engine model, as the luggage compartment of the 1.2 Honda Jazz is 379 liters.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as the rear LED lights or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as the easier accessibility of the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors for the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared with the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation of Jazz engines are also new.
At the start of its sale, this small model is available with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre engines.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, both engines consume more energy than the previous model, with lower carbon emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while delivering outstanding performance in all respects.
The 1.2 litre power supply has a power of 90 hp at a speed of 6000 and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at a speed of 4900.
This engine - which in the previous Jazz was 78 horsepower - consumes 5.3 liters and has 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
And the other engine, which produced 83 horsepower than the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The “Collision Vehicle”
For the development of accident-prevention technologies, Nissan this time drew inspiration from nature, precisely from the world of bees, for its new invention.
A Japanese company has developed a robot that can avoid accidents by imitating bees.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technology Center in collaboration with Tokyo University’s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center in Japan have built this small robot.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Head of Technology Public Relations and Research & Development, defines the BR23C as a further extension of Nissan’s four-layer safety cover.
The robot increases the collision avoidance capability of the company’s products.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cover.
However, much more important than this is the role of the complex eye of the uterus, with which it can see at angles of more than 300 degrees in all directions.
To copy the function of the complex eye, the engineers designed a so-called Laser Range Finder.
In front of the BR23C, the instrument identifies obstacles within a 180-degree range of up to 2 meters, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to avoid a collision.
As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot imitates the movements of the uterus and immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid collision.
The system is most distinguished from the currently available instruments by the fact that in this case the avoidance maneuver takes place completely automatically.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the circumventing maneuver cannot be directed up or down, nor can it be diagonal, it can only move in two dimensions and only in the direction of the reversibility of the wheels, that is, not in an infinite direction and way as is the case with bees.
That’s why Nissan used a rotation function in the robot in addition to acceleration and slowing down to avoid collisions.
“This structure only needs to process the data every few seconds and respond to it.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so it can work without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
It may sound surprising, but it’s not really gigabytes, but we’re not even talking about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which Nissan estimates could be used in mass-production vehicles within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, additional applications could include integrating the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to get the car to its final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgage
We must acknowledge that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of cash to invest, is not lacking in common sense.
In the wake of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from falling into the rubble of questionable mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the “bad credit hotel” ... that is, the hotel of the galibs.
The depiction of the accommodation and especially the reception bucket suggests that you think again, twice, or even three times, whether it is really the time to take out the loan.
And especially where to apply for a loan, because this is probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on this website is useful, but not very detailed.
It’s more for people than for the general public.
But what would happen if we added the game?
For example, in the hotel would appear the room of our dreams.
This is because we don’t even dream of buying a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will give a share of its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after the price of Morgan Stanley’s shares fell sharply on the stock market.
A week after the preliminary agreement was disclosed, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shareholdings for $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price falls by more than 19% from the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will give it a 10% return and a $31.25 exchange rate.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on a $29 average exchange rate, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley’s stock price fell by 6.79% around 5 p.m. on average in Greenwich, closing at $23.07.
“This strategic alliance offers a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to accelerate its transformation into a banking holding company,” explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. company group.
Morgan Stanley approved a new status last week, allowing it to diversify its operations while being under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from Wall Street-listed companies.
The terms announced on Monday indicate that the agreement has been amended in recent days: on Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for approximately $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought the shares would be made entirely from shareholders,” said Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s chief executive officer in Tokyo.
"But given the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and avoid potential risks."
In terms of the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than its book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return per share decreases by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares after one year if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50 percent over a given period, i.e. rises to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that you can use funds from MUFG to leverage your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquidity.
However, the group’s spokesman did not want to provide accurate information about the two new allies’ strategic plans.
After joining MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by around 15 percent, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had improved “definitely” since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a great challenge for the group, with the price of its shares dropping by half, while the cost of insuring against non-payment risk has risen to the sky.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
Among the major investment banks, only one "survivor" remained after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, which last week announced it had raised $15 billion: part of it comes from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group of companies.
Declaration by Rafael Correa on Monday, Quito
The reconstruction of the republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is a joint plan by Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the pattern of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa explained his ideas on the new constitution on Sunday.
He successfully fulfilled his mission, with 64% of voters voting in favour in the referendum according to the official results, which referred to 80% of the votes.
According to the report, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were left unfilled by voters.
The bill needed 50% + 1 vote to be adopted.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a counting by a non-governmental organization both showed the overwhelming superiority of the “yes” votes by 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa spoke about the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The constitution has won an overwhelming victory," he said, thanking the Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, a governor's seat 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As well as the well-known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report from the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444-point text that summarized the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, reserving the state the right to "planning development" for a country that basically lives on oil mining by foreign companies and currency sent by expatriates.
The Correa Constitution, elected in 2006, also reinforces the power of the head of state, who can hold up to two consecutive terms and has the power to dissolve the parliament.
Correa has already announced that he will take advantage of this opportunity and will compete again for the presidency in February 2009.
The president has already begun introducing it in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives below the minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country. This could end the Quito and Washington agreement on the use of the Ecuadorian facility as a base for U.S. anti-drug measures.
Thirteen hostages released in Chad
Egyptian captors took 11 tourists and eight accompanies hostage for 10 days.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for ten days, from where they were transported uninjured to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in the morning by an Egyptian commander in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at about half four in the afternoon at the Al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden from stating to the press and were immediately taken to a hospital in Maadi, a suburban residential district of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are “healthy” and “no ransom paid” to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were captured on September 19 at the foot of the Ouanat mountain on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in off-road safari, and were then carried from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hostages.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, which organized the safari.
According to an Egyptian security official, a 30-member Special Command arrived on two helicopters and hit the hostages just before dawn.
"There was a fight of fire between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed and the rest fled," the leader said.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where they were supplemented with German and Italian commanders.
Italian diplomatic chief Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and Italian special operations groups.
"We must acknowledge that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence personnel and action groups," he said.
He also denied paying a ransom for the hostages.
The previous day, the Sudanese army announced that during a patrol, a off-road vehicle in which the kidnappers were travelling was arrested, six of them were killed (including the Chadi leader), and two were arrested.
The army said the hostages were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the group immediately denied.
Lettres - The "Silent Majority" of Culture
Newspapers and the ongoing election campaign are currently focusing on the debate about culture funding.
We can only rejoice.
But a piece of our cultural life is still being forgotten.
Who will raise his voice to highlight the ridiculous amounts managed by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical sites on the brink of starvation?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that it doesn’t care about its monuments and cultural heritage buildings?
Or the fact that neither Quebec nor Canada has laws that truly ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has spent three and a half million euros on restoring the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
And the Constitution of our American Neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by every citizen, every elected representative and every government agency.
Within the framework of the Federation des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, more than 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies of history, cultural heritage, archival and genealogy work on historical research and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological artifacts with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our legacy to the nail and protest with the last force of the drowning when real estate developers and policymakers direct their bulldozers toward our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalise Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries will help with partial nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, which was the first European bank in trouble due to the impact of the US credit market crisis: the three countries will support the financial and insurance institution with interests in Hungary with a total of €11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments discussed the issue at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition chief.
Fortis is the first major crisis in the euro area in the context of a global financial market crisis that has been on the rise for more than a year, so decisions about the bank can therefore be regarded as precedent in some respects.
According to the decision, the three states will buy half (49 percent) of the bank’s existing assets.
The bank will surely sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities it purchased from ABN Amro in the Netherlands last year, mostly insurance.
Fortis shares began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week, the institute was already experiencing serious crisis phenomena.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The company’s securities dropped about 12 percent on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the share value has fallen by more than two-thirds.
At current stock prices, the group’s total market capital is around €14 billion, but the company’s directors say this is unrealistic.
The company’s management blamed overseas market uncertainties over the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. package for the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the prices increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has made a substantial offer so far.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients so far, and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Race in the Chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that requires the use of prescription data in all cases with the consent of the person concerned.
This must be done independently, otherwise we’ll give the chicken to the fox,” said Richard Dicket, the developer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in the event of damages dependent on the health condition of the applicant, and if they consider the risk too high, they do not contract insurance with him.
In the past, the person was sent for medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with the knowledge of the outcome of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: the pharmacy can easily obtain from the customer’s identification number what medicines the person has purchased in the last year and a half, and from this the program itself concludes what illness he suffers and what his health status is.
For example, if you regularly take high doses of cholesterol-lowering medication, it indicates that you have practically uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which also define a risk multiplier, so the insurer has little to do outside of paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for multiple purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraines or heat waves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered to be a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, the former is not.
Special companies have been established to collect and process the data, and they ask for the consent of the patient before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure so far.
Some companies have recently processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to drug consumption data to provide an even more accurate picture of patients’ health.
More and more companies have access to data, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a separate Health Data Protection Act, but it only covers healthcare providers and insurance companies.
There is a bill before Congress that gives authorities control over companies that specialize in reporting.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: therefore he has improved his program, which would require the express consent of the data subject to the transmission of the data.
Another issue is that the person concerned can hardly refuse to consent, otherwise the insurers will not conclude a contract with him.
Thus, chickens are somewhat referred to as the kindness of the fox.
Global menu in Marseille
Trade between the EU and India doubles
As the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this theme dominated the agenda of the Ninth Summit, along with other, mostly global issues.
There will also be a French-India summit on nuclear cooperation.
While the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging democratic power that should have a greater voice in international affairs, member states have not yet reached a common denominator to support New Delhi’s permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not addressed at the Ninth Summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana have welcomed India’s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they have agreed to double trade in five years to more than 100 billion euros.
Given that trade increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
In the wake of this, 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been agreed in a legal sense, meaning that air traffic could also be operated in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to accelerate the negotiations.
The goal is to balance that while the EU is India’s top trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, were condemned in all its forms by both sides and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They also called for the end of the Doha trade round, although both have much to do with the previous failure.
The EU has reaffirmed its commitment to its energy and climate agenda to reduce emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India has also agreed to reach a global agreement at the upcoming climate conference to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
They also sought to prevent rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is heading to the French capital for a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
France has agreed to invest 20 billion euros in the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to news agencies, the deal will last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are strongly represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the most important international copyright meeting, the 60th Buchmesse.
This year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair will be attended by 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, with an area of 171,790 square meters and more than 403,000 books.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square meters through the establishment of a single Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" hall of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where data, trends and outlook on the state of Italian book publishing will also be presented.
According to the data, the share of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market continues to decline, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
Billionaire Steve Fossett missing a year ago
Billionaire Steve Fossett's plane disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The debris was found on a 3,000-foot plateau near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the border of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, dissipated any remaining doubts: "After finding the location of the plane, we sent a team and now we can be sure it was the aircraft on which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (NTSB) said hours after the debris was discovered, an investigation committee was called upon to identify the aircraft and determine that it was the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett took off on a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett’s personal belongings near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two Fosset cards issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Inspectorate, some cash and a sweater.
The search for Fossett was discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire set up a number of summits through which he entered into history.
In 2002, on a sixth attempt, he managed to fly around the Earth with a balloon for the first time: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he flew around the earth without landing.
Among his many records is his flight over the Andes at an altitude of 15,445 meters with a second pilot.
A shocking advertisement
An unusual, yet original and definite hobby car with large surfaces and clear corners.
In a few words, this is Mercedes-Benz’s latest “compact SUV” with which the German automaker has tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
This is why the unconventional content will make the introduction campaign of the SUV GLK available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17 surprise and unusual.
The advertising campaign that accompanies the introduction of the new vehicle uses an unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not been used by an Italian car brand.
The giant poster action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Comó, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with a space-effect presentation of the car, in which the new SUV will be visible in almost real size and three-dimensional form with special glasses distributed around the Corso Como.
Those who look at the picture will feel as if the car is emerging from the poster.
Then, thanks to the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one to form a single image.
With this promotion, Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new to the automotive industry’s stereotypical advertising world.
Will this bring interest to future customers?
Who are the Italian football fans?
Triveneto’s youths are likely to be excluded from the tracks.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls for whom all Italy is now ashamed? they are members of a group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the team for years and which, to be honest, has not caused too much trouble so far.
He has never fought against the opponent.
The core of the group is right.
The organizers are from Trieste.
As well as from Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udinese.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller, sporadic groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact, only a few units).
Italian flags were waved on which the fans' hometown was indicated; they were removed on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English.
In Bulgaria, they were faced with a real Nazi fan band, the Levski printers.
The Italian Football Federation issued 144 tickets for the Italian fans. These were name tickets, so it was easier to check the fans' team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: among those preparing for Sofia, there was no one against whom proceedings were underway, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian supporters who have a prius related to football were denied ticket and exit.
Currently, the Interior Ministry is awaiting the police’s protocols and is taking the necessary measures: supporters who have been arrested or identified during the riots can be punished with a five-year ban.
It is an international ban, which applies to visiting all the stadiums not only in Italy, but in Europe.
Therefore, our football hooligans cannot put their feet on any football field.
and fortunately.
But we must also fear that the huligans will find followers, that is to say, that other people will join this one hundred and fifty.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and we must not rescue those who behave in this way," the Interior Ministry said.
So it’s better to keep our eyes open, especially as Wednesday’s team match in Lecce is approaching.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports the Italian ultra.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, and on Tuesday the Committee for the Security of Sports Events, which may also be part of the internal security service, will meet for the intelligence services dealing with fan behavior.
"Duce-Duce's scandals and swinging arms under the Italian anthem is not a crime in Bulgaria..."
This idea was expressed in a rather unfortunate way by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to head the Observation Service of the Ministry of the Interior (the position was occupied by Francesco Tagliente, and before Felice Ferlizzi).
Prior to this, Mazzilli was the police chief of the city of Trieste, where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims is true, it is not forbidden to live the Ducé in Bulgaria, but even this made the behavior of the 150-200 fans embarrassing.
I am not a sociologist, the first man of the observation service added, but crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any problems. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let’s talk a little about playing the Italian anthem: it’s not a crime, but, if I can say so, it’s not well-educated.”
