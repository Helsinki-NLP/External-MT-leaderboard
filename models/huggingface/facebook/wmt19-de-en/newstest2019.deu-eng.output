The romantic shooting can be seen in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that one day one comes into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he obviously felt one or the other in the way that is stated in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the now months-long debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-times international Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed, up to a point, that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had announced his resignation from the DFB team in July, justifying it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB repeated his criticism of Özil for not being willing to talk to national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He said he didn't want to build pressure, but he knew from football that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that that conversation hasn't come to fruition."
Linz: Garden Cottage in Allotment Gardening Settlement Burned
At 2: 13 p.m., the Linz Fire Department was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the allotment, danger was in arrears.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut on arrival in full fire.
The roof had to be virtually completely removed and fire debris removed to the extent strictly necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden shed, he had plugged a battery for charging at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire - as well as the cause of the fire - has yet to be determined.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family in the street
What on earth has driven Lindsay Lohan to this most bizarre of actions?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan, 32, of "Herbie: Fully Loaded," live-streamed herself apparently trying to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
See "Luckily Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a car and walking to a possibly homeless family who claim to have identified her as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flees the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It accuses the adults of trafficking children.
She provides no evidence for any of this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching," Lohan can be heard saying in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
Apparently she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At one point, however, the obviously furious mother appears to have had enough.
It looks like she's turning around and giving Lohan a slap in the face.
The actress then tearfully admits how shocked she is - and holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is designed to approach the Ryugu asteroid so close that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The "Mascot" lander will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: Sulawesi death toll rises to more than 400
At least 420 people have been reported dead after a powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The death toll could rise even further.
Rescue teams have not yet penetrated the devastated areas, which are cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chief executive
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused a stir on the stock market in early August when he announced the electric car maker's withdrawal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but the two have now come to an agreement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla chief executive is retiring from the supervisory board, but he is allowed to remain chief executive.
British Conservative Party Conference
Tightly guarded - the Tory party conference
Birmingham is becoming the scene of a power struggle.
The party conference is expected to focus on foreign policy, trade and development, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by a row between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hardliners, led by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached an agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these duplications of names for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called Northern Macedonia in future and the population will vote on this on Sunday - will it be all right?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The one not") - that is Jair Bolsonaro.
With a week to go until Brazil's presidential election, the country's mood is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents himself as an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead in the polls.
His closest rival is Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The diesel taskforce still exists," Peter Mertens, Member of the Board of Management for Development, told the industry newspaper "Automobilwoche."
The imprisoned and placed on leave Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.
"All engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organisational changes" to ensure that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to discuss it further on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the emission cheating became known.
He said he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, currently heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the conversion to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot told "Heilbronner Stimme."
In principle, he sees a decreasing demand for saloons such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot focuses on electromobility.
There have already been 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel aims for re-election - Lahm to join DFB Presidium
Mainz (AP) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for president of the DFB again next year, despite the criticism of his person following the World Cup exit and the Özil affair.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning in ZDF's "Aktuelles Sportstudio."
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, and I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The FA chief said it would be 'strange' if he did not 'feel like working on the project for the future' following the bid for Euro 2024.
Grindel has been the head of the FA since April 2016, succeeding Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted over the summer transfer saga.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote will take place at the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head organiser of the European Championships, Philipp Lahm, is to be a member of the DFB executive committee.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that he will continue to advise in this role in the Bureau and then, of course, be cordially invited to share his experience in sports matters," Grindel said.
Lahm did not want to take part in speculation as to whether he could succeed him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national team player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Cacau, who was born in Brazil, and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, currently hold the posts.
"If someone without a migrant background has a significant impact on society and football and says" the issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Lose weight correctly with semi-smart scales
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also the percentage of body fat.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but it's more for the sausages.
It doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena the runner-up easily won with 112: 55 (52: 31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the leading scorer with 20 points.
The national team Johannes Thiemann (18 points), signed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his mandatory debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni finished with 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Giants Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83: 76 (41: 34).
New international Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter on coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
In the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
New playmaker Will Cummings topped the table with 25 points.
The Brunswick side, in which NBA star Dennis Schroeder has been the majority shareholder since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run by the baskets quickly settled the scores.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite Gülen supporters living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow PKK or Gülen sympathisers to shake our citizens and damage German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
Cologne city centre was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib Mosque.
Several thousand police were on duty - including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic Association has come under criticism because it is seen as an extension of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, boos and moments of horror
Musicians including Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have joined forces at a concert in New York's Central Park to call for greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes told a crowd of about 60,000 at the festival on Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringe and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay because I'm here and I'm ready to change the world.
Actors Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also took to the stage for the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a moment of shock, when many spectators mistook the sound of a metal barrier falling over for shots, became frightened and tried to flee.
Shortly there was panic, people were running around.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organiser Hugh Evans said.
New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the Internet.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases on the Internet.
There were cheers and applause from the audience for the numerous musicians and actors - but boos for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke on stage with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons for more equality between men and women.
But on Friday, Flake spoke out in support of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court by the US Senate Judiciary Committee, angering many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who say they experienced sexual assault confronted him in an elevator on his way to the committee meeting.
"You're welcome to join me in an elevator anytime," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was about disrupting the flow of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had arranged for bodyguards to escort the man out.
Seibert said that it is not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies irrespective of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested only at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials against them are still ongoing in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that really is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The NDR-produced talk show "Inas Nacht" is known for cheerful conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten."
Presenter Ina Müller toasts with her guests to some beer, some wine or even high percentage drinks to lighten the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebs also drink themselves into the guts for the obligatory singing interludes.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was taped.
This time around: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" and "The Horniest Day."
But the trip to the far north didn't go down well with the Munich native.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled, his eyes just two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he just has a mighty hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black pig.
And splash.
And leave out the round of eggnog that Ina throws at half past three.
The 43-year-old's drinking is certainly written all over his face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sandwiches, or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves at the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly binge is not yet known.
But since she has presented the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
Over a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and filth
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and is littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarce.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and garbage, demolished garbage bins and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa presents itself for a long time.
A more than inglorious sight for the showpiece railway cycle path in Rotkäppchenland.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the city's cycling commissioner.
The issue had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local advisory board.
It's not just garbage that drives cyclists and residents wild - the seating area is a regular meeting point for partying at weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the banquets also involve destruction: poles torn out of the ground, rubbish bins demolished, signs folded over, seats smeared.
Volunteers have cleaned up more often, ADFC member Susanne Klippert says.
But the actions are just the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for binge drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also concerned about the new bike centre in Ziegenhain, which opens today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea, he said, is video surveillance on the hill: "It may raise the threshold for seizing public property considerably.
This would, however, require a police patrol to pass by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen would like to see the Haaße Hill develop.
It needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path so far one can be very satisfied.
The tourism marketing is still expandable.
Compared to others in Germany, our bike path is of very high quality, "the ADFC members said.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as an extremely critical danger point.
There is no turning track on the Haaße hill.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two traffic flows, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creatively and in cooperation.
"D is a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener who lived for a long time in Hiltrup, the nine from the "Hiltrup Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the lyricists see themselves associated with?
Lake Hiltruper and Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently in these places.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Time and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke enlivened the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke knew from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has put all sorts of stuff on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltrup gastronomy.
For the favorites of the jury there was nevertheless something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two kindergarten teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the finale - and sounded "really good," as Franke said, even without electronic support.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had brought the event to life on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams sitting opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen with four cards with keywords, which you can only decipher - the old trick with the red foil - once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything, even by mistake.
The cards, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Cube.
4. Feast. "
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that perhaps says "3.4.2."
The purpose of "Decrypto" is not to guess the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe the terms "dice," "solid" and "window" - in this order and in this example - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct sequence and the opposing team does not, as far as possible, because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encrypter notes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "party" and "Prague" would also be possible, because he was careful at school and knows the lintel there.
So it goes on round after round, team after team.
One does not know the terms of the other side - but it can rhyme better with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
The descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite a long time and in detail, until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much emotion there is in this inconspicuous game.
All in all, though, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames," which also imposes an agent theme on a game of few words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you're only interested in guessing and not winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in pub
A 48-year-old man was arrested at Kulmbach police station on Saturday night.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper City, later he also caught the eye in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he failed to comply with the police reprimand when clearly drunk, he had to spend the night in the detention cell at the Kulmbach police inspectorate.
When sober, he must then also be held criminally responsible for the use of the hallmarks of unconstitutional organizations.
Depot Pressig was home of the pusher locomotives
For decades, the railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Franconian Forest.
In 1991, a piece of railway history came to an end.
"When buffer after buffer popped, you could hear it all over Pressig," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It didn't upset anyone.
Then the brakes squealed and the cars rattled.
That was just pure railroad.
Statements that stand symbolically for Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain section to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres in altitude.
In order to cope with this, train and drawer locomotives used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, catenary and railway maintenance.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which, after being rebuilt in 1899, had a diameter of 18 metres," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railwayman for 47 years.
The railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was placed under the authority of Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the Volksblatt reported a staff of 160; 13 steam and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimised the need for train and push locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 wagons were still manoeuvred per month.
Parts of the factory were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that a better use of the site has not been envisaged, including in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the 50th anniversary of the electrification of Nuremberg - Saalfeld with a pompous station party in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
"The marshallers and brake shoe layers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening win at China Open
BEIJING (AP) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing, just like Julia Görges before them.
Kerber beat France's Kristina Mladenovic 6-2, 6-2 at the China Open.
Next opponent is either Julia Putintseva of Kazakhstan or Spain's Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Darya Kassatkina when the Russian 13th seed retired.
The sister-in-law will now face Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Pleasure," a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
Twenty-one works by 20 artists are now on display in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He has been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and helped to design flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, a 70-cent special stamp designed by them will be available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn auPunching," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased about the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won over for the musical accompaniment.
Walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "wind chime performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
The "Tree of Fortune" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, awaits the visitor at the entrance to the property on the right.
It is a tree stump, brightened up in colour, playfully equipped with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object looks magically pensive and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate 15 years of K & G to the event in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy constructions made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Wind chime performance" invites you to stroll through the multifaceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albeists also vented their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They definitely did not want to resign themselves to the fact that, after the dissolution of the church choir "Cecilia," there would no longer be any singing life in the district.
In the meantime, it has become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbusch they launched the MGV 68 albums.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter."
"It will be full today," guessed chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be proved right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Particularly for the anniversary they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
It was an elegant ball, festive attire had been requested beforehand.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounters," but sat comfortably at tables.
In between, there was movement: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked to join the dancefloor.
It was a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 albums let their voices be heard themselves.
Suitable for the occasion cheerful songs were announced.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus," which is the Latin name for "hops," sounded.
The choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiege: "He has such an easy manner, it's a masterpiece that he achieves." By the way, it wasn't just men who presented themselves as singers this time.
The women's choir "Hohes C," whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s, was also a guest.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatross Youth Centre.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve team of USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is getting along really well in League Three.
No sign of timidity or fracas, the independents are doing their thing.
And that in the 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city rival BW Aasee really well.
"It wasn't crystal clear, but we made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening at a retrospective birthday party of Ronja de Boer the atmosphere was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set the score had a set point.
"If they get it right, a game like this can tip over," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, USC made it all clear with its routine power and brought the full yield to the finish line.
'We're all aware of who is on the other side in a derby like this.
That doesn't break our necks.
I saw some really good volleyball in phases, "Annacker did not quarrel with the 0-3 - and immediately went back to business as usual.
After just three days of play, it seems impossible to see where the independents are headed.
"It is simply too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one sense does he feel vindicated: "The third division has an unbelievably good level.
This is not remotely comparable to regional league volleyball. "They no longer want to look down into the fourth league anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first assessment can only be made after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will compete in Essen on 14 October.

On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Traumschiff."
Now she is speaking candidly about how the show may have been complicit in her marital breakdown with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the head hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she disembarked for good.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she was married for ten years.
'That might have been a reason, 'he said.
Because I grew up with this work, travelling around the world on my own with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired perceived me at eye level, "Keller told" Bild am Sonntag "in an interview.
At first she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.
'I don't know if he enjoyed it that much. '
She believes it is possible that her then husband may have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans shied away from talking about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in plain English: I have disguised myself, "she goes on to explain.
She had always felt she was "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even though I sometimes appeared brash and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "even though I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil ceremony I sat crying in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
His marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I've been far too naive in my approach to love. '
The moth, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the glare of a green carpet at Sechseläutenplatz dazzles him unduly.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to bask in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, for example, he staggers across the square in order to relieve himself briefly in the "Aquaclean Toilet Oasis."
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the sanitary facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion goes to great lengths to exude a luxurious ambience.
But this evening, for some reason, it stinks to heaven in the men's oasis.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, whom the opening film "Green Book" has just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as is well known, the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you have to come up with in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a ribbon around the antennae, which a fairy godmother has put in for him, and two beefy bouncers wave him in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, dancing long past midnight to live music or letting the DJ dictate rhythms to which they shout at each other, wash down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for that!
The butterfly studies the sign on the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has blundered into the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the housewares department upstairs, the wingman tips a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye," to match the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here for the evening either.
But then, between the local celebrities, the cash desk and kitchen articles, a face passes by that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor is unlikely to be far behind.
And really: Right away Viggo Mortensen, at almost sixty, walks through the crowd looking almost like a choirboy.
He is not gossiped at, he is not gawked at, he is at most stealthily squinting.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as obstinacy, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates Mexico win with cumbia dance
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona appears to have settled in well in his new home of Mexico.
After his club Dorados de Sinaloa's 2-0 win, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the dressing room, according to a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip, a team member dances around Maradona in a yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division side had beaten the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Verband Liga 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute bust-up
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His charges were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly for long phases, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept," annoyed the ASV coach.
The home side quickly led 8-1, and the early timeout Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
By the break, the deficit was just two goals.
Above all, Send's best man, Marius Hintze, arrived at the stage.
After the change it got even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalized for 15: 15, then the relay changeover led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the margin was still a seemingly reassuring three goals (29-26).
And then?
Let the impartial get on with it.
Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff received "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood up well against seven men at the back and kept throwing at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now we need a damn victory," said Bieletzki.
Goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hillingdon (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Hof County), police are searching for the woman's remains.
Emergency workers dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers below it were removed, according to a joint statement by the police and the public prosecutor's office.
New evidence suggests the missing woman may have been buried not far from where she lived at the time.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Hof Criminal Police Department has been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecutor's office, according to the information.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators used a ground radar to find an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained for the smell of human bones, the officials limited the area to a few meters.
The results of the excavations were due to be announced in the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users highlights the dangers lurking online.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped imminent dismissal as boss of the billion-dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission settled out of court a lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost his license to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay $20 million, and Musk will also step down as chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German chief executive.
However, he is allowed to remain chief executive.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space firm SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is unaware of any guilt
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share, with funding secured.
That would have valued Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Musk later backtracked, saying Tesla remained on the stock market.
Under the deal, Tesla will now have to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp's team 1-1 Chelsea

Germany international Antonio Rudiger cleared on the line after a solo effort from Liverpool's top scorer Mohamed Salah (31st).
Shortly before the end Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a looping shot into the corner.
Record-breaking Manchester United are slipping deeper and deeper into crisis after their worst start to the season since 1989.
Controversial coach Jose Mourinho's side lost 1-3 at West Ham United and remain in mid-table with ten points after seven games.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance following an injury to Petr Cech.
Ahead of Tuesday's Champions League game at Hoffenheim, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion thanks to goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th).
Leroy Sané made it 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not on target.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert became known through the RTL show "Let's Dance."

Bild am Sonntag, citing Llambi's lawyer, reported on the split between the well-known presenter and dance expert.
"Our clients have parted amicably and amicably," the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser said, according to BamS.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, GroKo is cashing in on several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in Germany in the Emnid-Sonntag poll for Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly poll conducted by the polling institute, the AfD gained one point to 17 percent, while the SPD dropped one point to 16 percent compared to the previous week.
The CDU and CSU also lose one point and are only on 27 percent.
This is the lowest level ever recorded for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens achieve 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
According to Emnid, if Sunday's federal elections were held, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would collectively receive only 43 percent of the votes.
As a result, the grand coalition has now lost a majority on the Sunday question in all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently win 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag Election, they collectively received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, comes in at 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens get 12.5 to 17 percent of the vote.
The left averages 10 percent, the FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the share of the vote.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person for the chancellery, according to the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to last until the next regular federal election in three years, while 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
Another poll released on Saturday also showed a clear drop in Merkel's popularity.
Germans are also split on whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, while 44 percent are against.
Among the Union supporters, 64 percent want a candidate, 35 percent do not.
Aldi advert: Reduced prices to make love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says there are no romantic get-togethers any more in the age of Tinder should have a conversation about turkey at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" through Tinder and co. the supermarket radiates an almost anachronistic romance as a meeting place for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts at the table or your favourite pudding is still a better story for future grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less of a contact and more of a slippery slope.
We dared the test: How do women react if you don't talk about it for a long time in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
There is real Hollywood love story potential when happiness is preceded by a lost-and-found-out-of-sight-plot.
When the guy also contacts his beloved at the email address bio-turkey @ gmx.de, it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and the like - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is to be wished that the author of this advertisement in an Aldi store unknown to us, that she will also find her dream man, with whom she talked briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat."
She definitely deserves her Hollywood-style happy ending for believing in the magic of getting to know each other.

Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for Götze
Leverkusen (AP) - Borussia Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that is not good for us, "Reus, who is a friend of Götze, told the TV channel Sky after the 4: 2 victory in Leverkusen.
Zorc had stressed before the game.

"There will definitely be a moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky television on Sunday night.
Football: District: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine encourages
There were moments in this fledgling season when Alois Fetsch took a hard line with his own.
The coach of VfL Wolbeck, the regional football league, gave himself very little words, first withdrew (inwardly) in order to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer proof is the 1: 1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only razor-thin past the promotion.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
'We've made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was impressive, "Fetsch praised his boys and went to each and every one of them after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came in for him - the 4-4-2 changed almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more plays in the first period.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before retiring (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
That almost paid off when the SCA scored twice in minute 41 in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer in front of the Wolbeck box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes narrowly missed from 18 yards.
Schroer was also late for a Thewes substitution after 58 minutes.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When substitute Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhue in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free-kick for the hosts 18 yards out.
The fouled player stepped up and demonstrated his dangerousness at the other end.
Westhues "right-foot shot struck the bottom left corner from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes to go, which should be pretty damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unfortunately took the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the spot.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to endure anxious minutes in the closing stages before Geske scored the winning goal from twelve metres in the 87th minute.
Maybe it was too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 over Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96 Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure their first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting line-up for the first time after injury, should help.

Helicopter crashes in Kottingbrunn
On landing, there was an accident on the still at the airfield.
The four occupants suffered minor injuries.
clock on Sunday at the airfield in Kottingbrunn there was a drama.
There was turbulence when a helicopter landed, police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was hit by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a halt on its side.
Immediately the police, rescue and fire brigade were notified.
The emergency services arrived at the scene of the accident with a large contingent.
The ÖAMTC Emergency Medical Helicopter was also called as a precaution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, it all turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.

According to fire department spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, but it was quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
As of September 1, only 8 percent of the board members were women, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was presented in advance to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
"Companies will have to reposition themselves otherwise international competitors will pass them by," said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, all-male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also attributable solely to positive impulses among companies in the index of medium-sized stocks (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are women.
In the previous year, however, the figure was 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, there were 26 women on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit women more consistently in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signalled that they will not continue to make a voluntary commitment to increase the share from the previously "zero percent."
A different picture emerges for the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited to the boards each year, the proportion would have reached 40 percent by 2023," the report said.

Who makes the most profit per car among the high-end suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers pocket for each car they sell?
"Autopapst" and professor of economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros per car sold in the first six months of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only makes around 800 euros, and Tesla and Bentley even make a big profit on every car sold.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the running with prices averaging between 33,000 and 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and tax.

"It's great that so many people have found their way to Abtswind again." Later, "Die Troglauer" provided the atmosphere.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had fixed the drink prices in the afternoon on the occasion of the anniversary, as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before the second round takes place one day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency car crashes into taxi
An ambulance stands badly damaged beside a road.
A 27-year-old passer-by has been fatally injured in a collision between the emergency vehicle and a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - preferably save lives.
One such rescue mission ended fatally for a 26-year-old woman in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in a collision between an emergency doctor's car and a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had run over a red light with blue lights and a red light on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided at an intersection with a taxi that was driving at Green.
The ambulance crashed into a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
He caught the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were trapped in their vehicles with serious injuries and had to be rescued by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself but was unable to help the pedestrian.
Another emergency doctor called in tried - but to no avail.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
In close coordination with the Bonn public prosecutor's office, the police are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, it's uncomfortable for Mourinho
After a humiliating run in the League Cup, Manchester United are now also losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU lost 1-3. The manner of the defeat should still be a talking point.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute when the rejuvenated Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham to make it 3-1, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had seemingly put the Red Devils back in the game.
Suspecting that Mark Noble's pass was offside, Manchester City's defenders paused and gave Arnautovic all the time in the world to fire the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative culmination of a performance that had already been largely inadequate.
The mood at United's city rivals Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola, cruised to an unassailable 2-0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion.
Raheem Sterling broke through the home side's defence for the first time after half an hour.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalscorer, ensured the sixth win in the seventh game, and thus the leap to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer league leaders
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri scored for Liverpool in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea in the Premier League.
As with the Cup exit, Belgium's Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who came on for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his looping shot.
After the Reds started the week with an unblemished record, Chelsea were undefeated for the second time.
First the Londoners eliminated Jurgen Klopp's team in the cup, then the draw in the league saw the Blues drop Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London clubs, Tottenham (at Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford), celebrated 2-0 victories.
The Gunners fans, with Granit Xhaka on the bench, had to wait until the 81st minute for news of their success against the surprise Hertfordshire team.
Nine minutes from the end Watford defender Craig Cathcart unluckily booked an own goal from Alex Iwobi, and just two minutes later Mesut Özil secured the win with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to a fifth straight win and are now fifth in the table, just behind big rivals Tottenham, while promotion-chasing Wolverhampton continue to make a strong impression under Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth time in a row during their 2-0 win over Southampton and are eighth in the table.
VW core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show dominated by diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, they will be showcasing their new products in the French capital alongside competitors from around the world at the 2018 Motor Show.
Diesel does not really play a major role in this anymore.
Nevertheless, the possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz will be there, among other things, with their first all-electric models: the e-tron from Ingolstadt is due to be launched on the market at the end of the year, and the EQC from Stuttgart in 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not due to launch until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3-series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
A good one million visitors came in 2016.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged, and there has been enormous material damage.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a celebration.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
The figures so far are only from Palu.
But many other communities - along Sulawesi's west coast - are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the closing service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral needs of the horsepower two-wheeler.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of each month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
clock the cars were already lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the Biker-Frühschoppen was on the program and it was possible to fortify oneself with coffee and cake or even with a hearty Currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service by Rev. Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical accompaniment was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues-rock, Valerie Lill strikes a more poetic and calm tone," says Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He carried his apple press with him and demonstrated the process step by step from ripe apple to apple juice to his amazed spectators.
From time to time Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples into the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how it would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to watch this important piece of work late on Friday afternoon.
Packed in moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which looked a little like chopped apple, layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the final step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large jar.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had already bottled specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good wine "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorfer camaraderie of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also in the coming year the local association will offer a day of action.
But then, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the scene.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: after all, it will be all about the milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth loss of the season: "Crappy situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and encouraged them.
However, there were not many positives to be seen in the 1: 4 (0: 2) of last in the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a crappy situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-year-old Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "Of course it's disappointing, because you always set yourself a lot."
The further winless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) scored, stand with two points at the bottom and are in their current condition a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, however, Frankfurt celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45. + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of 46,300 spectators. After the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League game against Lazio Rom, he moved up into the midfield with seven points.
Croatia's World Cup runner-up Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous attacking move on his debut and could never get a grip on Hannover's defence.
With his pace and assertiveness, the striker, who had been struggling for a long time after the World Cup, showed why he is so valuable to Eintracht.
Alongside Rebic, Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was in the starting line-up for the first time for the Frankfurt side, who started briskly.
A header from Lucas Torró (17th), deflected onto the net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back), who had dropped out at short notice.
The lead for the home side was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller prolonged with his head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to put his foot down.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender, who joined from French second division side AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt levelled before the break.
This time, Haller matched his Storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked through and left 96 goalie Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time Hanover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his team and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony played a bit more courageously, but there were no bright ideas until just before the end, when at least the opening goal was scored.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
Just under an hour later Rebic launched a solo shot and then crossed for De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show for the Frankfurt team against overtaxed guests, Jovic also scored one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz turns into a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter made it in front of millions of spectators at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week by two strokes.
Geisingen: Geising Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
Geising Catholics celebrate the feast of the Holy Cross on 14 September or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the Shot Christ, which comes from the Thirty Years "War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the Shot Christ, which led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not yet finished, only the sanctuary is standing, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite its importance for the Geising parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the divine service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the final blessing marked the end of the ecclesiastical part of the feast of the Cross.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish hall.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather-adapted farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction work, which will continue into next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been detected, which was only made possible by inspection using scaffolding.
The plaster work on the base has been completed, the natural stone work is to start before winter, and it is hoped that more than half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New Residence in Neu-Ulm Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
All those present agreed at the inauguration that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its intended purpose in Münsterblickstraße.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the home of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas were taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officers "building of the US Army was put to the test for residents with mobile phone caps:" The house was getting old and out of date in terms of equipment, "Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
According to the architect, the new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction method was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move around without outside help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, made a similar comment: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need aids in order to be mobile."
The cosiness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck, because it is no longer available in the present situation."
The new residence hall on Münsterblickstraße offers a total of almost 1500 square metres of space for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz, the managing director of Lebenshilfe, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to the tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, the deputy leader of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag. "
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans work on average longer than people in West Germany, but receive 15 percent less salary.
"I cannot explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after German unification," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is this cute dog ending the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hound is meant to smooth the waters between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae-In two North Korean pungsan hounds as a gift.
Moon's office said on Sunday that the two dogs, who are about one year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They passed through the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to make it "easier for the animals to adapt."
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly bid to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
As part of the rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test site for rocket engines.
Austria's eventful history reflected in 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has now been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archives, takes a very different view in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" (picture book) Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to business - that is the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's working week starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not recently conjured up a mantra-like "return to work."
This may have led some craftsmen, women doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and specialised work, but so be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its task - governing - it should not be prevented from doing so now by debating concepts.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last weeks, will probably already show on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the squabbling.
But first, with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law, conflict-prone topics are back on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums lightly, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement became apparent in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled labour immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or undergoing training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another row among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
It is not equal and equal that has joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social concepts and priorities.
Controversy is good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests cannot move forward.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes must not once again be exaggerated for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always keep the reality of life of the people in view.
What is feasible and good for many?
This key question can be used to pragmatically clarify both the diesel and lane change issues - and thus win back trust.
Above all, that is what the people's parties must fight for now.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Targeting ministers
Does the Minister for Employment, of all people, violate the applicable law on employment?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" their legalists had been working on social security reform, an effusive welfare minister reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
The statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) meets with astonishment from Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger - she now brings the matter to parliament via question.
She said she believed "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and in no way to announce breaches of applicable service law in front of running cameras."
Still, she said, she now has questions about whether Hartinger "can be cleared of any suspicion."
Police tear up a street in search for woman's body
Police declined to comment for a long time.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, digging has been taking place on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The track is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
Investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able to narrow down the relevant area to a few metres together with his guide.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the aforementioned road section.
For more than a year now, the public prosecutor and the criminal police Hof have been working on the missing persons case.
Again and again a bicycle path was closed near Marxgrün and examined with sonar equipment, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colouring powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence referendum.
But even before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Clashes between separatists and police broke out in central Barcelona on the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017.
Catalan security forces were attacked with paint powder, among other things, by pro-independence demonstrators as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to hold a rally to honour their colleagues who were at the polling stations during last year's referendum, which was deemed illegal.
There was also violence at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
Catalan police have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations by separatists and central security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6000 separatists then tried to break through the police chain by force and pelted the officers with paint bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the statement said, citing authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under receivership in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
However, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
Elections were held in the region in December.
The sequestration ended after the new Catalan government took office in May.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the Catalans "" right to self-determination. "
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split goalless
Red-and-white awls continue to stand still.
Even at FC Gütersloh only a 0-0 draw was enough.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be helpless at the end and the third last.
The first half was barely manageable from the entertainment point of view.
Those who preferred to get a beer or a sausage could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a scoring chance because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
In the 28th minute, Weltersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal of the whole match.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle the only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to parade with a shot from the penalty area after 32 minutes.
The hosts were even more innocuous.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came in for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just over the housing and after an hour also the Gütersloh appeared offensively for the first time.
After a shooting conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fast.
Nick Flock (62.) crowned the speedy counter-attack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also went ahead with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
The Ahlens did not achieve more than visual superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was not until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but even that brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately the zero was also in front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent had no desire to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was splattering a little bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
In any case, I did not feel that we could get a counter-goal, "said Daut.
Unfortunately for him, as a spectator, you did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
Thanksgiving Market: Luckily, there's enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausstellungsstelle, for whom these donations are intended, are pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, while the square was still a little empty, but that was to change during the day.
"It's so convivial here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a good pinch of humour, as usual.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stepped in at short notice for the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) fell ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "substitute" did not miss the opportunity to entertain the ever-increasing number of visitors musically in between.
This was so well received that some folk songs were sung along at a late hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer happily.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many active players with their stands, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually there should be no such thing as a blackboard at all," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the dedication of all who worked at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city is given a colourful coat of paint - something is possible here.
Then the maikranz was removed by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
Many booths were used for the physical well-being.
Everything from sweet to savory was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative with his scroll saw.
Veneer work, beer mats with Reckenfeld motifs and much more he had on offer.
Three beekeepers from Reckenfeld offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honey," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has one more speciality.
Honey cake in a glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to reach for it again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the Autumn Festival.
Smears with local political message: No successful advertisement for skate park
In Lengerich, unknown persons have hardly promoted the construction of a skate park in a conducive way.
In several places there are corresponding smears, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are emblazoned in large letters on signs at, among others, the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the occupation election fair on 19 September a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt Bistro.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an edding at the time, it could have been easily removed.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed on," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign will have to be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realisation will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already pledges, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies that appear on the smeared board.
Local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate facilities for years.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL-Klinik, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The council ultimately voted overwhelmingly in favour of the fire brigade car park.
However, this idea was not implemented - apparently too many factors spoke against building at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee voted unanimously in favour of the Gutenberg School premises.
As things stand, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The city council will then have the final say.
He said he expected a decision to be made this year, so if there is a positive vote, construction could begin in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come," Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the well-known shortage of staff at European air traffic control centres, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new controllers will take four to five years," the union said.
Throughout Europe, the market for fully trained air traffic controllers has been emptied.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing for monitoring the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that several aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the Federal Government, the Länder, air traffic control, the airlines and the airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional condensation of work and overtime, that will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members in the German air navigation service provider Deutsche Flugsicherung.
Maas once again blamed EU Commission directives for the pilot plight.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low, he said.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air navigation services are now having a full impact on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not further tighten the air traffic control system."
Currently, the EU guidelines are being coordinated until 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He said he hoped the high cost of delays would prompt a rethink among airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary increase in personnel is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp's interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the troubled group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reductions in addition to the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory board counts only eight heads on the capital side.
This is contrasted with ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be made at a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, will combine its elevator and supply business.
Barcelona: Violence during demonstrations by police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan pro-independence demonstrators in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with many injured.
According to the municipality, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police had tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
Pro-independence activists, however, repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier, according to the force.
They allegedly attacked the officers with paint and projectiles.
There were also scuffles, according to reports, between participants in the various protest marches.
Emergency services said 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to use their demonstration to pay tribute to their colleagues who almost exactly a year ago took action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez told AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who wished to give his name only as Daniel, denied the allegation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman said.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of UK ministers
A security breach on a mobile phone app has led to the personal data of Tory ministers and MPs being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the glitch became public the day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The Hanover police reported a serious traffic accident on Sunday morning on the main road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people have died when their car crashed into a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
Emergency services are on the scene.

Football: Juve coach praises Ronaldo's best game after top match
Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised the Portuguese star striker after the 3: 1 (1: 1) victory of the record-breaking champions against Napoli.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important match against the chasing pack, even without an own goal.
"Ronaldo has had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to three assists from Ronaldo, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early on through Dries Mertens' 10th-minute goal and left their closest challengers hanging on for dear life.
The scorer, who was brought in by Real Madrid, first laid on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double (26th / 49th).
And Ronaldo's header from a corner was followed by a goal from defender Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had to push in just short of the goal line.
"He gives a lot of assists," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the club's record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach said.
Mandzukic is currently Juve's top scorer with four goals - Ronaldo has three.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is an unblemished streak in Serie A. The champions of the past seven years are already six points clear of Napoli on 21 points.
The second-placed team, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, were not without chances against Torino.
But at the latest after the already warned Mario Rui (58th) the top match was decided.
The Portuguese was forced off the pitch with a yellow and red after going too hard on Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Napoli," said the Turin coach.
Emre Can, too, could feel aggrieved.
The German international has established himself at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, has played in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri described as "half an hour" as Ronaldo flew off the pitch in the Turin side's 2-0 win and is suspended for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West has attracted attention with a particularly bizarre appearance on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume raised eyebrows and question marks among viewers.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, he will only be called "Ye," according to the musician.
'The creature formerly known as Kanye West, 'he tweeted, referencing the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news, however.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "" the rapper said.
Football: A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a poor game from us today.
The opponent was simply more catchy, we hardly ever presented him with problems. "The list of Hoetmar bullet possibilities reads accordingly thin.
Just two scoring chances in 90 minutes, so it's rare to make games positive.
Soccer League A1: SC Hoetmar defeats SG Sendenhorst 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
SG also had only two chances in the first round, but Maik Krause took advantage of the first from an acute angle to take an early lead (7th).
Steffen Uphus could have raised the score in the 43rd minute, but after excellent preparatory work by Krause, he missed.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne failed to clear goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst keeper.
After the break, the visitors became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
Niklas Eilmann was also unable to make use of a trading metre - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - for the visitors (75th).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line, the match was decided (81.).
Florian Kraus summed up: "We had criticised ourselves harshly before, but today was different from the last few weeks."
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0-1 Krause (7th), 0-2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh defeats Concordia 3: 4
"I don't know what to make of it," he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all." By that he presumably meant the wingtongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kroeger, but probably also all the other green-whites who caught the eye with their collective offensive urge.
Still, he could laugh: "A dirty win," he said, winking cheekily and pulling away from his players, but there was a sense of relief that they had pulled away with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which plays for the championship, namely Albacht, and the other, Albersloh, fights for the league title.
Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes with understandably mixed emotions.
"That was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
'The way we came back from 0-2 down, the way we fought back throughout the game against one of the top teams in the league, it's been phenomenal. '
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner gave the hosts the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two touches of the ball in that game for that goal.
He made it 2-0 via the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
'That was insane what he did, 'Lewandowski acknowledged of his opponent's quality.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own team managed to equalise: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long corner of the goal (45th).
After the change of sides, it was McGill who scored the equaliser (59th).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite outnumbering Albersloh was not able to counter the last hit of the Concordia (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
'The game against Schapelle, that's what we have to win now, 'Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kroeger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1-0 Zymner (24th), 2-0 Fröhning (39th), 2-1 McGill (45th), 2-2 McGill (59th), 3-2 Nübel (64th), 3-3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4-3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74 / 8).
Football: TSV Strasbourg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Bundesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The championship leader had actually come for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff stood very well and in the end the game ended 0: 0.
Media: entire executive committee of Dynamo Dresden resigns
The entire executive committee of second division football club Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
In the evening, several media outlets unanimously referred to a joint letter from the Board of Saxons.
There was no confirmation from the club at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be infighting at the former Bundesliga club.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
Glad he's gone.
There are few guests of state whose departure in Germany is as much of a relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had thought he should not have been invited at all.
Protestant Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled he will personally pick up the prize in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But Wulff was there before and after.
Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him in when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Chancellors have been with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep turning up at the Academy at Schloss Tutzing was also a topic during the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September, writer Frido Mann attends a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed to accept personally the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which television presenter Dunja Hayali also receives in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences up to mid-2019 are a real challenge.
"The pension is not safe!" reads a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarism without limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war makes a mockery of every humane idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical transformation of work through digitisation.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting to mark the 200th anniversary of
Some expect more visitors in the direction of criticism of capitalism, while others expect a tendency "from the far left to the centre."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Musical Cabaret: Understanding Gender with the Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist Teubner buttoned up the understanding of the sexes, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Te'o.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes has his say until the end of the movement, and on the other, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies so brilliantly harmoniously that some might have wished for a solo.
That was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, namely as it suited the theme of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of a man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have arisen from Mozart's composing if "das Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" to the "Lied vom Tod," and from Mozart's Symphony in G minor into a playful little dance.
There was huge applause and "Bravo" from the packed hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not let an additional thanks be taken away.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk will be allowed to remain chief executive of electric car maker Tesla but will have to relinquish the chairmanship of the board.
Musk also agreed to pay a double-digit million-dollar fine with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC said.
The background to this is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he wanted to take Tesla off the stock market.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements.
Bruchsal.
Following a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly revised the number of victims down.
He said 10 passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
All have since been discharged from hospital.
The French bus driver had remained in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released later in the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the long-distance bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The bus had crashed head-on into a guardrail without braking on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's Bundesliga: Ahlener SG retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who marked ten goals alone.
"Actually I was happy with the defence, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn't get a grip on it, "said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed chances.
His team lacked concentration in the closing stages this time.
The ASG therefore trailed almost to the end, was behind at the break with 11: 12 and later with 15: 18 (45th).
Only towards the end did the wider bench of hostesses make a decisive impact.
Aydogdu also set up left-back Merle Klement, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Frauen: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3. Liga West.
The Blue-Whites won 3-1 at second division relegation club VC Allbau Essen
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We have now earned that, "said a delighted coach Dominik Münch after an almost flawless performance of his team in the toppled championship leader.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went with 25: 15 to the runner-up of the previous year.
Essen accepted in the two-bar, but did not come into play.
We kept them busy.
Our opponent pitched with high risk, but also produced quite a few tickets.
In the second set the BSV already led with 12: 8. "Essen has changed the adoption to three bars.
We couldn't keep up the impact pressure.
Food got sucked in and we got lulled a little bit, "Münch said.
At 18: 17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area were ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern fended off four set balls at 19: 24, the fifth attempt found its target.
"The game was a class better now," the head coach said of the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the tables in the third period from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13 brought the blue and white passage four with 25: 22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish Community: Mosque Opening a Missed Opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the manner of the inauguration of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a heap of fragments in German-Turkish relations, which can only be swept together with difficulty," the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, told the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing side by side with German leaders the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "reinforced many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's Folktreff time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 19.30 hrs the Heimatverein Nottuln is already organising its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly to the day, it is then a year ago that we held a Folktreff for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of Nottuln's musical calendar, "says Hanns Moormann, chairman of Nottulner Heimatverein.
I never thought that our Folktreff would establish itself so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was Storm Friederike in January or a heatwave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always full.
"As always, the programme at the next Folktreff is a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites musicians who are friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed to the first Folktreff- "Birthday" with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt that played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of Folktreff gladly remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten delighted the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent them home with an ear worm.
"We count on many happy guests, in order to spend once again a convivial and humorous evening," it says in the invitation of the homeland association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and feels like getting actively involved is invited to take part.
Since the coveted seats are always filled quickly, it is advisable to arrive early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China clears proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step towards becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the multi-billion dollar merger still has to be approved in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the US.
According to an insider, the chances of approval there had recently improved because Linde had agreed to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the District Association for Horticulture and Land Management was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893, the last impulses for the foundation of the Kulmbach Regional Association for Horticulture and Landscape Care were given with a fruit show in the Kulmbach Clubhouse, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach Stadthalle.
Of course, it was called differently at that time: as the "Bezirkssobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" it was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was purely about fruit-growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the age of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said district home keeper Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees were to line trunk roads, so-called industrial gardens were to be created at schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But that is far from the end of the spectrum.
Near-natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as the imparting of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Moles" entertainingly demonstrated on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said the district chairman Günter Reif, and also Mayor Henry Schramm emphasized how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect as much joy with a smartphone.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"The district association decides where they are to be located," added District Administrator Söllner and emphasised the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left district manager and consultant Friedhelm Haun no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
In the old days everything came from the garden, it was doused for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature endures, it was there before us and we have to orientate ourselves by it," pleaded the expert for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to slacken, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian regional association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the brass of the Thurnau Music Association.

Canada's foreign minister postpones UN speech on Nafta talks
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They are giving both trading partners an ultimatum for a deal.
Canada's foreign minister is now making the trade agreement an absolute priority - and postponing her speech at the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York because of time constraints in the struggle to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico.
The minister will not address the United Nations General Assembly until Monday instead of Saturday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she said, she will focus on renegotiating Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada and the US negotiators have 48 hours to reach an agreement if Canada really wants to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the US.
The US and Mexico agreed in August to revise the Nafta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Discussions on a new edition have been ongoing for over a year.
They are now due to be finalised by Sunday evening (local time) and Trump's administration wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada should negotiations fail.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.
According to a report in the daily "O Globo," the far-right ex-military man wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives.
Following his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the final week before the presidential election.
The politician was attacked in the street during an election rally in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not"), mainly women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations also mobilized on social networks against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers "Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore barred from standing.
Brazil's presidential election is on October 7.
As the ex-mayor of the metropolis of São Paulo, Haddad has lagged far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, but has recently emerged as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieve an absolute majority in the first round, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers reckon Bolsonaro will not emerge victorious from this one - no matter who he runs against.
Bolsonaro is known for railing against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again, he shocks with verbal gaffes.
On another occasion, he said supporters of Lula's leftist Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairytale just outside Paris.
Captain Thomas Bjorn's underdog team dethroned the favourite defending champion USA by a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators over the three days at Le Golf National with great strokes and outstanding team spirit.
Danish rock legend has died after a long illness
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
At his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin ', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band disbanded in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the anti-monarchy Larsen had performed at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock Night in the Shoe Factory: Volume at Pneumatic Hammer Level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three bands who are friends of each other.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There was no sign of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - and their bands loudly enthuse the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with newest, unknown pieces of their own writing and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage the audience dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "Encore" cries cannot be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not just hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates by the change from melodic passages to the guitar-driven rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, meanwhile, has gained a special degree of recognition since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in collaboration with the band on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo, running through the audience, to the sound, which is felt to be even more highly controlled than before.
Of course, a certain volume is required for such a hard rock concert due to the genre: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing desk team, the volume at the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is around 98 decibels.
This is about on the level of a pneumatic hammer, but is still well below the levels of the "Wacken Fesitval," which "The Ignition" refer to on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need a deafening 120 decibels in jet engine volume as usual at the annual metal rendezvous in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking style have long since convinced with their confident, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," can all three groups, of course in the figurative sense, say at the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
A glider crashed on a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the crash.
Near the airport Mülheim / Essen there was a fatal accident on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider crashed on the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed in the crash.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
At the time of the accident, the plane was already on its approach to land.
The crash site is not far from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim / Essen Airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the entrance to the 52nd motorway.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump idolizes Kim: 'And then we fell in love'
It is no secret that the US President is sympathetic to North Korea's leader Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a veritable declaration of love for his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has announced his engagement to a new flame.
The tragedy is that it is a long-distance relationship.
Donald Trump made an unusual public declaration of love for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
Addressing supporters in West Virginia, Trump offered almost affectionate words for the half-old scion of Pyongyang's ruling dynasty, even though he is proving to be a tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
'I was tough, so was he, and it went back and forth between us, 'Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it wasn't just the talks with Kim that melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announcement that all nuclear and missile tests would be halted, even though critics have so far paid little more than lip service to it.
The US president seemed well aware that not everyone is likely to feel affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - infamous for his bellicose threatening gestures.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism when he appeared at a major gymnasium in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so unpresidential.
But he didn't care, Trump said, pointing his index finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there crowding into this packed arena, we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Perfectly visited, atmospheric and also spoiled by the sun: Very varied and with a good dash of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre was dressed up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the marquee at the fire station, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to highlight their dire conditions in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the footage in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July and circulated it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers," whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
He said the video put his life in danger.
One of his comrades was beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year under the program, said Jorge Galindo, an IOM spokesman in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he said he had not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organisations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her class for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4: 50 p.m., the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the antechamber of the first floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who started the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether items or money were stolen.
Description of the perpetrator: approx. 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the police inspection Obernberg am Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man has had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a wooded area in central Franconia after he got stuck off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers discovered the car by chance near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the man, who had been missing since Tuesday evening, police said Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was said to be in good health despite the cold nights and long periods without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner was reported missing by his family after failing to return from a drive in his SUV through the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after meeting Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This applies in particular to waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
Laschet also mentioned, according to his own information, the cases of Germans imprisoned in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then reaffirmed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense's flight readiness at Cologne airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the talks, Erdogan traveled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are their point of contact - not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the success of negotiations to denuclearize North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a concession from Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent stalemate comes because the U.S. is relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."
To build confidence, however, his country halted its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test site, Ri said.
However, there was no "corresponding reaction" from the US side, the minister criticised.
North Korea's nuclear and missile programs prompted the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations in recent days for strict adherence to the punitive measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang in October for talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the House of Open Doors HoT did not notice: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the meal.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: A power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: Although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," says Westbuer.
And so everyone got involved.
The result was impressive, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Chefs couldn't do it any better," praised one impressed visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to help themselves to quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have done," said Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed the audience with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW board of directors of Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism from the own ranks the boss of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, left his post in the regional association.
Sartor had become known throughout Germany because the Essen Tafel had introduced an admission ban for foreigners.
Sartor told "Welt am Sonntag" that he had already resigned as deputy chief of the NRW tablets in July.
Too many have been stabbed in the back.
The head of the North Rhine-Westphalia Panels Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, told dpa that he understood the decision of his long-time deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his move - there have been people who have expressed themselves who did not know exactly why the Essen table is doing this."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels in the "Welt am Sonntag."
"Without us, the people of the city will starve to death," he said.
It was the duty of the state to ensure that people did not starve to death.
The man from Essen did not take part in a congress of the plaques on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet mustard being told to me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who criticised me at the time.
SF Lorch squander 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Lorch loses against newcomers 2: 3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a deficit - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2: 0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home match against the TV newcomer - in the end it was 2: 3 and the disappointment among sports fans was great.
Completely differently the TV hypochondriacs: In Kirchheim the TVH came fast with 0: 1 into the lag, won after 90 minutes however with 2: 1. At the top of the table the SGB could meanwhile with a 3: 0
Gladbach squander two-goal lead as Schalke secure first win without Embolo
Borussia Monchengladbach will have to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2-2, the Foals squandered a two-run lead.
Schalke is coming off its first win of the season against Mainz (1-0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league games Schalke manoeuvred itself offside with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco showed again the strength, with which it had occupied the first place behind the Bavarians last season.
Alessandro Schöpf gave the home team the lead in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka. Subsequently, the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund is now welcoming from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had trailed 0-2 against Bayer Leverkusen before the break, but managed to win 4-2 in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalized with a double inside four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break with another double in the closing stages (86th / 94th).
VfB Stuttgart also won for the first time.
Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, had to worry in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in own goal, which helped the guests to the equaliser in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led VfB to their first victory.
At Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Monchengladbach.
Together with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, the team from Gladbach gave up the lead twice, ultimately played 2: 2 and are still waiting for an away win in the VW town since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's equaliser in the 1-1 draw with his second Bundesliga goal.
Yann Sommer was powerless when he fired in a low shot from 20 yards, as was the case with the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite auspicious.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalgetter in the foal storm.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from OGC Nice scored for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory match.
After seven rounds Gladbach occupies the 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered itself into an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes Florian Kohlfeldt's team let themselves be surprised by a Stuttgart counter attack, which the ex-Luganese Anastasios Donis closed with his first goal of the season. After 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic added to his team: The 23-year-old Serb received yellow-red after a shirt tug against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought Bremen back into the game with a curious throw-in own goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot Stuttgart back on the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the duel against Dusseldorf 3: 0.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens put the home team on course with a foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether to change their country's name to Northern Macedonia.
A Yes vote could resolve the nearly three decades of simmering conflict with neighbor Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its eponymous northern province and blocked any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West.
Voters therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The United States had announced that, if the referendum was positive, the country could quickly become a member of NATO.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners, injuring some of them severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund at around 10pm on Friday.
When the police arrived, they confronted the suspect about his behaviour, who attacked passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them.
The Syrian then tried to hit and kick the officers.
Shortly afterwards it turned out that the suspect had just hit three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground at a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
He had also trampled on the trio.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for reasons as yet unknown," police said.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
Kahrs, 55, is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative wing of the SPD.
On 30 June 2017, Kahrs caused a stir with a furious speech in the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to adoption rights.
Garden day: 400 metres hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the civic association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus were to be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, chairman of the civic association.
And a lot of things have accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now only a shape cut.
The hedgerow had already been shaved in the spring.
Breakfast, which always follows work, also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championships
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg has won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put on a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago he missed out on Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I've had enough rides here on the track and everything was perfect today, "said the London 2012 Olympic third place finisher.
At the finish, he threw his paddle away in joy and raised both arms in the air in victory - knowing that at least one medal would be enough.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six starters who remained could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Czech rider Jiri Prskavec finished second ahead of Russian Pawel Eigel.
Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary of a family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the culprits failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of this again.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate yesterday reported the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the single-family house on the Königswieser Straße, is thanks to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators set off shortly before 8pm on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
But the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Information to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Hertha bust: Reality catches up with Bayern against Ajax
The title of unbeatable is gone: the FC Bayern "will not put up with" the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach determine the first interim conclusion for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small dip in performance under new coach Niko Kovac should not be a major fall-out for the Munich side.
"A week ago, we still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us a little bit, "Thomas Müller stated after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are stepping on the gas on Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year no own goal scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two obligatory games in a row without a win, the championship lead in the Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is nowhere near as dramatic as at the end of September 2017, when Carlo Ancelotti failed, the record-breaking manager must still be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with their intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful pinpricks over the outfield provided two blueprints within three days on how to beat the last overpowering Bavarians.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not put up with this and that we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his hometown, blaming his first defeat as Munich coach only on the once again poor handling of chances.
Victories against Amsterdam and Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim conclusion of his tenure positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to intensify.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before his second Premier League appearance of the season after the 2-0 defeat at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins as planned, which also defeated AEK Athens confidently with 3: 0 at the start.
'Now we've got two games to go, but we will score again, 'announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Joshua Kimmich, in particular, spoke plainly, as he did after losing the cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same venue.
The lawyer acted in the role of admonisher.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of the previous season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a one-point advantage.
Kimmich, with a twinkle in his eye, was at least pleased that the public debate around the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has now come to an end.
"Yeah, that's good," the international said.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the sovereignty of interpretation in the long-running dispute over Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the treatment of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the head of the DFB defended the association's line.
Early on Sunday morning Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the incident in Mainz's ZDF "sports studio."
"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migration background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that this kind of thing will not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to recruit a national team player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gundogan, born and raised in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
To be honest, as its President, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were marginalised.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "treated sensibly by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would introduce himself to players in the future.
For someone to say: if I win, I am German; if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration commissioner will now be appointed in addition to the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a significant impact on society and football and says:" The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism levelled at him after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he intends to run for president of the DFB again next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents in three hours
Coburg / Rödental - Police say the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10am and 1pm on Friday.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner he had hit her car.
There was no change of personnel, however, as the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a motorist who had strayed off the road and hit a guard post.
Asked about it, the man did not want police on the scene and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner got lost in his home, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Eventually the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car was clearly damaged in the accident.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage amounts to approximately 1300 euros.
Moorland fire in Meppen: Still nearly 1000 firefighters in action.
Approximately four weeks after the outbreak of the moorland fire on a military site in the Emsland, 980 firefighters are still busy with the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to stabilize, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it said.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster, which had been declared just over a week earlier on 21 September, was lifted because of fears that the flames, caused by wind and flying sparks, would endanger adjacent forests and settlements.
On Thursday, it said there was no threat of the fire spreading to adjacent communities.
At times, more than 1,500 firefighters tried to get the blaze under control.
The Luftwaffe is continuing to support the work at the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was sparked by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The plume of smoke from the moorland fire was at times up to a hundred kilometres far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
When we get married, that's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
Kahrs, 55, is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative wing of the SPD.
On 30 June 2017, Kahrs caused a stir with a furious speech in the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with regard to adoption rights.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state name
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in future.
Neighboring Greece insists on this because of its northern province of the same name.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO as a means of exerting pressure.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the go-ahead for their country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in the United States in 2016, leaving behind a body of work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still only be removed with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(AP) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who wish to donate their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may still be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of cases is a card found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very distressing," he said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
Under his proposal, anyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or his relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old schoolboy is world champion in head maths
Tomohiro Iseda, a 14-year-old student from Japan, is the world champion in head arithmetic.
He beat 39 competitors at the weekend in Wolfsburg.
Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced the news on Sunday.
Sixteen-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese schoolboy, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, according to head referee Ralf Laue.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old at the time.
Laue can do little with terms such as superbrain, genius or child prodigy.
"Mental arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced for several hours a day.
There are even stadium-based arithmetic contests in India or Singapore.
The disciplines include, for example, square rooting from six-digit numbers.
In versatility calculations, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
"The Germans have a good chance here," said the chief referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because they learn mental arithmetic more intensively and with other, effective methods already in early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video featuring naked Serena Williams: It's all about breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams is showing off her soulful and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to raise awareness of breast cancer and advocate for early detection.
It is a matter of life and death, but also of courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings topless the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which focuses on breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams nearly died herself a year ago.
There were complications with the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency operation was launched to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT scan revealed blood clots in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the coalition will send a bill on the so-called "symbols law" into consideration.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Next week, Frau Holle will shake out her beds for the first time in the West: Polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, snow can fall down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it was reported.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow is to be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher mountain pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner High Alpine Road), the road conditions are therefore wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start annual grooming on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The "green ramparts," which are unique in Germany, have characterised the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for around 200 years.
The tree and scrub hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are a "substitute for the forest" and the last refuge for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the Nature Conservation Association of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
The name "Knick" also dates back to that time: by "bending" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations were able to develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the impression of a woody, varied landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7,000 animal species.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of crease and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is cared for appropriately in winter.
Otherwise it atrophies to a light row of trees, which loses not only the biodiversity but also the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
Indonesian man speaks out after Sulawesi tsunami
In an interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have set up a temporary shelter for other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still hold out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are outside their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The civil service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, some of the prisoners walk around freely and the search for them is difficult.
Many bodies are still lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
What is the communication and information system on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it did not work and we got information only over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know if they live or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and we also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart for a long time with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo suffered a torn muscle fibre in the back of his left thigh in the 2-1 win over Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga club announced on Sunday.
The doctors diagnosed Donis with a torn muscle bundle in his thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches after the international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a prognosis on the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes the annual round of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the farewells to cinema, 2018 has been a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes with strong entries from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar nominees from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning the Olching fire brigade tried to catch an injured duck.
The action, however, dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - A white, injured duck caught the attention of walkers on Lake Olching on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water watch station.
Passers-by called the police and fire brigade to help the animal.
The first attempts to catch the duck, however, went awry.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the emergency services time and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box by a firefighter with a brave handle after almost an hour.
The duck, who was injured in the chest, was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Oberschleissheim.
But, according to initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard targets World Championship medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was long in the stomach of biathlete Julian Eberhard.
Next winter, the man from Saalfelden wants to make up for the precious metal he missed out on at the World Championships in Östersund.
The final shot cost the 31-year-old his medal in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint.
Seven-tenths of a second off bronze in the end.
"I deliberately took my time to process this," Eberhard says at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in great shape, but it just wasn't to be.
The Pinzgau native is all the more motivated to make up for the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to return to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
The World Championship track in Östersund (SWE) is in Eberhard's hands: "I have already taken the track to my heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) last World Cup winter.
He ran the relay in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in turmoil
Time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is very limited.
Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is under investigation by the FBI over allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents, which date back more than 30 years.
The latest twist in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appointment, which has been dogged by a culture war, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing between Kavanaugh and the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer launched angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was supposed to clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake announced, contrary to his original announcement, that he would vote yes but demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party colleagues agreed.
President Trump, who on Thursday called the allegations "shit," initially refrained from further attacks on the women, instead calling them "luck in misfortune."
In this way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at a campaign rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for opposing Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI probe into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators.
A government official told the Wall Street Journal that the two women's allegations will be investigated, but nothing more: "They're not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are scheduled to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civilian vehicle" belonging to the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
This is also where the Bundesschulzentrum is located.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You could feel the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
There is a great sense of relief at Schalke after their first win of the season.
Nevertheless, against Mainz, the factor of time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - By now it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
It was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
'I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area, "said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
In the end, the royal blue managed to get the narrow 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under wraps.
In fact, things could have turned out very differently.
After Alessandro Schöpf's 11th-minute header gave head coach Domenico Tedesco's team some security, Tedesco said: "Overall, the first half was good, both in terms of play and pressing."
Don't create a header monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said. "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to let it get out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who played no insignificant part in this with his header goal: "I am actually the worst header player in the team."
But in the end, all that matters is victory.
The relief was palpable throughout the arena, including Tedesco, of course.
"We wanted to start strongly in the early stages and make fireworks out of it," Schalke's head coach said.
The win was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest flaw of the afternoon: Royal Blue failed to provide for clearer conditions.
The opportunities were there, such as the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice, or Amine Harit, who hit the bar twice.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shock win," Tedesco said, "you could feel the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalke player.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was unmistakable.
Around two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal valley observed a fire at around 1.30pm on Sunday.
Police are now investigating.
Fischbachau - The police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: An unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two square metre area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared he had been monitoring the fire for some time, but then left the embers unattended.
And this close to the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing the fire.
Police are now investigating the blaze.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of them stands the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"For many years, I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani starts the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, solid figures and the odd joke, he brings one of the most conflicting topics closer to the audience: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise more and more despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table sits German society, at the other the first generation of migrants.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have their say.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, the decisive question is not whether one belongs to the political right or the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?," he stresses.
At first rather subdued, then more and more lively the discussion starts.
And there is a need for debate.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with pupils.
El-Mafaalani presides, not on the stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is on an equal footing.
The professor of sociology does not impose his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he still had an open ear for the guests "questions, and there was also intensive discussion in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening matches
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn finished the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen prevailed 91: 84 (43: 46) against the Mitteldeutsche BC in a hard-fought match in its own hall.
The ambitious Bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86: 79 (49: 47).
The first league leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112: 55 Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former serial champion Brose Bamberg had considerably more trouble.
Munich already struggled to an 83: 77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84: 80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: Over 100 prospective buyers applied for the purchase of one of the properties in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new development area Landsham-Süd on the open market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick is telling us.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality on more favourable terms and prices has been completed - similar to the previous local model.
According to Frick, a good 100 applications have been received.
"Documents are currently being reviewed," in terms of application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have drawn up the candidate ranking list for the 20 properties by the end of the year and to present it to the local council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses, each of which is expected to comprise eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot and two of the apartment buildings belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments subsidised by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated is the area of the new development area Landsham-Süd housing for about 200 people created.
Not only that: According to Frick, the start of construction of a new day care center will take place there at the beginning of October.
It will house three kindergarten groups and three crèches, as well as a multi-purpose room.
It is scheduled to open in September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalke's Naldo 'great sport' succeeds on the bench
Not in the starting line-up for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalke starting line-up, but on the substitution bench, the understanding with many people would have been great, if the almost two meter tall Brazilian would have spoken his frustration from his soul.
But when the Schalke players gathered in the centre circle as usual after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who everyone simply calls Naldo, stepped in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was great sport," Tedesco said later of the reaction of his vice-captain, who held no grudges despite being a reserve again.
It is probable that Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalke player last season, knows that he has actually not been sidelined by his coach - but is getting a break for good reason.
One reason is called "stress management."
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll be honest with you," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo he wasn't in the starting line-up.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club, "Tedesco said of the move.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36.
It is important that everyone can breathe a sigh of relief at the moment.
And that we keep everybody in the boat, "Tedesco said of the rotation, which also recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself an exemplary team player even on the bench.
Sentiment in Austria's industry continued its downward slide relative to the eurozone in August.
The purchasing managers "index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third-best sentiment in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute reported on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the euro zone PMI rose 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50-point mark for the 13th month in a row, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke that threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Last were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, but more slowly than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March at 44.0 points.
"The slight slowdown may mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one drag on growth - at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell at their fastest pace since November 2011.
Companies cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more sharply in August than initially thought.
The sentiment barometer fell to 47.6 points from 49.3 points the previous month.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Developments in turnover, employment, warehousing and prices will be investigated, among other things.
Tuchel's PSG team secure eighth win in eight league games
September 29, 2018 - 7: 45PM
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel is rushing from one victory to the next with Paris Saint-Germain in the French Cup.
Thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar, the defending champions won 3-0 (1-0) at the OGC Nice and were also successful in their eighth league game.
Olympique Lyon last made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar gave PSG the lead after 22 minutes and added the final score in injury time.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) made it 2-0.
It also provided Paris with a dress rehearsal for the ground-breaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the Premier League season Tuchel's team suffered their only defeat of the season so far in the 2-3 draw at Liverpool.
