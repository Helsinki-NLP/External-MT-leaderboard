Not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already well accepted, but it also offers details that aren't so often found in fossils, like colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was clear or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs, known as raches, do not have a well-developed stem but have other features, such as claws and barbels.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather to display or regulate temperature. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not a pup.
The researchers suggested that although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the sample revealed adult plumage, not a penughen.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected the attacker was an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant.
They discovered that the sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was determined by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter in the vicinity of a galaxy is located in the vicinity of a galaxy in a sort of halo and is composed of several tiny particles.
Television reports report the whitish smoke coming out of the plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He warned that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the high mortality rate", in an interview.
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital and at least two were health care professionals.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with TB still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a group of 330,000 individuals infected at any one time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that the temperature variations from night to day indicate that they are probably caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and hotter at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on planet Earth, which tend to maintain a very constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are very deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officers verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law codifies the procedures in a very strict manner.
Since 1988, polling stations have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process.

The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said.
Although three people were inside the house when she was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court ever since, charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system acts differently, and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be heading in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in general charge of the proceedings, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six Day War in 1967.
Other subjects covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test were under close supervision by forestry engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, according to the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Park Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunt operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEO in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the general protests organised against the regime, which began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 0719 local time, which is Friday, 0919 GMT.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there was no damage reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Although working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extremes. My first businesswoman. Luna died in a night with two moons. Something exceptional, like her. Strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more... I loved her and will miss her... if she were in a better place".
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposed to Australia's move to become a republic has risen by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 national election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia's last monarch.
At the poll's extreme, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three relay at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was put into question.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, since these are prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25.
Several people proved the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of water distribution to the earth along with organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politics and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and no surface trains will stop at Wembley, parking and public transport connections will be unavailable.
The problem of lack of transport increased the possibility of the game having to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migrating finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape, even rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched to form a thin thread, and can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and glued to another metal, and because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make a marker using purple cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together and, with clean hands, mold them into a ball shape.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet seat with drainage in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnants of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public toilets, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and various other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat smaller, much more numerous animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat performs that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males of the same family, along with up to 30 females and cubs.
Women are often closely related to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and owl. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion's every voice, but more like a phrase of shouted and growled words.
The jaguars like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the jaguars hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that jaguars follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they've been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and they can also move stealthily. Jaguars hunt their prey by mixing with their surroundings and then attack their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from that in which they had previously lived.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from the ones it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses using plants, we make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we consume is plants. Without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its age, so the only thing he feared were other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were clawed with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of the mouth, showing that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not be his equal.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called the arganaz
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides while they made their meals.
The diet in ancient Rome did not include foods imported from America and Asia to Europe, as happened in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of their respective god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of those gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home wasn't that important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outside.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just open counters facing the street, stones were used in building houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled, and in Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and on his journey west, he found Greenland and gave it his name.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The Legend of Lost Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large, meaningful group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
The city-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization implies the passing on of knowledge by different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a just dissemination.
Smaller cultures often die without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress being its sole component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were generally uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skating and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipel"
The founding of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named the place Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a base in southwest Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings within the complex's boundaries have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they were like originally.
By the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
For example, the most common form of still photography on the planet is 35mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually confusingly 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the smallest ratio between whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The much abused and often demoralized third-party law is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining relative order in a figure.
He believes that the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by its influence, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, with the cutting off of vital supplies to military and civilian personnel, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international regulations and has been provided for in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to ships flying neutral flags.
Germany, since there was a limited response to this tactic, expected an attack similar to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States penniless, with no poems and no letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the boss of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, post-Revolutionary vacancies were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since instead of patents being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the times, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it, even if you know it exists.
You can't see anything but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Gizza Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, features several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and relatives of Khufu.
The "upward-pointing arch" mark has its similar appearance with a V, and the "downward-pointing arch mark" has its similar appearance with a clasp or a square without the bottom side.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow; bottom means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
Generally, an upward arch produces a softer sound, while a downward arch produces a louder, assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, his two young children (Mary Theresa, eleven, and Louis Charles, four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris, departing from Versailles, by a crowd of women from the markets.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on floating rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
It is clear that the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Lower Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a range of ideas in practice, from the provision of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: first, that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; second, the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health care system to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be shaped and, over time, the customs and culture associated with that geography to emerge, which, being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the eventually mandatory laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic language reached its peak in the 10th-11th centuries and again in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, because of slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest advances for the time was that as a result of the Crusades, people began using buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to turn to the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Some of these children have been confined by people (usually by the parents themselves); in some cases, the abandonment of this child has been due to the rejection of the child by the parents because of his or her severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are bullied may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the wild child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the particular pet, such as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little talking clip from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software to question, alert and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a myriad of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care and educate, but it does.
We see the foster system as a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption platform is charged with providing safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
Adoption care is supposed to meet all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
 Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can detect whether another person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately evaluate sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the grouping of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to meet its requirements for amino acids.
Moreover, failure to act leads to serious consequences - severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant-based resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they're hard for us primates to digest unless they're cooked.
However, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" much like the modern savannah chimpanzees do.
Sleep interruption is a process that involves deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a semi-still alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up at all.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed across the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on the biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace correlates oppositely with his level of physical and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that gets in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, the shocks of systems, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years, and, in fact, there would be leadership of reserve troops on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, as more than 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that its country maintains the ability to move people and goods while at the same time interfering with its enemies' ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the North Atlantic of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval organization, using mostly U-boats, was trying to stamp out this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the ability to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the best-known shepherd.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on slightly more bumpy roads.
Dormers were implemented early on to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if they had a metal coating on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, was not standing upright as usual.
Bipedal adaptations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, however, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want to have a temporary solution, we have to find the root cause of the problems and get rid of them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of man's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After passing by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to a printer by John Dunlap.
Overnight, about 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap seizures that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The strongest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects structured enough to stick to humans.
Both barbers and bedbugs are nesting, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young people and adults
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest, or that of their child.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It's not, in fact, just an experiment; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek receded, the West found itself far removed from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various observed rhythms in physiology and behavior normally depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are absolutely not responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a continuous period of cycle, even without environmental interference.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that either tagged the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting areas of nature with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small towns in the countryside to work in other cities, and they meet other people who work in the very small towns they came from.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a transport system based on private cars.
Science now points out that this carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to flee enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and fleas.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes nearly 10 kilometers wide.
A total of 20 percent of the water that goes from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and in technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, who were by then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people, it's the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can all be found in nature in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Lye is simply a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
You also get alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
All things in the universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so amazingly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit in the endpoint of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important paper and use.
Today, people text on computer screens without having to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's more like driving a heavy cart up a hill, and the split of the nucleus again, then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There might be more lava on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what is in certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Theory of the Two Factors.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former co-workers. One side of the spectrum tries to remain "part of the guys' (or girls') group".
Such a manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that you have to change everything the team has done and do your own thing.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as teams considered conventional, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members usually act as the point of contact for your immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional staff members, as their teams may meet in varying time zones, which may not be understood by local managers.
The presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member must report.
Why would an organisation want to go through the difficult process of establishing an organisational learning? One of the practical objectives of organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity shine through.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's need.
Even before an organization can innovate, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, so it narrows the research area and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavioral pathology is thrilling scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to attend to customer questions and diagnoses, as well as handwriting, voice and speech recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it is integrated into various home computer and video game software applications.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field classes, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is remodeled, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a memoir.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, since students often start their interaction with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, so the presence of an audience often changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the public's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with Internet content in an active way, students can place themselves in the context of others' writings as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south; the north has the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Because of all this and more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also fairly sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, a distance from the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent in its own right, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach hotels.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which gained much popularity in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all travelers state that they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men. Don't be afraid to be firm (be it cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean everything is fine!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Mennonites as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historic part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of other trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be studied to understand the state of the battle that persists in the province of Nord-Kivu.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest gorilla mountain trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motor taxi) to stroll around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a quick stroll.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for distant and exotic lands, given their relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World program, broadcast on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park is in the northeast of South Africa, along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entrance and conservation of the park, as with all South African national parks.
It can also be very useful to acquire a Wild Card, which gives you access to several South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as their main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a shimmering bar chart made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists chose to live, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove belt, extending for 80 km (50 mi) inland from Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great forests that have ever covered the remaining Gangetic surface.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, one third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer sighted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are almost always full, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and two runways of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011 and it did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to enter service in September 2017, the date for which customs inspections in Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in preserving many of its indigenous peoples' characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To stay up to date on tournaments and where to buy tickets to polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and credit cards and U.S. dollars are accepted at Stanley.
In remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted.
It is virtually impossible to change the current currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so change the currency before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely get below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the park authorities' instructions, stay at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves, and 25 yards per meter from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk, and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they didn't keep a proper distance.
Also, know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, but avoid carrying or cooking food with a strong smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 German and American lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is between two coves. The most popular are in three areas.
The northern coastline (in the North Harbour district) is washed by the Pacific Ocean and runs from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shadows from the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the sophisticated suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the central Auckland region.
These are sometimes family beaches crowded with a wide variety of shops around the coast.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not an elaborate beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can go down better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're afraid.
For Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is strange: a short black coffee is "espresso", the cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard, natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made year-round, and injuries from any of these causes that occur on the reef are rare.
Continue to heed the authorities' reminders, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cubedosa occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, 1770 in the north.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, but their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often do business with specific hotels, although it is likely that other types of accommodation, such as camping parks, can be booked by a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even package combinations with flights and hotels.
They can also guarantee your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have any change or request, it should first be forwarded to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp out on the spot, and most of them consider this a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to the action, you'll have to get there early to get camping near the music.
Remember that even after the music closes on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue to play late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, for crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include sightseeing in the city.
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them in place.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of keeping sober.
Whenever one is driving in places with high latitudes or on roads over mountains, one should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to trap you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and a favorite of many visitors.
The term "safari", in its colloquial usage, refers to overland trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and basic equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "walking in the woods", "walking safari", or "pasada", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021.[1] Some events will be hosted in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you've booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but in late March most of the coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with normal tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have iron and iron boards for loans, even if there is no iron in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like wearing worn-out socks, you may try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the tissue (which may cause it to shrink or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of filters varies, and if you are in doubt, it may be a good idea to consider buying gallons of water from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they are not familiar with in the regions from which they came.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, who often pass through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not in the habit of driving on inland roads, be wise: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The advertised speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections - commonly 55-65 km/h - and strict compliance with them is even more important than the reverse.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good, and in Bavaria they are very capricious and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit sweets are recurring, with apples baked in the sweets all year round, and cherries and plums making a mark during the summer.
Many German bakeries also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The famous cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in Southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But when used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of dishes seasoned in a simple manner, the predominant spices of Javanese preference being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
To support a rider's feet, straps are used, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may present safety problems, as the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal eventually escapes.
First, a large proportion of pilots wear riding boots with a slippery, smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Then some seals, especially English seals, have safety bars that allow a leather strap to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Being Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
The meetings include exciting views of the peaks. Alpinists from all over the world are continually establishing new routes among their endless potential of ramparts.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding across snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard board attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity in the journey for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations just to ski at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski team was opened by Norwegian citizens in Australia.
Skiing: an activity also known as backcountry skiing, hiking skiing or ski-climbing.
It is related, but generally does not involve tourism for alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover distances slightly larger than on foot  but only very rarely will you achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, operates as a country in this respect.
If you stay in that area, you can cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen area member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sami, and the culture around trade is also important for many other professional classes.
Although it is a tradition, not all Sami people have engaged in large-scale reindeer farming, but they have lived by fishing, hunting and the like, having reindeer as mainly traction animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about Roma people.

When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, one should first receive professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile Environment Course' will usually give you the address of a company in the area.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves dramatization, various first aid and sometimes training in the use of weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with jungle survival are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning sex-change surgery abroad should ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an undefined gender (X), or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies widely.
Security checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had gender reassignment surgery should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Backflow is the backflow of water from waves on the beach back to the sea, usually on a reef or similar area.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a rapid deep-water current can form there.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it would normally be.
Try aiming from somewhere where you cannot be caught or, depending on your skills or if you have been spotted, wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs before culture shock (it occurs less honeymoon time), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People don't realize that patience and understanding are also essential for travelers returning home.
In the children's area, one of the most interesting things is the light and sound show of the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors.

The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active by 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the village of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula Mountains here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 200-mile-long Ellsworth Mountain chain, cut by the glacier of Minnesota.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892 m (14,070 ft) at Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational craft, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator can provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who intend to take a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who leave school, allowing them to take a year before university without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can indeed increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
There will normally be a fee to enroll in these educational programmes.
For boaters, Finland is a great destination. In the lakes and coastal archipelagoes, the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands.
In the archipelago and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in a rather characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two whole days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you are only embarking on sea trips, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, on their flyers. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have never experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome fear of the unknown or of not being in control.
Freight companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often time is very important in sending out commercial documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they're air-shipping things, depending on the route, it could take days to get to the landing and through customs.
The only way to get through was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you get in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a large amount of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economy rate for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it is not even worth looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic relations were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not damage the site by staining or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.
However, most of the plates are only in Catalan, because this is the language that has been established by law as an official language.

The Parisian's rough exterior will quickly fade, if you show some basic courtesy
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mostly with beech, spruce, and pine, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to the varied microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude.

Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and tetras, as well as several other common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering their knees and must also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide costumes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own costumes, especially brightly colored ones, you will be greeted with a monk's or nun's smile.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants covering their knees.
You can borrow clothes at the entrance, but they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
The cuisine of Majorca, as well as that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any ingredients available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "you", always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, no doubt, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used substantially.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they were written.
The main letters to note are C and G, as their pronunciation varies according to the following vowel.

However, people who speak some Spanish may hastily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not a problem, they are usually found in cities or university campuses, which are easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.

Most traditional churches usually hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you're visiting the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you're going to experience the polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the northern lights, for the sky gets dark at about the right time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and consequently light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
In Japan, cultural labor relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are accustomed to seeing.
Suits are the standard business outfit, and coworkers call each other by their surnames or titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than individual achievement.
