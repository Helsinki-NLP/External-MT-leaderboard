Accumulative incidence of new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased rapidly between 1 January 2020 and 15 March 2020 in the EU/EEA and the UK
Accumulative incidence rates of new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in different countries of the European Economic Area and the UK show similar trends, confirming the rapid development of the COVID-19 epidemic, although at different stages in different countries.
According to Italian experience, the state, hospitals and emergency care centers need to be better prepared to meet the rising number of COVID-19 patients.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of unknown cause of pneumonia were in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the pathogen is a new type of coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence so far suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 cases are mild, i.e. accompanied by or without pneumonia, and most are recoverable.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to severe and requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% progresses to severe and requires severe care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we evaluated the trends in COVID-19 accumulation rates in different countries in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/European Economic Area, EEA) and the UK (UK) and compared them with Hubei Province in China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy between January 31 and March 15.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Following China, the geographical distribution of COVID-19 has expanded further, and the current dynamics of COVID-19 pandemics in other parts of the world are similar to those in China.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a major epidemic.
In the European Monitor, published on March 5, 2020, Spiteri and others the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe based on the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, France the first three confirmed cases on 24 January 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have detected cases of COVID-19, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between 31 December and 15 March 2019, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Acquisition of cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centers for Disease Control and Control (ECDC) updates the number of cases of COVID-19 in each country every morning at 8:00 p.m. and is available only from official sources, such as national health ministries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO.
These data have been used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and have been compared with Italy.
We calculated the 14-day cumulative incidence rate for COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020 as an indicator of the incidence rate for active COVID-19 cases in order to take into account the natural course of COVID-19.
We also provided the total cumulative number of cases by 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020 for each country, and compared with data for Italy from January 31, 2020 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of crossing the 14 day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK is generally consistent with that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21, 2020, and then increased sharply around February 28.
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar growth trend for COVID-19 accumulation.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK between January 31 and March 15, 2020, and compares it with Italy.
It should be noted that as of 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had a total number of cases equivalent to that of Italy in less than three weeks.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK is growing rapidly.
Observed trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicate that the outbreak is developing at a similar rate in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, national public health response measures vary, cases may be defined differently, and patients may be selected for confirmation testing for COVID-19 – including additional testing – with different schemes, but the same situation.
By early March 2020, according to doctors in the affected regions of Italy, approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients would need severe care, while media reports that hospitals and severe care rooms in these areas had reached their maximum load.
At the EU/EEA level, currently available data are only 6% and 1% of cases of COVID-19 hospitalized/entered in critical care facilities, respectively (data is not shown).
However, this information should be collected in a systematic way to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there were significant differences between the number of beds available in serious care and mid-term care across Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 owners in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (in 2010-2011 there were 12.5 beds for severe and medium-term care for every 100,000 people).
ECDC’s sixth update of the COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment modeled healthcare saturation-related scenarios and estimated the relationship between the incidence rate of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in each EU/EEA country and the UK and the risk of more than 90% of heavy care beds.
Since cases have so far been concentrated in EU/EEA countries and certain regions of the UK, and hospitals and emergency care centers typically provide services to determine the population coverage of the region, it is best to provide information on cases and emergency care beds at Standard Geographic Unit 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experience in Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEA and the UK is developing rapidly.
Therefore, nations, hospitals and emergency care centers should be prepared to respond to the ongoing spread of SARS-CoV-2 in communities and to the increased number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care, especially those in serious care, such as those in the affected regions of Italy.
As the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment points out, fast, proactive and comprehensive approaches are critical to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2 and require a transition from containment to mitigation, as the rapid increase in the number of cases expected without early implementation may leave policy makers and hospitals not enough time to understand, accept and adjust responses.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a short window of opportunity, and countries can use it to further increase control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare systems.
Otherwise, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge in patients in need of serious care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing more than 3,000 deaths, causing enormous human disasters.
Similar to its homogen SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by butterflies and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, it is more transmissible and affects older people than younger people and more men than women.
Given the rapid increase in new coronary pneumonia-related publications, this article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of this rapidly developing research topic.
We will introduce basic knowledge about the disease’s epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate this terrible disease.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, has become an unprecedented and heartfelt memory for Chinese people, with the outbreak of a new type of viral disease forcing everyone to stay out of the house throughout the holidays and several weeks thereafter.
The virus is highly homogeneous to the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2, a related disease known as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country, then spread to 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which more than 40,000 patients have been hospitalized and more than 3,000 patients have died.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 has become the “public enemy number one” whose threat may outweigh terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) more than 200 papers on COVID-19 have been published in less than two months since the first report on the isolation of viral sequences from multiple patients on 7 January 2020, covering virology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment.
This article aims to summarize research progress in this emerging field of discipline.
It is customary to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss the knowledge learned so far about the disease’s prevention and prognosis, as well as some of the pressing issues that remain to be addressed.
In the past, CoV has been thought to be a non-fatal pathogen for humans, causing about 15% of common colds.
But this century has encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which broke out in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries, with terrifying incidence and mortality.
As a result, the COVID-19 outbreak is the third recorded outbreak of CoV in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the city of Wuhan first several cases of unknown causes of pneumonia to the National Health and Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan the first deaths.
Meanwhile, the outbreak spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, medical personnel the infection, suggesting the possibility of human transmission.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed and all public transportation was closed.
On January 24, a first clinical trial on coronary pneumonia that of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with Wuhan Southern Seafood Market, which is considered an unknown animal source of infection.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a “global health emergency”.
By the time this report was published, the disease had spread to China and 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
Due to the rapid development of the outbreak, the final extent and severity of the outbreak are still to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients (including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients) provided an updated description of the epidemic as shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 can infect people of all ages, but the main age group is between 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected are over the age of 50, a very small number are under the age of 20 and only 14 are under the age of 10.
More men (0,31/10 million) than women (0,27/10 million) were infected with SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 spreads mainly in the north and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons will increase indexally by January 23, 2020, matching the time of massive population movements before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the post-adjustment mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%)
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large membrane virus subfamily that contains single-justice chain RNA.
They can be divided into four families, α, β,γ and δ, of which α-CoV and β-CoV are known to infect humans.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV’s membrane turboproteins (S) bind to their cellular receptor vascular tension converter enzymes 2 (ACE2) and dihydrogen enzyme 4 (DPP4) and then membrane fusion occurs.
The virus RNA genome is released into the cell mass; after the virus genome is replicated, the genomic RNA with the membrane glucose protein and the nucleic shell protein forms a virus-containing bubble, then fuses with the membrane and releases the virus.
The first genome sequence for SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
The results found that SARS-CoV-2 was a new type of β-CoV, with a gene consistency of more than 99.98% of the 10 sequencing samples collected from the South China seafood market in Wuhan, where the outbreak originally occurred.
Compared to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV.
Through a radiological electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in the superthin slices of the upper skin of the respiratory tract.
The study found that human ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, compared to SARS-CoV, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is weaker binding to human ACE2, which coincides with the fact that the infection of patients with SARS-CoV-2 is less severe than that of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded by orf3b as well as secretive proteins encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however,orf8 does not contain any known functional structural domains or bases.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. the structure of the frozen electron microscope (cryo-EM) of the full adult ACE2 forming complex with the amino acid transfer protein B0AT1 at a resolution of 2.9 Å.
They found that the complex had an open and a closed composition, and was assembled into clusters, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins to provide evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may become a treatment target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate from butterflies and are transmitted to humans through fruit bears and camels, respectively.
By comparing the systemic development of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, butterflies are considered to be the natural host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% consistent with the two SARS-style CoVs from butterflies, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is unclear what intermediate hosts help the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and how it will spread remains to be clarified.
Ji and others suggested that snakes are virus carriers from butterflies to humans, which involves homogenic restructuring within S-protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, believe that given that a type of CoV found in a long-haired mole-eater, often used in Chinese medicine, has 99% gene synchronicity with SARS-CoV-2, it is believed to be a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes remains a huge difference; therefore, concrete evidence remains to provide decisive results (Fig. 33).
The chemistry of SARS-CoV-2 is largely unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and can survive for up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 isly sensitive to ultraviolet rays as well as heat — 56 °C for 30 minutes; ethanol, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectants, peroxide acetate, chlorimide and other lipid solvents can effectively kill the virus, but chlorine has not been determined to effectively kill the virus.
Humans generally lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to this new type of virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first identified by the host’s inherent immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type condensate receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Viruses induce inflammatory factor expression, tree mutilate cell maturity and type I interferon (IFN) synthesis through different pathways, which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the digestion of the virus antigen by the megaphage cells.
However, the N-protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus get rid of the immune response.
Adaptive immune responses will join the anti-virus ranks soon afterwards.
T lymph cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in antiviral defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, while CD8+ T cells directly kill the cells infected with the virus.
Auxiliary T cells produce inflammatory cell factors to help the above cells defend.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell death.
Immunity including supplements – such as C3a and C5a – and body fluids including antibodies are also crucial for resistance to viral infections.
For example, antibodies separated from recovered patients are able to neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system will locally produce large amounts of free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, lead to multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by aggregate onset, is more likely to affect elderly people with multiple complications, as well as pregnant women.
Typically, individuals who are exposed to a large number of viruses or immune impairments are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on a study of the earliest 425 cases in Wuhan, the average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned earlier, a recent study showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days according to the demographic statistics of 8,866 cases.
For the health sector, it is important to adjust effective isolation times to the most accurate incubation period, which prevents non-symptomatic people from spreading the virus to others.
As a rule, contacts with or infected with the virus are usually insulated for 14 days.
Should the isolation period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19 and can be accompanied by no other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, flu, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience difficulty breathing and/or low oxygenation within a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, it can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, thyrotoxic shock, metabolic acid poisoning, and blood clotting dysfunction.
Even in the absence of pulmonary imaging abnormalities, patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever should also undergo viral screening for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of various symptoms was: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, difficulty breathing 55%, diarrhea 3%; and 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Two recent studies on family cluster outbreaks and non-symptomatic individual spreads that led to cluster outbreaks similar findings.
By contrast, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and breathing difficulties (55%) as primary symptoms.
However, 80% of those patients needed respiratory support, far more than COVID-19 patients, which coincided with a higher mortality rate for MERS than for COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99 percent to 100 percent), dry cough (29 percent to 75 percent), difficulty breathing (40 percent to 42 percent), diarrhea (20 to 25 percent) and sore throat (13 to 25 percent) have been shown to be the primary symptoms, with approximately 14 percent to 20 percent of patients in need of respiratory support.
As of February 14, the worldwide confirmed cases of COVID-19 reached 66,576 cases, with a mortality rate of 2%.
By November 2002, SARS had a mortality rate of 10 percent in 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases was 37%.
An earlier study that R0 for SARS-CoV-2 had a confidence range of up to 6.47.95% (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 lists comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0.
The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 is more dispersive than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less fatal than the latter.
Therefore, control of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster outbreaks usually occur in the same family, or from the same gathering or means of transport, such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of traveling or residing in Wuhan or other outbreak areas within the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease, or have a history of close contact with infected persons or patients.
However, it is that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and healed patients who have been discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, thus issuing a warning of prolonged periods of isolation.
Patients had normal or decreased extracirculatory white blood cells (especially lymph cells) in the early stages of the disease.
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphatic reduction of white cell counts &lt; 4×109/L—including lymphatic counts &lt; 1×109/L—, elevated levels of cypionate-aminotransferase and viral hemorrhage were found.
Some patients have seen elevated levels of hepatic enzymes and mycoses in the blood, and most patients have seen elevated levels of C-react protein and blood clotting.
In severe patients, increased levels of D-dipolymeric products of blood fiber protein degradation and a decrease in lymphatic cell count were seen.
Most patients with COVID-19 have visible imaging abnormalities in the chest, which are characterized by bilateral plaque shadows or lungs mowing glass shadows.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive sexual fibrosis can seriously impair gas exchange.
Type I and type II epidermal dysfunctional disorders reduce surface activation levels and increase surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst breast imaging findings often occur simultaneously with the most severe degree of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease found the loss of pulmonary supercutaneous cells, the formation of transparent membranes, interstitial lymphatic immersion and polynuclear synthesis cells, consistent with the pathological manifestations of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criterion for diagnosing COVID-19.
However, as higher false-negative rates may accelerate the outbreak, China will begin diagnosing using clinical evidence on February 13, 2020 (rather than simply relying on RT-PCR).
Similar situations occurred when diagnosed with SARS.
Therefore, combining medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and imaging results is crucial for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Zhang Feng’s team a program for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology, which requires no complex instruments to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at concentrations of only 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 viral copies per microliter) in less than an hour.
If validated in clinical samples, this new technology is expected to significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of diagnosis.
Due to the lack of experience in treating new types of CoV, doctors primarily provide supportive therapy to patients with COVID-19 while attempting various therapies used or suggested for other CoVs — such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV — and other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments, such as antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma in recovered patients, drugs and psychological support.
It is even recommended that the plasma of recovered patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nonetheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat and cause of death for patients.
Therefore, respiratory support is critical to relieving symptoms and saving lives, including regular oxygen intake, high oxygen flow intake, non-traumatic aeration and traumatic mechanical aeration, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must receive support from ECMO, an improved cardiopulmonary sideway technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
Furthermore, maintenance of the electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of successive infections and hepatotoxic shocks, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is well known that excessive immune response in patients with SARS and MERS can lead to cell factor storms.
Cell factor storms are a form of inflammatory reactions characterized by the release of a range of cell factors, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cellular factors induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is a major cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is crucial in the treatment of cell-factor storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and pylori monoantibodies—an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody—have been used to treat cell factor storms.
Other immunosuppressive therapies aimed at cell factor storms include: regulation of T-cell-directed immune response; blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; Boner-Tuner resistance; cell factor signal transduction inhibitor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immunosuppressants are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, anaphylactic bone loss, which severely affects prognosis.
Nevertheless, short-term treatment with moderate and low doses of corticosteroids in patients at risk of COVID-19 is recommended with caution.
At the time of writing this article, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it has been found that Reddicev – a nucleic acid analogue – is effective for intravenous administration in one COVID-19 patient in the United States.
Reddit is a new type of antiviral drug developed by Gillette that was originally used to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, it was also demonstrated that Redsiv may inhibit other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
For these reasons, Gillette has supplied the drug to China for two clinical trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are expected.
Furthermore, the use of barecinine, alpha-interferon, lopinave/litonave and libavirin has been recommended as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after the combination treatment with lopinavir/litonavir.
Interactions between these treatments and other medicines used by the patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibodies produced in recovered patients
Patients recovering from infectious diseases have a long history of collecting blood for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from infecting the disease.
In fact, recovered patients usually contain relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immune globulin (Ig) produced by B lymphatic cells that are used to fight pathogens and other alien bodies, which can identify unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this principle, plasma was collected from a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and injected to 10 patients at risk.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral load and increased blood oxygen saturation.
However, prior to developing specific therapies, it is necessary to validate and clarify to propose approaches that can be used on a large scale.
In addition, considering the therapeutic effect, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cell factor release syndrome, a toxic reaction that can be life-threatening.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma demand for treating critical patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, more critical and practical approaches are to separate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that encodes effective antibodies, or to screen effective antibodies for the proteins that are essential to the virus.
In this way, we can easily expand the scale of antibody production.
In China, TCM has been used to treat many diseases for thousands of years.
However, its therapeutic effect depends largely on the combination of multiple ingredients in the prescription, and prescriptions vary according to the disease diagnosis of the TCM theory.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear as it is difficult to extract and validate such ingredients or their best combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, detoxifying capsules and pineapple capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In several provinces of China, 87% of patients were treated with TCM, with the highest healing rates observed for COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7%) and Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei only used TCM in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, with the lowest healing rates (13%).
However, this is only a rough comparison, as many other factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should also be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) therapy alone with combined therapies for WM and TCM.
They found that the WM+TCM group recovered from body temperature, symptoms disappeared, and hospitalization took significantly less time than the simple WM group.
Most impressively, the WM+TCM group had a significantly lower rate of symptom exacerbation (from mild to severe) than the simple WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the WM+TCM group had a similarly lower rate of mortality than the simple WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still requires higher quality controlled trials, a larger scope and more centers to confirm.
Mechanisms that characterize TCM therapy or its combination and, where possible, clarify its effective components will also be of interest.
Most patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 have great fear of this highly contagious and even fatal disease, and isolated people also feel bored, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, oxygen deficiency and cough, and adverse treatment reactions, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
A range of psychological reactions have been in the early stages of the outbreak of SARS, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychopathic symptoms, paranoia and even suicide.
As part of public health response to COVID-19 outbreaks, compulsory close-contact tracking and isolation can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of infection, isolation and pollution on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts and the public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams to communicate clearly by regularly and accurately updating SARS-CoV-2 outbreak information and treatment plans, avoiding close contact with the use of professional electronic devices and applications.
Effective vaccines are critical to breaking the chain of transmission from animal hosts and infected patients to vulnerable hosts, and are often used as a complement to antiviral therapy in controlling outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
The industry has worked hard to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Living vaccines have been evaluated in SARS animal models.
However, before clinical trials were launched, the intramuscular efficacy of these candidate vaccines in elderly and fatal attack models, as well as their protective role in human-animal co-infection, had not been established.
This is probably because SARS has disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been since.
By contrast, due to the continued presence of animal co-infestation sources in the epidemic areas, MERS cases and aggregate outbreaks continue in the Middle East and spread to other regions.
By using antivirus, DNA plasma, virus carriers, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and reorganized protein bases, vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing safe and effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the current outbreak.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time it takes to develop vaccines (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in CoV.
As a new type of disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its complete clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can gradually recover without any consequences.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, patients with severe COVID-19 disease have a high incidence and mortality rate.
Therefore, establishing a predictive model for this disease is crucial for healthcare institutions to prioritize services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on previously clinical studies, the following factors may affect prognosis or be related to prognosis in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor affecting the prognosis of SARS, as is the case with COVID-19.
As mentioned earlier, in a study involving 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurred between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50.
Patients who require severe care are more likely to have underlying complications and complications, and are significantly older than those who do not need severe care (average age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for the end of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned earlier, more men than women were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0,31/10 million versus 0,27/10 million).
Complications and complications: COVID-19 patients who require severe care are more likely to develop acute heart damage and heart rhythm disorders.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also to bind to ACE2-positive gallbladder cells, which may lead to abnormal liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age is closely linked to the underlying disease and may interfere.
Laboratory results are abnormal: levels of C-react protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been considered as potential predictive factors for disease, therapeutic response and eventual recovery.
CRP levels have been suggested to be correlated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
In addition, elevated levels of lactic acid dehydrase (LDH), thyroid amino transferase (AST), pro-amino transferase (ALT) and creatine hydration (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Breast imaging examination and timing of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as an auxiliary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffer from anaphylactic bone loss, resulting in lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used in small doses and for short periods of time in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As mentioned earlier, many patients are under tremendous stress during the outbreak of COVID-19 because they often suffer from prolonged isolation and extreme uncertainty, and witness the death of relatives and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support must be provided to help these patients get rid of stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 seem to be different from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also replicate effectively in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common cold.
As a result, the infected person produces a large amount of virus during daily activities in the early or incubative period of the disease, which makes it very difficult to control the outbreak.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is thought to occur when the patient’s condition is severe, and most transmission does not occur at an early stage.
As a result, current outbreaks of COVID-19 are more severe and difficult to control compared to SARS.
China is currently making enormous efforts, including blocking Wuhan and surrounding cities, and continuing isolation of all populations to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have already caused severe damage to China’s economy and elsewhere, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the pace of the outbreak is slowing.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March, with a downward phase lasting for 3-4 months.
Other experts, however, are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimate that COVID-19 is significantly more contagious than SARS and will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have built a model to predict the consequences of the outbreak, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian team that patients who were recovered and discharged two weeks ago had SARS-CoV-2 detected in both the midnosis and the gout, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a flu-like cyclic epidemic.
However, as the number of new cases decreases, China has shown encouraging signs that the current strategy may have worked.
The Ebola virus was predicted to cause one million cases and cause half a million deaths.
However, through strict isolation, the disease is eventually controlled.
Similar to SARS-CoV, the infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 may be weakened, eventually disappearing or becoming a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with the human body.
The following is a comparison of COVID-19 outbreaks with SARS and MERS (Fig. 55):
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can be transmitted through coughing or spraying, and possibly even through direct contact with an object contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in the stool, which increases the likelihood of spreading the stool.
A recent study involving 138 cases that 41 percent of cases may have been caused by inpatient infections, including 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 healthcare professionals.
Therefore, stricter precautions should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even those who have been in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear masks; the use of surgical masks and dustproof N95 masks (1860s series) can help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent droplets from a potential infected person from spreading through the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects that may be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (Series 1860s) masks prevent the inhalation of viruses small to 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, all about 85 nm.
Since the virus particles can even penetrate five folded surgical masks, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (Series 1860s) masks instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should also wear insulating clothing to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be infected through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through an inflamed eye.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent masks or eyeglasses when facing patients.
For the public in areas affected by the outbreak or potentially affected by the outbreak, it is strongly recommended that everyone use disinfecting soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors in self-isolation and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
Three feet is considered to be the appropriate distance for people to stay away from patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has penetrated into the human world as a new type of virus, based on the deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak, its high level of synchronicity with SARS-CoV on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert in China.
But until January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still reassured the public that the new virus is not very contagious, that the possibility of human transmission is limited, and that the outbreak can be prevented and controlled.
The news clearly eased public alertness, and as the Spring Festival is approaching, the epidemic has been missed at the key nodes in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may take this painful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when issuing announcements because each word is critical to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and respond faster to abnormal information from hospitals, rather than waiting for a formal report from doctors or officials; (3) stricter control of potential outbreaks early in time, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more frequent and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the epidemic and regularly test and improve social response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it has spread throughout China and 50 other countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 looks like a recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial for controlling the outbreak and treating patients.
Older people are affected by COVID-19 more than young people, men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates of older people are also higher than younger people.
The mortality rate for SARS was higher than for COVID-19 (10.91% to 1.44%).
Even without symptoms, COVID-19 patients still spread the virus, while SARS patients usually spread the virus when the condition is severe, which makes it much more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This section explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, the normal RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
On the other hand, a patient who has been cured may revert.
These findings significantly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Given that research on COVID-19 is so rapid, the following key issues remain to be addressed:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the gene homogenity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bat.
Which animal has spread the virus from the primary host—assuming it’s a butterfly—to the middle host of humans?
Without the answers to questions 1 and 2, we would not be able to effectively cut off the transmission pathway, and the outbreak could reoccur at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus accurately enter the respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also combine with cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic? disappear like SARS? or recur like the flu?
Finding the answers to the above and many other questions is crucial, but it may take a long time.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to stop the outbreak as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
Human coronavirus disease originated in animals.
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptability have been driving the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts (including humans).
Prior to 2003, two types of human coronavirus (HCoV) were known to cause mild illnesses, such as common cold.
The outbursts of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have reversed the situation, revealing the destructive and fatality of HCoV infection.
SARS-CoV-2, which appeared in central China at the end of 2019, once again made CoV the focus of attention, surprisingly, it is more spread but less pathogenic than its sister virus SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a common disease in humans, so understanding the origin of HCoV in humans will be helpful for us.
Most HCoVs originate from butterflies and are not pathogenic.
Some intermediate surviving hosts of HCoV are also known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Studying the interactions of CoV hosts in animals may also allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of occurrence of human CoV.
In this review, we review the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, with an emphasis on their history of discovery, the origins of human and animal co-infections and species-to-species spread.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genomic restructuring.
In this context, we explored the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 2019.
In addition, the paper focuses on the requirements for successful completion of the host conversion and the impact of virus evolution on the severity of the disease.
CoV belongs to the coronavirus group and consists of a group of just single-chain RNA viruses with membranes.
These viruses have the largest genome of RNA viruses, containing 2.6 to 3.2 million bases, and are known as “coronavirus” (CoV) because of their coronary form under electronic microscope.
Structurally speaking, CoVs share a non-sectional genome of similar tissues.
About two-thirds of the genome contained two large overlapping open reading boxes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which were translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicant polyproteins.
These polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, known as nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains the ORFs of structural proteins, including atrials (S), membranes (E), membranes (M) and nuclei (N).
Many gene-specific auxiliary proteins are also encoded by different gene CoVs.
According to differences in the protein sequence, CoV is divided into four families (α-CoV, β-CoV,γ-CoV and δ-CoV), whereas the β-CoV family contains most of the HCoV and is divided into four families (A, B, C and D).
Systemic evolutionary evidence suggests that butterflies and reptiles are the genetic sources of most α-CoV and β-CoV, while birds are the primary hosts of γ-CoV and δ-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continuously crossed species barriers, some of which have become important human pathogens.
So far, seven types of human coronavirus (HCoV) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are α-CoV.
Other five β-CoV types include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, leading to severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively higher number of patients, and are more likely to develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extracellular manifestations.
In the mid-1960s, the first strain of HCoV-229E virus strain B814 was isolated from the nasal secretions of common cold patients.
Since then, humans have acquired more relevant knowledge through extensive studies of both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which can cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the notion that infection with HCoV was usually harmless before the outbreak of SARS has been widely accepted.
The 2003 outbreak of SARS is one of the most devastating events in current history, with more than 8,000 people infected, with a mortality rate of about 10 percent.
A decade later, after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, the outbreak continued to spread across the Arabian Peninsula, and the fragments spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV virus (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2) is a pathogen of the continuously prevalent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that, as of March 3, 2020, has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people.
The warning has been sounded that the world must be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven types of HCoV have a common disease origin from butterflies, mice, or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence suggests that all HCoV evolution originated in bats, and that the virus in the bat was well-adapted, non-causing, but showed great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 outbreak brings huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origins of HCoV’s human co-infection provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers, and limitations of viral species jumping.
In addition, this will guide or drive the search for SARS-CoV-2 hosts, intermediate hosts, and expanded animal hosts, which is important for preventing future outbreaks of the virus.
In this review, we provide an overview of the origins, species-to-species transmission and mechanisms of HCoV in humans and animals.
In particular, we highlighted and explored a common theme that HCoV progeny viruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural storage hosts, but are pathogenic after spreading across species to new hosts.
In addition, we also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV, in which the increase in transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
In this context, we also discussed the outcome of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Animal CoV has been widely known since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretions of common cold patients, doctors had isolated different CoVs in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past few decades, seven types of HCoV have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) provides us with rich information and guidance.
In 1966, the first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with an upper respiratory tract infection and subsequently adapted to growth in the WI-38 lung cell strain.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms such as headache, spraying, discomfort, and throat, and 10 to 20% of patients have fever, cough and other symptoms.
In the second half of 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultivation and subsequent continuous transmission in the brain of mammals.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection and do not differ significantly in symptoms from infections with other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A virus and nasal virus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide, spreading mainly in winter in temperate climates.
Usually, the incubation period of both viruses is less than a week, and then about 2 weeks.
A study of human volunteers showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a handful of patients with low immune function show severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as “non-typical pneumonia”, is the first well-recorded epidemic in human history caused by HCoV, whose pathogen is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 cases and 774 deaths, spreading to many countries and continents.
Except for supertransmitters, it is estimated that each case could result in approximately 2 successive cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with a peak of viral load on the 10th day of onset.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and cold warfare, followed by late symptoms such as breathing difficulties, cough and shortness of breath.
Reduced lymphocytes, abnormal liver function and elevated creatinases are common abnormalities in laboratory testing for SARS.
In addition, transmittal pulmonary lesions, supercutaneous cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages were also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of subsequent patients require severe supervision and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe patients, several organs, including the lower respiratory tract, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys, can also be infected, and often accompanied by cell factor storms, which can be fatal in patients with impaired immune function.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy by a relative of a source patient travelling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, people have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, elderly people and immune-impaired patients with respiratory diseases.
Among the diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 are common rhinitis, conjunctivitis, fever and pneumonia.
Another independent study revealed that the same virus was isolated from a nasal sample of an eight-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was found in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for about 4.7 percent of common respiratory diseases, with peak incidence in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive faryngitis (also known as grumpy faryngitis).
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and pneumonia.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and atherosclerosis, HCoV-HKU1 has been to be associated with acute asthma attacks.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide to cause mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally unlikely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases. But there are also incidents and unknown reasons, such as a more toxic, rare subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Typically, their toxicity or pathogenicity also decreases when these HCoVs gain the ability to spread effectively and continue to survive within the human body.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases come from the Middle East, inputs have been in European countries and Tunisia, with occasional successive transmission to close contacts.
In 2015, successive transmission broke out again in South Korea, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also develop acute renal failure, a feature unique to MERS in HCoV-induced diseases so far.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 lab-confirmed cases were, with death rates of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid-December 2019, concentrative pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and was confirmed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been diagnosed worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is noteworthy that the disease mortality rate in Hubei in China was 4.2 percent, while the disease mortality rate outside Hubei was 1.2 percent.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory infections, manifested by fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
Some patients also experience diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the homogenity of 82% of the high nucleotide sequence, they are clustered into different branches in the systemic development tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but is more contagious.
SARS-CoV-2 infection hasly occurred in non-symptomatic people, which may have accelerated the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs, we found very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
At this point, SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with the overall trend for the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms ranged between SARS-CoV and 4 community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection are more common in community-acquired HCoV infections, including manifestations of non-specific, mild or even asymptomatic characteristics.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe cases of COVID-19 were also seen in cases of SARS-CoV infection, although the percentage was slightly lower.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern features of community-acquired HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the spreadability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoV.
On the other hand, whether SARS-CoV-2’s spreadability, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, will decline after human transmission, remains to be verified.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether, at least in some cases, the fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in SARS-CoV remains to be clarified by future research.
It is also important to observe whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as community-acquired HCoV.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2’s spread, pathogenicity and continued post-human transmission will have a significant impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that caused mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the great popularity of ancient HCoV.
HCoV, which causes serious human diseases, and people with severe HCoV diseases have all died.
To do this, HCoV must be sufficiently replicated in humans to accumulate adaptive mutations, thereby combating host restrictive factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it can adapt well, then its spread among humans will be difficult to stop by isolation or other infection control measures.
Over the years, these four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread across populations, causing people with normal immune function to develop common colds.
These viruses do not need an animal host.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not yet well adapted to humans and cannot continue to spread among humans.
They need to survive and reproduce among humans and animals, and may seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets through one or more intermediate and expanded hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and 4 community-acquired HCoVs.
It is as highly contagious as community-acquired HCoV, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it can fully adapt to humans and circulate within humans without a host or intermediate animal host remains to be observed.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, discussing the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural hosts, storage hosts, intermediate hosts, and expanded hosts has some guidance for us.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor that is highly homogeneous at the nucleotide sequence level, the animal will become the evolutionary host of HCoV.
Ancestral viruses are usually highly adaptive and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, storage hosts also carry HCoV continuously for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCoV has just parasited in the intermediate host shortly after or immediately again in the human body, then it will not adapt well to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a source of human-infected animal co-infection, and play a role in enlarging the host by allowing the virus to briefly replicate and then spread to humans to widen the scale of human infection.
If HCoV cannot maintain its spread within the intermediate host, a terminal infection may occur.
Instead, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even establish long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural storage host.
A review of epidemiological data revealed that the indexed cases of SARS had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent serum-positive surveys showed higher levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) resistant to SARS-CoV in animal dealers compared to the general population.
For the first time on the live animal market, a beetle and a cat were found to carry the SARS-CoV-like virus, almost identical to the SARS-CoV virus.
The fact that there were no further reports of SARS after the removal of all the beetles from the market indirectly supports this view.
However, reports showed that farm beetles in the wild or untouched markets for live animals were largely negative for SARS-CoV detection, suggesting that beetles may be just intermediate enlargement hosts, rather than natural hosts of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that since 80% of different animals on the Guangzhou market have SARS-CoV antibodies, it is not possible to rule out a variety of small mammals that may also serve as a possibility of expanding hosts in the middle of SARS-CoV.
All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent studies of SARS-CoV natural animal hosts found a closely related bat coronavirus, known as SARS-related chickpeas coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), to survive in chickpeas.
These butterflies were positive for the genome sequence of SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat coronavirus are homogeneous with SARS-CoV in 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence.
These studies lay the foundation for the new concept that butterflies are hosts of newly emerging human pathogens.
In addition, the researchers identified several types of SARS coronavirus (SL-CoV) from butterflies, but no virus could be isolated as a living virus except for one specified WIV1.
Human vascular stressor conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a known receptor for SARS-CoV.
Experiments have shown that WIV1 extracted from bat fecal samples uses bat, beetle and human ACE2 as a receptor for its entrance into cells.
Interestingly, serums of patients with SARS recovery period were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the closest ancestor to bat SARS-CoV, with 95% of the nucleotide sequence homogenity.
Although the two viruses are highly homogeneous, it is generally assumed that WIV1 is not a direct parent of SARS-CoV, nor is the butterfly a direct host of SARS-CoV.
System development analysis classified MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Butterflies CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV invaded the virus using the same host receptor dihydrogenase4 (DPP4).
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is closer in systemic development to the corresponding RNA in bats β-CoV from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild butterflies.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, CoV-HKU25, have only 87% sequence homogenity of nucleotide.
Therefore, the butterfly may not be the direct host of MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have shown that unicorns are positive for the serum of MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, just as many camels in many African countries originate in the Middle East.
The living MERS-CoV that is separated from the nasal wipes of a monophilus is the same as the virus found in the human body, further suggesting that the camels are the true hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that in camels with experimental infection with MERS-CoV, the general symptoms were mild, but a large number of virus drops were observed.
It is worth noting that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal pathway, and the fecal pathway is also the main pathway for bat to spread the virus.
However, the problem remains, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms appear, which may be attributed to human transmission or unknown pathways, including unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% homogeneity of nucleic acid with the CoV RaTG13 that is separated from the central chickpeas.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to determine genealogy.
In other words, unless almost the same bat coronavirus is discovered in the future, bats may not be the direct host of SARS-CoV-2.
It is speculated that the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with many initial cases of COVID-19 among wildlife species sold and killed in the South China Sea wholesale market, suggesting that there may be an event of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on macro-genome sequencing have suggested that a small, endangered mammal known as a goat may also carry an ancestor β-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new transgenic coronavirus genomes were homogeneous with SARS-CoV-2 with 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence.
But they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with approximately 90% homogenity at the nucleotide sequence level.
In the systemic development trees, they were classified as two subfamilies of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses, one of which had a more similar receptor-binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and had 97.4% amino acid sequence homogeneity.
By contrast, the RBD differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are greater, although the sequence homogenity of the entire genome of the two is higher.
A previous study on the disease of the shark also detection of virus overlapping from lung samples, with results that have a similar relationship with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different assembly methods and artificial processing to obtain partial genome sequences that accounted for approximately 86.3% of the total genome of the virus.
We can’t rule out the possibility that the shark is one of the intermediate animals hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, because SARS-CoV-2 differs from the β-CoV sequence associated with SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is directly derived from SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in butterflies, caterpillars and other mammals remains to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homogenity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and carpenter, SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest total genome sequence homogenity.
It is highly speculative that the high similarity between SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-related RBD is caused by the convergence evolution of selective mediation.
Another opposite view is that beetle SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV and RaTG13 are restructured in the third species of wildlife.
As a driver of evolution, restructuring is widely present in β-CoV.
The direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 in humans and animals is unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the researchers also studied the genetic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 in humans.
Systemic evolutionary evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronavirus, while the ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus, known as ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), found in North American tricolor butterflies, has been shown to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, has a genetic link to another bat coronavirus (called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008) found in Ghana, where camel species are also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
For clarity, Figure 1 and Figure 2 summarize existing knowledge about known animal origins of HCoV.
Systemic developmental analysis provides evidence for intersecting events of HCoV in history.
After 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infectious diseases occurred when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from livestock to species.
The history of interspecular transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
A bitch-α-CoV closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Between the two appeared an α-CoV lamb.
There is a number of evidence that supports the virus spreading directly from butterflies to humans.
First, humans, rather than camels, may be in contact with butterflies in a common ecosystem.
On the contrary, humans have close contact with the calves.
Second, the butterfly α-CoV associated with HCoV-229E was diversified and non-pathogenic in butterflies, while the lamb α-CoV caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, α-CoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of obtaining HCoV-229E-related α-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, butterflies are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies, Ebola, Nepa and Hendra.
Therefore, it is not surprising that butterflies spread HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Or, although bat-a-CoV acts as a genetic repository for HCoV-229E, the calf and the unicorn may be the intermediate hosts of the virus to humans, which is exactly the same as MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good illustration of species-to-species transmission from butterflies to unicorns and from unicorns to humans.
The evolutionary origins of the MERS-CoV of the butterfly have been known in its initial identification, and subsequent discoveries have reinforced this argument.
Apparently, butterflies provide a rich library of viruses for species-to-species exchange and spread of genetic fragments.
Long-lived and intensive groups, close social interactions and strong flight abilities are all favorable conditions for the butterfly to become an ideal “virus transmitter.”
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been in the body of the monophilus for decades.
It adapts well to these camels, and the camels have also turned from intermediate hosts to stable natural storage hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease in these animals andins a relatively low rate of mutation.
Its spread to humans is an accident, and due to its inability to continue its spread, humans remain the terminal host of MERS-CoV.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of clover in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different (if any).
In particular, the β-CoV is highly pathogenic in the wearer.
They may be the terminal hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related β-CoV, similar to fruit beetles in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be identified or ruled out.
First, the butterflies may be hosts of the SARS-CoV-2-related virus, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share their ecosystems with butterflies through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, the shark may be one of the mid-expanding hosts of the new SARS-CoV-2-related virus invasion.
Humans infect the virus by killing and eating wild smells.
Many mammals, including livestock, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody testing is necessary for livestock and wildlife.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may be restructured and adapted in third species that have been in contact with both butterflies and caterpillars.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors on the virus side also play an important role in promoting coronavirus crossing the interspecies barrier.
First, they have a higher rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, coronavirus mutation rates are estimated to be "medium" to "high", with an average annual substitution rate of approximately 10-4 times per spot, depending on the coronavirus' adaptation phase to the new host.
Coronavirus has a calibration of the activity of nucleic acid extraheatase, which can result in very high variability and decay, and even inability to survive.
Interestingly, Remdesivir, a known nucleotide-like, can inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting this nucleotide-exothetase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Reduse is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the coronavirus is about one million times more mutant than its host.
In addition, if the coronavirus does not adapt well to the host, its mutation rate is usually high.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high rates of mutation, SARS-CoV-2 has significantly lower rates of mutation, indicating that it is more adaptable to humans.
It can be speculated that it has adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has adapted well to single-top mice.
In theory, gene fluttering is unlikely to make vaccines and antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 quickly invalid.
Second, the larger RNA genome in the coronavirus has additional plasticity in the modification of genetic mutations and restructuring, thereby increasing the possibility of species-to-species synergies, which favor the emergence of new coronavirus in suitable conditions.
A large number of unique open reading boxes and protein functions toward 3' end coding of the genome provide evidence for this.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch templates through a unique “replication selection” mechanism during the RNA replication process.
In the host as a hybrid container, chain exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homogeneous full-length and achinomic RNAs can restructure to produce new coronaviruses.
Evidence of natural systemic reorganization has been found in animal coronavirus such as HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interactions associated with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction between the virus and the host receptor is another key factor affecting species-to-species transmission.
This article is a typical example of SARS-CoV restructuring, showing evidence of positive selection in interspecular transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the strains separating SARS-CoV from humans and frogs, the researchers believe that SARS-CoV can quickly adapt to different hosts, through mutations in the S-protein RBD.
Typically, RBDs in coronavirus S proteins interact with cell receptors and are rigorously screened for host antibody responses.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318 to 510 amino acids in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors to allow the virus to enter.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including butterflies, beetles, mice, and cats, thus causing the virus to spread across species.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were observed in the RBD, which differed from the separation strains of humans and beetles, and four of these residues were located in the receptor binding sequence that interacts with the ACE2 receptor.
The presence of K479N and S487T mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV in Fruitbeas may increase the affinity of fibroproteins to human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the substitution of these two amino acids may be crucial for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV differences in S-protein S1 units were 30%, meaning that the binding affinity of their S-protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
Indeed, a frozen spectroscope study showed that this bond was 10 to 20 times stronger than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also make sense to determine whether any other co-receptors are needed in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
In addition, there are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E's amino fenase N and HCoV-OC43's 9-O-acetylated salivary acid.
They may also explain why the above coronavirus has successfully adapted to humans after spreading across species from animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of inter-species transmission of HCoV is also influenced by other host dependence and restrictive factors.
The differences between these host proteins in humans and the natural hosts of HCoV such as butterflies, unicorns, and rabbits may constitute a barrier to species-to-species transmission.
HCoV must deprive the host of the dependence factor and break the host restriction factor in order to successfully spread between species.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important field of virus-host interaction remain to be determined and characterized.
Impartial full-genome screening of SARS-CoV-2’s host dependence and restrictive factors using the latest CRISPR technology could be successful.
The emergence of a new type of HCoV: back to the original
The diversity of the bat coronavirus provides sufficient opportunities for the emergence of new types of HCoV.
In this sense, the bat coronavirus serves as the genetic repository for HCoV.
Furthermore, rapid mutations and genetic restructuring are also driving the evolution of HCoV and two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes can radically change the epitome of the virus.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, because the SARS-CoV-related bat virus is isolated, but found to be able to encode different ORF8 proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important for human adaptation.
At the onset of the human epidemic, 29 characteristics of SARS-CoV nucleotide deficiency were found in isolated strains of the virus.
This deficiency divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host conversion.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV may have been rearranged with the α- and γ-CoV genealogy, where a large number of smaller rearranged areas have been found in RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Restructuring points were also found in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, studies have shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has undergone interstitial restructuring events, which occurred in Saudi Arabia’s unicorns.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, restructuring events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoV and other animal coronavirus were restructured in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can lead to unexpected changes in the viral genome, most likely due to selective pressures such as the host immune system facing the virus.
An example of these effects is in the prototype virus strain of HCoV-229E, where a lack of bionucleic acid leads to a lack of full-length ORF4.
Although complete ORF4 can be observed in the bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the camel α-CoV shows a single nucleic acid insert, causing transcoding mutations.
Last but equally important, the evolution of the new type of HCoV is also driven by the pressure to choose storage hosts.
After the coronavirus infection was detected, there were no symptoms or only mild symptoms, indicating an adaptation between the coronavirus and the bat.
From an anatomical and physiological point of view, bats seem to have adapted well to the coronavirus.
For example, a defect in the activation of the butterfly inflammatory response effectively reduces pathological changes induced by the coronavirus.
In addition, because of the positive regulation of the suppressive natural-destruction cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of molecular expression of the primary tissue-compatibility complex, class I, the natural-destruction cell activity in bates was suppressed.
Furthermore, the high level of active oxygen (ROS) produced by the high metabolic activity of the butterfly can both inhibit coronavirus replication and can be calibrated by nucleic acid exocetase influence, thereby providing selective pressure for the virus strain to enter the new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains may also evolve through restructuring, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to accommodate hosts.
Therefore, the appearance of three new types of HCoV over the past two decades is not a coincidence.
The coronavirus does not cause illness or cause minor symptoms in hosts stored in storage, such as butterflies and camels.
They do a large number of replications and do not cause a strong host immune response.
That’s why there are symptomless carriers, as well as cases of severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms occur mainly due to the overactivation of the immune response and the cell factor storm, so the stronger the immune response, the worse the lung damage will be.
In contrast, in non-symptomatic carriers, the immune response has been detached from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of unchecking the immune response may play a positive role in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon reaction in the butterflies is strong.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bates was also deficient.
Based on this reasoning, the use of MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 inflammatory organisms may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV generate rely.
Although bat β-CoV has been found to be 95% homogeneous to SARS-CoV, there is a bat coronavirus that is up to 96% homogeneous to SARS-CoV-2.
Although the same virus as SARS-CoV has been found in the market, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
An apparent homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2 has been detected, suggesting that it may be one of the intermediate hosts, or that it may have contributed a fragment of the gene to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally artificially produced.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus has again become the focus of attention.
The study of coronavirus in butterflies and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the origin of HCoV in humans and the importance of animal hosts in human transmission.
There is abundant evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and spread to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infections originate from contact between humans and beetles on the market, closing the wet-food market and killing beetles could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Similarly, given the discovery of multiple genealogy associated with SARS-CoV-2, which are closely associated with SARS-CoV-2, the genealogy should be removed from the wet goods market to prevent the spread of the disease.
But whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through carnivores and other mammals remains to be further investigated.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in single-top mice for a long time.
These camels are important means of transportation and the main source of local meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to imitate the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
In order to prevent a recurrence of MERS outbreaks, combined with other infection control measures, comprehensive initiatives should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels.
Because we can’t eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge, causing outbreaks.
Various human-species coronaviruses circulate in the wild.
In particular, there is a high diversity of bat coronavirus with a common disease potential for animals.
These co-infected coronaviruses have many opportunities for evolution and restructuring, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or deadly in humans in the future.
In some parts of China, a culture that eats wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
After the severe test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, we should develop better prevention and response plans.
In fact, many viruses have existed on Earth for a long time.
They remain in their natural hosts until the opportunity flows.
Although the butterflies have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, if people are educated to stay away from the butterflies and other wildlife species, the chances of human exposure to the butterflies and other wildlife species are greatly reduced.
In order to better understand the ecological status of the coronavirus and its natural hosts, continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary, a fact that will prove to be very useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future outbreaks.
In short, the most effective way to prevent viral human co-infection is to keep humans away from the natural hosts of the human co-infection virus.
There are still some shortcomings in the mystery of the origin of human co-patogenic disease SARS-CoV-2.
First, if a butterfly spreads an ancient SARS-CoV-2 virus to a donkey, it makes sense to explore where both a donkey and a donkey can share the same ecosystem.
Second, if the butterflies play a more direct role in human transmission, then how humans come into contact with the butterflies remains to be determined.
Third, if the third type of mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clear how it interacts with different species including humans, butterflies, and carpenters.
Finally, since many mammals, including livestock, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infectious studies should be carried out.
If it’s butterflies, caterpillars, or other mammals, it’s expected that SARS-CoV-2 or almost the same parent virus will be found in natural hosts in the future.
Further research in this field will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which is important for the prevention and control of human COVID-19.
Updated diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 “Suspected Cases” and “Confirmed Cases”
On February 6, 2020, our team released the 2019 Rapid Recommendations Guide for Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, which provides experience and insights for global response to outbreaks.
However, 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new type of disease that is gradually improving our awareness of the disease based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we respond to one of the comments on the above guidelines and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the latest “COVID-19 Clinical Treatment Plan” issued by the National Health and Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (Seventh Edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which has now been officially named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation guide and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
Since its publication, it has attracted widespread attention.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new type of disease and our awareness of the disease is gradually improving based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; as a result, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health and Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) released a total of 7 editions of the COVID-19 Treatment Scheme between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which have undergone substantial changes.
Now, our guide has received feedback from Zhou and others who have proposed a simple rating scheme based on their clinical experience.
Their work provides new evidence for our guidelines and also provides valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We recognize this important work they have done and express our gratitude.
However, their proposals also need to be updated based on the latest COVID-19 treatment plan (Pilot 7), as well as recent research.
According to the 7th edition (March 3, 2020), confirmed cases require a combination of an epidemiological history feature with two clinical manifestations for comprehensive analysis, and three clinical manifestations are required if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) had a history of traveling or residing in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were within 14 days before symptoms appeared; (2) had a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infections (nuclear acid test positive); (3) had a history of contact with people with fever or respiratory symptoms in communities with COVID-19 from Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other reports within 14 days before symptoms appeared; (4) had a history of contact with aggregate confirmed cases (with less than 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a small range within 2 weeks before symptoms appeared, such as at home, office, school and classrooms).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or decreased total white cells in early onset and decreased lymphatic count.
Confirmed cases should be diagnosed on the basis of suspicious cases and any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive; (2) viral genome sequencing showed a high degree of homogeneity with known new coronavirus; (3) serum testing showed positive IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2; or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies turned from negative to positive, or droplings increased ≥4 times during the recovery period, higher than in the acute period.
We can see that the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020) add real-time PCR nucleic acid testing in respiratory tract or blood samples.
The fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth edition (February 8, 2020) added pathogenetic testing for blood samples; subsequently, the seventh edition added serological evidence.
These modifications are based on the continued work of the researchers of the best nucleic acid test test test box for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory samples including bleeding, which increases the availability of different samples and provides evidence for incorporating positive results for specific antibodies into the confirmation criteria.
Moreover, more and more evidence reminds us to pay attention to non-typical symptoms and non-symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the chart should be updated for people like Zhou, as they would classify people with no clinical symptoms as “low risk.”
In addition, the rating system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and research.
Finally, we hope for more direct evidence and invite readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of “suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases”, we recommend referring to and following the latest guidelines for the country where the cases occur.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19
Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on the same day.

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended the residence permit until May 1.
Australian stores lower the ceiling on the number of toilet papers for each transaction
On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles across the country lowered the ceiling to two packs and one packet for each transaction of toilet paper purchases in all their stores, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a restriction on the purchase of a package on Monday.
These restrictions are posted in the form of messages on the treasury or on the Facebook page of the chain store.
Buyers stocked goods for fear of COVID-19 in order to prevent them from having to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the number of toilet paper purchases delivered to a single package.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles introduced a limit of 4 packs per transaction on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles in its March 8 press release that after imposing a restriction on the purchase of four packages, “many stores still sell out within an hour of arrival” and said demand was “unprecedented,” while ALDI called its start “unforeseen” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesman, sales last week increased “dramatically.”
Last week, the Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packages.
To further mitigate the shortage, Cole ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequencies, Woolworths ordered additional inventories, and ALDI prepared inventories in advance for the planned Wednesday offer.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventories, but local parliamentary restrictions on truck delivery times made it difficult.
He predicts that production costs will rise as suppliers try to meet demand, while preferential activities will decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores will not be able to hold special events on Wednesday after the early release of inventory.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores are replenishing inventories every night.
He said that toilet paper is a large item, so there is a smaller amount of inventory, and, once sold, will leave a huge shelf space, exacerbating the feeling of material shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths’ point of view is that if there are a lot of things on the shelves, such as rolling paper and handwashing products that can be [bought] and in sufficient quantities, you may not be so panicked,” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they had no stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which makes clean toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent toilet paper, both emphasize that they are working all day and weekends to ensure supply.
Real estate website Domain.com that due to the smaller number of auctions carried out by buyers during the Labour Day weekend break, some real estate dealers would offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne.
NT News is a printed daily newspaper in Darwin, which contains eight-page plugins in its Thursday edition designed to be used as toilet paper after cutting.
According to ABC Australia’s March 3 report, the stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on purchases, saying they did not plan to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that the demand for other commodities is also high, including masks, handwashes, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, the UK online supermarket Ocado restricted the number of Andres toilet paper purchases on Sunday night to 2 packs, 12 volumes per packet.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 (a disease triggered by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.
Although the term “pandemic” refers only to the extent to which the disease is spread, and not to the degree of danger of specific cases, the WHO noted the need to urge governments to take action:
“All countries/regions can still change the course of this big popularity.
If countries/regions conduct detection, testing, treatment, isolation, tracking and mobilization of their people as a response,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned about the astonishing extent of spread and severity and the astonishing degree of non-action.”
Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the outbreak was “unprecedented.”
He commented on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus has been discovered, except for the flu, that has continued to spread around the world since its appearance.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view and said “we’ve never seen a coronavirus-induced pandemic before.”
He continued, “Likewise, we’ve never seen a virus pandemic that can be controlled before.”
Prior to the new pandemic, the WHO identified the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the outbreak, “most importantly, it’s still getting worse.”
As of Thursday, Associated Press at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak is a continuous spread of the 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019 confirmed that January 30, 2020 was classified as a public health emergency of international concern, and March 11, 2020 was identified as an epidemic.
As of April 10, 2020, 210 countries and regions worldwide have approximately 161 million cases of COVID-19 and about 9,7 million deaths.
Healed about 36,4 million people.
The disease mortality rate in China is about 4 percent, while the global disease mortality rate ranges from 0.08 percent (New Zealand) to 13.04 percent (Algeria).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
And may be accompanied by complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The incubation period from contact with the patient to the onset of the disease varies from 2 to 14 days, usually about 5 days.
There are currently no vaccines or special anti-viral treatments.
Clinical treatment is primarily based on symptom-supporting treatment. Recommended preventive measures include careful hand washing, cutting off the mouth when coughing, keeping a safe distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation of suspects of infection.
Official agencies have taken response measures such as travel restrictions, isolation, night bars, hazard prevention and control in workplaces and closure of facilities.
The outbreak has caused a severe shock to the global social economy, with sports, religious, political and cultural events delayed or cancelled, and panic shopping has exacerbated a widespread supply shortage.
193 countries and regions across the globe have implemented national or local shutdown measures, affecting approximately 99.4% of primary and secondary school and college students.
As false virus information spread over the Internet, there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East Asian and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance groups, as well as groups in severe areas affected by the epidemic.
However, reduced traffic and heavy industry shutdowns have led to lower air pollution indices and reduced carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, the health department of Wuhan, China, an unknown number of cases of pneumonia and launched an investigation in early January 2020.
The majority of these cases are related to the wholesale market in the South China Sea, so the new coronavirus is considered to be a disease common to animals.
The virus that triggered the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to bat coronavirus, coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first patients identified were confirmed on December 1, 2019, and there was no apparent link with the subsequent cases of the South China seafood market.
Of the early cases in December 2019, two-thirds were confirmed to be related to the South China Seafood market.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post published an unconfirmed report that the first case may date back to November 17, 2019, with a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province.On February 26, 2020, according to the World Health Organization, the number of new cases in China decreased, but the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea increased sharply and the number of new cases outside of China surpassed the domestic number for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially mild cases.
As of February 26, the number of adolescent cases was relatively low, with adolescents aged 19 and under accounting for only 2.4% worldwide. Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Wallace estimated that approximately 60% of the UK population infected with the new coronavirus would need effective group immunity.
The number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be positive according to the official program.
As of March 23, none of the countries in the world had tested less than 3% of the total population, and many countries have issued official policies not to test for mild people, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that as of January 23, China estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, while these unrecorded infections were the source of 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the actual number of infections in Italy far exceeds the number of cases.
Basic infection numbers (R0) for COVID-19 were initially estimated to range from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control suggests that R0 may be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 can recover.
Patients who are unable to recover from the onset of illness to death are 6-41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 9,7 million people died from COVID-19.
As of February 5, about 80 percent of deaths in China were in people over 60 years of age, and 75 percent of deaths were accompanied by underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official statistics for COVID-19 deaths generally refer to patients with positive coronavirus deaths according to the official scheme.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may well exceed statistics, as the data may not include untested patients, such as those who died at home, in a spa, etc.
Some data from Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the outbreak was four to five times the number of deaths from neo-coronavirus pneumonia in official statistics.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said: “We know [the number of deaths] is lower than the actual number,” and rumors about underestimated U.S. data confirm this statement. Underestimating is common in epidemic areas, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. On January 9, 2020, the first confirmed deaths occurred in Wuhan, China.
The first out-of-China deaths occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first out-of-Asia deaths occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were outside of China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica deaths.
These numbers vary from region to region and change over time and are influenced by population characteristics such as detection, health system quality, treatment scheme, time of first outbreak and age, gender and overall health status.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, by April 10, 2020, the global disease mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
Disease mortality rates vary in different regions.
In China, the estimated disease mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (patients who develop from 1 January to 10 2020) to 0.7% (patients who develop after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), the former reflecting the percentage of disease deaths from the confirmed population and the latter reflecting the percentage of disease deaths from the infected population (including confirmed and undiagnosed numbers).
These statistics have no time limits and track the entire process of resolving a particular population from infection to case to case.
Many scholars try to calculate the above data for a particular population.
According to the Oxford Medical Center, the overall infection mortality rate ranged from 0.1% to 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of the range is consistent with the first randomized testing in Germany for COVID-19 and a statistical analysis study on the impact of the detection on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization says the outbreak is controllable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and vary by region.
Maciej Boni, from Penn State University, noted: “If not controlled, outbreaks of infectious diseases typically go into stagnation after existing hosts are exhausted and then begin to tend to relieve.
But at the moment, it’s almost impossible to reasonably predict when the turning point will occur.”
China’s senior medical adviser, Zhang Nanshan, said that if all countries mobilized to adopt the World Health Organization’s recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus, “the end of the outbreak in June could be expected.”
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said SARS-CoV-2 “could be a repeated outbreak, lasting for one to two years.”
Research led by Neil Ferguson at the Imperial Institute of Technology suggests the need to maintain physical distance and other measures “before the vaccine is put into use (may take 18 months or longer).”
William Schaffner, from Vanderburg University, said: “This coronavirus is very spread, and I think it’s unlikely to disappear completely,” and “may evolve into a seasonal disease that breaks out once a year.”
The pathogenic force of the re-emerging depends on the group’s immunity and mutation level.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively non-specific, and some infected people may have no symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (sputum), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or vomiting. According to the World Health Organization, about one-sixth of patients turn into severe illness and experience breathing difficulties.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) lists breathing difficulties, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden uncertainty, difficulty waking up and youthfulness of the face or lips as emergency symptoms; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hemorrhage, infectious shock and death.
Some infected people may have no symptoms and no clinical manifestations, but the test results are positive, so researchers recommend closely monitoring and examining close contacts with confirmed patients to rule out the possibility of infection.
China estimates that the proportion of non-symptomatic infected varies from extremely low to 44%.
The incubation period (from infection to the onset of the disease) is generally 1-14 days; 5 days are the most common. As to uncertainty, one example can be illustrated: The percentage of patients with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially estimated at 30%, then dropped to 15%.
Some details about the pathway of transmission of the disease have not yet been determined.
Currently, it is believed that the disease is spread mainly through close contact and through coughing, spraying or speaking; close contact refers to an interval of 1-2 meters (3-6 feet).
Studies have found that unobstructed cough can cause the splash to spread to the distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (15-27 feet).
It has also been suggested that the fox that people produce while talking can also lead to the spread of the virus while staying in the air for a longer period of time. Although the virus can not usually spread through the air, people can also produce fox when breathing or speaking.
This sputum can fall into the mouth of the surrounding person and even be inhaled into the lungs.
Medical procedures such as interstitial and cardiopulmonary recovery (CPR) may cause the respiratory secretions to dim, thereby causing air to spread.
In addition, if a person touches a virus-infected surface (including the skin) and then touches the mouth of his or her own nose, it can also cause the virus to spread.
There are fears that the virus may spread through the stool, but this risk is considered to be lower.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through feces. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset, but it is also contagious before and after the onset.
Positive results can be detected at the earliest three days before the onset, indicating that the new coronavirus is already contagious before obvious symptoms appear.
Although few cases of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic infections have been, some countries have found asymptomatic infections in the course of contact tracking surveys.
The European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) said that while the spread of the new coronavirus is not fully clear, one person can infect 2-3 people. The virus survives on the surface of objects from hours to days.
Specifically, the known new coronavirus can survive up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, its survival time is also influenced by humidity and temperature. There have been cases of positive COVID-19 testing in pets and other animals.
There is currently no evidence that animals can transmit the virus again to humans, but UK officials still recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, as they do with other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
Serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of virus that was first isolated in three patients with pneumonia in a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus associated in nature. The virus can be killed with home soap before it enters the human body, as soap can dissolve the protective membrane of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Currently, it is considered an animal disease.
Genetic analysis has shown that this coronavirus is genetically associated with the beta coronavirus Sarbecovirus subtype (B-type) and two clusters of bat source virus strains.
The coronavirus was consistent with other patch coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the overall genome level at 96%.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that some parts of the genome had only one amino acid less than some of the viruses in the human body.
To date, the overall genomic comparison found that up to 92% of the genetic material between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is identical, not enough to prove that the coronavirus is the intermediate host.
Whether the virus is infected can be initially diagnosed by symptoms, but ultimately confirmed by the reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected secretions.
A PCR and CT comparison study conducted in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, and many imaging characteristics overlap with other processes of pneumonia and disease development.
By March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommended that “CT should not be used for screening for COVID-19 or as the first test to diagnose the disease.”
The World Health Organization has announced several screening schemes for SARS-CoV-2, with the first one released on January 17.
Nucleic acid detection is performed using real-time reverse polymer chain reactions (rRT-PCR).
Respiratory samples or blood samples can be used for testing.
Results can usually be obtained within hours to days.
In general, this test is done through a nasopharyngeal wiper and can also be done through a nasopharyngeal wiper. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests for detecting antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these testing methods were proven accurate enough and could not be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for use only in emergencies by certified laboratories.
Typical imaging characteristics of X-rays and computer rupture scans (CT) in patients with the disease include external mowing glass shade asymmetry and no chest cavity accumulation.
The Italian Society of Radiation is compiling an international online database of imaging performance for confirmed cases.
Because it overlaps with other viral infections, such as adenovirus, images not confirmed by PCR have limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large Chinese study comparing chest CT results with PCR results found that although images are less specific to identifying infections, detection is faster and more sensitive, so it could be considered as a screening method for the affected areas.
A volume neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed that can be combined using X-rays and CT to detect the image characteristics of viruses.
Measures to prevent the spread of diseases include good personal hygiene habits, careful hand washing, avoiding unwashed hands directly touching the mouth of the eye, coughing or spraying with a towel covering the mouth, and used towels directly thrown into the trash.
Suspects of infection should wear medical surgical masks when entering public places.
It is also recommended to maintain physical distance to prevent the spread of the virus. Many governments have restricted or recommended avoiding unnecessary travel back to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has now reached the community spread stage in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community and some community residents are unaware of where or how they are infected. Healthcare professionals who are exposed to suspicious infection should take standard precautions, exposure prevention and eye protection. Tracking contact is an important means for health regulators to identify the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The government’s use of mobile phone location data for tracking purposes has raised concerns about privacy, and more than 100 organizations, including Amnesty International, have issued statements calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
A variety of mobile apps are already in use or proposed for volunteer use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on solutions with privacy protection features, such as using Bluetooth to track the distance between users and other phones.
Once users have been in close contact with patients with positive COVID-19 test results, they receive information alerts. Misstatements about preventing infection continue to spread; such as rinse the nose and rinse the mouth with water are ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, but many organizations are actively developing it.
It is recommended to prevent the spread of disease by washing hands carefully.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially when there are obvious impurities after the toilet or on the hand, before meals, and after coughing, coughing or spraying.
This is because the virus can destroy its protective membranes before entering the human body, using only home soap, thus playing the role of killing the virus.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends that if there is no soap and sewage around you, use alcohol-containing handwashes with at least 60% alcohol content.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands.
A variety of solutions can be used to disinfect the surface of the object (the disinfectant acts on the surface of stainless steel within a minute), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% ethanol, 0.1% sodium chloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% polyphenol.
Other solutions (such as benzodiazepine and chlorophyllipt glucose) are less effective.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends that if new cases of suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia appear in offices or day care facilities, all areas should be disinfected, including offices, bathrooms, public areas, and shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic money collection machines used by patients.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths with curved elbows or towels when coughing or spraying, and remove all contaminated towels immediately.
It is recommended that suspects of infection wear medical surgical masks, as wearing masks can reduce the amount of sputum exhaled when speaking, spraying and coughing and shorten the spread distance.
The World Health Organization has published instructions on the use of masks and methods.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: “Wearing masks reduces people’s tendency to touch the face, and touching the face is also a major source of infection when hand hygiene is not appropriate.”
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks only in high-risk areas, such as those responsible for caring for COVID-19 patients, but the organization also recognizes that wearing masks helps to avoid touching the face.
Some countries and regions have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends wearing non-medical masks made from fabrics, while China explicitly recommends that healthy citizens wear one-time medical masks, especially when in close contact with others (within 1 meter (3 feet).
Hong Kong recommends wearing masks when using public transport or entering crowded places.
Thai health officials advise people to make homemade masks and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia it is strictly forbidden not to wear masks or cover your mouth in public places.
On March 16, Vietnam demanded that all people wear masks before entering public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government regulates that everyone entering the grocery store must wear a mask.
Israel requires all residents to wear masks in public.
China's Taiwan has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, and on April 1, it began to require the obligation to wear masks on trains and interurban buses.
Panama regulates the obligation of wearing masks and advises residents who cannot buy masks to wear homemade masks.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Infection prevention measures about keeping social distance (also called keeping physical distance) are aimed at minimizing close contact between people, thereby slowing down the spread of disease.
Measures include isolation; travel restrictions; shutdowns, shutdowns and the closure of stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Measures that individuals can take to maintain social distance include staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding access to crowded areas, switching to non-contact greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
Nowadays, many governments have compelled or recommended social distance in areas affected by the outbreak.
Regarding the size of the largest crowd, U.S. government agencies and health organizations initially recommended 250 people (in areas without COVID-19 transmission), then soon reduced to 50 and later decreased to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Elderly people and groups with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and impaired immune system are at higher risk of severe and complicated diseases. The German Centers for Disease Control recommend that people living in epidemic areas avoid going outside as much as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations began to replace the phrase “maintaining physical distance” with “maintaining social distance” to clarify the purpose of reducing physical contact whileining social connections, including virtual and remote connections.
The use of the phrase “Keep Social Distance” contains the meaning of asking people to be completely isolated from society, without encouraging people to adopt other ways to stay connected between people. Some authoritative agencies have also issued guidelines for sexual health that apply during the epidemic.
Recommendations include having sex only with partners who live together and are not infected with the virus or without symptoms.
Self-isolation of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and suspected infected persons at home is recommended.
Health institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation.Many governments have forced or recommended self-isolation for all inhabitants of epidemic areas.
The most stringent self-isolation instructions have also been issued to high-risk populations.
Patients who may have been exposed to COVID-19 or have recently been to a country or region where the virus has spread extensively are advised to isolate themselves within 14 days from the last time they may be exposed to the virus.
Epidemic prevention and control strategies include containment/repression and mitigation.
Controlling is applicable in the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of tracking and isolating infected persons while taking other measures of infection prevention and vaccination to prevent the disease from spreading to other populations.
If it is not possible to curb the spread of diseases, efforts should be made to move to the mitigation phase: measures to slow the spread of diseases and reduce the impact of diseases on health systems and society.
Countering and mitigating measures can be carried out simultaneously.
Suppression requires more extreme precautions to reverse the epidemic by reducing the base recurrence to less than 1. Part of the effort to control the outbreak of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, the epidemic curve we know.
This reduces the risk of collapse in healthcare systems and spends more time on developing vaccines and treatments.
Non-drug interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures such asining hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-isolation; community measures aimed atining physical distance, such as shutdown of schools and cancellation of mass rallies; measures aimed at encouraging acceptance and participation in community actions of such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries and regions have also taken measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and local isolation measures and issued warnings about the activity trajectory of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to self-isolated infected persons, and imposes massive fines on infected persons who refuse to self-isolate.
China Taiwan has increased masks production and imposed penalties on suppliers of medical supplies that cover for sale. Simulations in the United Kingdom and the United States show that both mitigation (delaying but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the spread of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
The best mitigation policy could reduce peak medical demand by two-thirds, halve the number of deaths, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, causing the health system to collapse.
Suppression may be a priority, but it is necessary to maintain it until the virus stops spreading in the population (or until the vaccine is released, depending on who arrives first), or the spread will rebound quickly once the measures are eased.
Long-term interventions aimed at suppressing the epidemic can result in social and economic costs.
No special effects antiviral medication has been approved for COVID-19 yet, but research and development is underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking non-prescription cold pills, supplements and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusion and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can lead to worsening the situation.
A number of compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied to determine whether they are suitable for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also notes that some “traditional and home therapies” can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization points out that improving the treatment capacity and adjusting the healthcare system to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic response to the outbreak.
ECDC and the World Health Organization’s European Regional Offices have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including concentrating laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating selective procedures as far as possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19-positive patients, and enhancing the capacity for serious care by training personnel and increasing the number of available respiratory machines and beds.
Speculations about the origin of the first case (i.e. the so-called zero patient) differ.
The first known case of new coronavirus pneumonia may date back to December 1, 2019, in Hubei, Wuhan, China.
Within a month, cases of new coronavirus in Hubei province gradually increased.
These patients are mostly related to the South China Sea fresh wholesale market, which also sells live animals, a theory that the new coronavirus originates from one of the animals; or, in other words, that the disease originates from human animals. On December 26, Dr. Zhang of China-Western Medicine Hospital in Hubei Province first discovered and treated a group of unknown causes of pneumonia, and to Wuhan City's Jiangshan Disease Prevention and Control Center on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight doctors, including Li, were warned by the police for spreading " rumors", while another doctor, Affen, was warned by his superiors for sounding the alarm.
The Wuhan City Health Commission subsequently issued an announcement on December 31 and it to the World Health Organization.
The Wuhan Health Department launched an investigation in early January after receiving reports of numerous cases of unknown causes of pneumonia, with the number of cases doubling every seven and a half days at the beginning of the outbreak.
Between early January and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China under the influence of the massive population movement of the Chinese Spring Festival and Wuhan as a transportation hub and a major railway hub.
On January 20, China 140 new confirmed cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, confirmed cases in the United States exceeded those in China and Italy, becoming the country with the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. As of April 9, 2020, accumulated reports of confirmed cases worldwide exceeded 161 million; deaths exceeded 9,70,000 and cure exceeded 36,4 million cases.
Approximately 200 countries and regions worldwide have confirmed cases.
Influenced by the great popularity of Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have taken preventive measures to restrict the free movement of people and establish border controls.
National response measures include isolation (also known as residency, local asylum or blockade) and shutdowns. As of April 2, 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the total population, were in some form of blockade, more than 5,000,000 in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of blockade, and two days later that number rose to 2.6 billion, accounting for about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case dates back to 17 November.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang discovered a series of cases of unknown causes of pneumonia, and his hospital on December 27 the situation to Wuhan City's Jiangshan district disease prevention and control center.
On December 27, 2019, a group of SARS-like coronavirus was discovered in preliminary gene testing of a patient sample.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued an announcement on December 31,
Reported to the World Health Organization.
After these notifications were issued, several doctors in Wuhan City were warned by the police for walking out of the epidemic " rumors."

On January 30, when human transmission events were confirmed abroad and the number of cases increased in other countries, the World Health Organization announced the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the sixth international concern since the measure was implemented for the first time during the 2009 swine flu epidemic.
World Health Organization Director-General Tandesse pointed out that the determination of public health emergencies of international concern is based on “the risk of spreading globally, especially to poor health systems in low- and middle-income countries.”
Responding to the question of imposing travel restrictions, Tandesse said “there is no reason to take measures to unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and “the World Trade Organization does not recommend restricting trade and flow.”
On February 5, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on the international community to donate $6.5 billion to fund strategic readiness for low-income countries, saying there was an urgent need to support countries that “have no supporting systems to detect viruses.”

Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement: “This is a reality check for governments around the world: wake up.
The virus may be approaching, so be prepared,” and urged governments to take the right steps to avoid the world’s “worst situation.”
Ryan further noted that the current data is not enough to allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, which would mean “we basically recognize that everyone on the planet could be exposed to the virus.”
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization’s Director-General said it was “deeply concerned about the extent and severity of the disturbing spread and the reality of no action.”The World Health Organization has been heavily criticized for its alleged inappropriate handling of global popularity, including the delay in announcing public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.

International government organizations are actively addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive information, views and suggestions on the world’s policy responses in a timely manner.

Since the epidemic originally broke out in China's Hubei province, U.S. and British Cabinet Secretary Michael Goff and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bosonaro, Edward Bosonaro, criticized the Chinese government's handling.
Several provincial-level administrative officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed for improper handling of the prevention work in the China-China region, reflecting the central dissatisfaction with the epidemic response measures of local political institutions.
Some commentators believe the move aims to avoid public discontent with General Secretary Xi Jinping of the CPC Central Committee over the new coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Liang, have denied previously acknowledged COVID-19 outbreaks began with Wuhan’s remarks and supported conspiracy theories about the new coronavirus pneumonia originating in the United States or Italy.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the new coronavirus as “China virus” or “Wuhan virus,” saying China’s “censorship system has accelerated the spread of the virus, making it the current global pandemic,” which in turn has been viewed by some critics as racial discrimination and “displaced attention from the failure of its government to contain the virus.”
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the U.S. government that outlined a communications strategy clearly issued by the National Security Council, which said “all of this can’t be interfered with China.”
We are told to spread this information as much as possible by any means, including press conferences and television appearances.”Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg that China’s assistance to the epidemic countries is to promote its global influence.

Of course, this is not a good sign of European unity.”
On March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin, after speaking to Italian Prime Minister Conte, arranged for the Russian army to send military medicine, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The newspaper quoted an anonymous “high-level political official” as saying that 80 percent of Russia’s aid was “almost useless to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of launching a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm offensive.
Lombardy District Minister Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft carrying medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “When [Putin] provides assistance to American colleagues, he believes that once U.S. medical equipment and material manufacturers restore capacity, they will pay back if necessary.”
The Defender 2020 military exercises, scheduled in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Sea, are the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War.
Kate Hudson, Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Movement, criticized the Defense 2020 exercise: “At a time when the world is facing a public health crisis, the exercise poses a danger not only to the lives of the U.S. and many European military personnel involved, but also to the residents of the countries where the exercise is being conducted.”
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to leaders around the world asking for help. The letter noted that U.S. sanctions on Iran prevented Iran from entering the international market and made it difficult for Iran to fight the outbreak. The outbreak prompted parties to call on the U.S. to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid parental leave and improved public health funding.
Political analysts predict that the outbreak could have a negative impact on whether Donald Trump will win a re-election in the 2020 presidential election.The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have also worsened due to the global outbreak.
Japan announced that every person entering from South Korea would have to undergo two-week isolation at a government-designated location, and South Korea subsequently criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive sanitation measures."
South Korean society initially showed a bipolar attitude towards President Moon Jae-in’s crisis response measures.
Many South Koreans signed the petition, with some calling for impeachment, accusing the government of improper handling of the outbreak, and others praising his response strategy.
Some critics fear this could lead to the government’s strengthening control of power.
In Hungary, parliament voted in favour of Prime Minister Orban Viktor, who passed a decree that suspended parliament and elections for an indefinite period, and could also be punished if someone was found to have spread false information about the virus and government crisis management.
Multi-faceted supply shortages can be blamed for the new coronavirus outbreak, which comes from increased global use of equipment to fight the outbreak, panic shopping, and disruptions in factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Panic shopping has often occurred, leading to the emptying of food, toilet paper and bottled water on the shelves, causing a shortage of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has also been warning about delayed shipments of electronic products.
World Health Organization Director-General Tandesse said Volkswagen’s demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has resulted in the price of these products rising 20 times higher than usual, and the supply of medical supplies delayed by four to six months.
It also leads to a global shortage of personal protective equipment.The World Health Organization has warned that this would pose a threat to healthcare professionals.
In Australia, big-stream behavior buyers offer new opportunities to sell Australian products to China.
This activity led to a shortage of supermarket baby formula milk powder, which was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Although COVID-19 was very severe in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, there was no serious food shortage in both.
Measures taken by China and Italy to address key product storage and illegal trade practices have been very successful in avoiding serious food shortages, which are expected to occur in Europe and North America.
Agricultural output in northern Italy has not dropped significantly, but industry representatives believe prices could rise.
Food shelf emptying is only temporary, and even in Wuhan, Chinese government officials have released pork reserves to ensure adequate nutrition for residents.
Italy also has similar laws that require food producers to reserve supplies for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy has had an impact on China: A media report on March 16 that the Chinese economy suffered a huge shock in two months prior to 2020, under the influence of government measures to contain the epidemic, with retail sales falling by 20.5 percent.

According to Agathe Demarais of the Economist intelligence group, the markets will remain unstable until there is a clearer understanding of the possible consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the outbreak could have a more negative impact on global economic growth than the epidemic of 2002-2004.
An expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis estimates the impact of the epidemic on the global supply chain will be more than $3,000 billion, and could last for up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is “in a difficult situation” following the sharp fall in oil prices due to China’s declining demand.

The cruise industry has suffered unprecedented damage.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also forced to close.
The epidemic coincided with the Spring Festival, due to the Chinese Spring Festival holiday, which was originally an important tourist season.

Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions, including the Beijing Palace and traditional temples, were cancelled and closed to prevent massive crowds from gathering.
Of the 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China, 24 have extended the New Year's Day holiday until February 10, requiring most not to resume work before that date.
These regions account for 80 percent of the country’s GDP and 90 percent of its exports.
Hong Kong, China raised the level of infectious disease response to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, school shutdown until March, New Year's celebrations cancelled.
Retail sales in Europe and Latin America fell by 40 percent.
Retail sales in North America and the Middle East fell by 50-60%.
In addition, the outbreak also led to a 33-43% drop in shopping center traffic in March compared to February.
The operators of shopping centers around the world have taken additional measures, such as increasing sanitation facilities, installing heat scanners to measure the body temperature of shoppers, and cancelled some activities. According to the United Nations Latin American Economic Commission, the economic downturn caused by the epidemic could lead to an increased number of poor people in Latin America from 14 million to 22 million more than when the epidemic did not occur.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people were unemployed in China.
There are 300 million farm workers in China, many of whom are stuck in their homes in inland provinces or Hubei provinces.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans were unemployed and applied for government aid.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the new coronavirus outbreak could lead to an unemployment rate of 47 million people in the United States, which could reach 32 percent. India’s blockade has led to tens of millions (dayly paid) of Indian farmers unemployed. The Angstrid Institute survey found that 44 percent of Canadian families have experienced some form of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have been unemployed since the Spanish blockade in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for the General Benefit.
Both France and the United Kingdom have adopted the German reduced-time compensation scheme.
The performance and cultural industries have also been severely affected by the epidemic, and organizations worldwide, as well as employees and individuals, have failed to survive.
Art and cultural industry organizations strive to uphold their mission (often funded by the government) to showcase cultural heritage to communities, safeguard the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists as far as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, performing venues and other cultural institutions around the world will be shut down to varying degrees indefinitely, and exhibitions, events and performances will have to be cancelled or postponed.
In response to this situation, parties have begun to provide alternative services through digital platforms.The recent outbreak will also lead to the cancellation of many religious services, major sports and other social activities such as music festivals, concerts, technical workshops and fashion shows, and this negative impact will rapidly increase.
The film industry was also hit by the shock.The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week commemoration that would be held in Rome during the last week of the Christian Quarter.
Many dioceses recommend that elderly Christians stay at home without having to attend Mass on Sundays; some churches hold worship ceremonies via radio, live online or television, and some churches allow worship in cars.
Because the Roman Catholic district closed its large and small churches, Christian pilgrims were not seen in St. Peter's Square, and other religious groups cancelled or restricted worship or limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, Jewish churches, temples and martyrs.
The Iranian Ministry of Health has announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas, praying that the Holy Land was subsequently forced to close, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the Holy Land of Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic caused the world sports agenda the worst damage since World War II.
Most major sports events have been forced to be cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 Champions League, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 National Hockey Federation season.
The outbreak disrupted the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, scheduled for the end of July; the IOC announced on March 24 that the event would be “rearranged after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021”.
This has led to many gamblers turning to online gambling, and several online gambling sites have a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspended or cancelled the tour.
Many major theatres, such as the Broadway Theatre, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have also managed to continue to create and share works over the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as live concerts, or create a network of “festivals” for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works.
On the Internet, a number of new coronavirus-themed cyber fanatics spread, and in a moment of uncertainty spreading, many people began to turn to respond with humor and distracting attention.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, prejudice, xenophobia and racial discrimination against Chinese, East Asian, and populations from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries have increased.
There have been events of fear, suspicion and hatred in many countries and regions, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific.
Numerous reports in February this year (which at the time were mostly limited to China) documented racist attitudes across the globe against Chinese people that Chinese people should be infected with the virus or accept so-called legitimate retaliation.
Anti-China sentiment has also risen in some African countries.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and the Hubei region arely subjected to geographical discrimination.
Whether online or online, there is a voice in support of the Chinese people and the residents of the severely affected areas.
As the outbreak spread to other hotspots, Italy became the first country in Europe to have a severe outbreak of COVID-19, and populations from the country could also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea initially signed a petition requesting Chinese citizens to be banned from entering their country in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan theme has spread widely on Twitter.
Chinese, as well as other Asians in the UK and the United States, an increase in racial abuse and attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the new coronavirus a “Chinese virus” and critics say his remarks are racist and anti-Chinese.
Ukrainian protesters attacked a bus from Wuhan to New Sanzari carrying Ukrainian and foreign displaced persons.
Students from northeastern India (bounded with China) and studying in major Indian cities have alsoly been harassed by a new coronavirus outbreak.
Indian People's Party West Bangladesh Chairman Dilip Gosh said the Chinese destroyed nature, "so God will avenge them."
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, calling them "wrong."In China, non-Chinese residents suffered from xenophobic and racial discrimination as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and should be the target of "garbage handling".
Many newspapers with paid walls have removed the restrictions on some or all of the new coronavirus reports.
Many scientific publishers have published scientific papers related to the epidemic.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their findings on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing methods for respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include: testing for the presence of the virus and testing for the production of antibodies after infection.
RT-PCR detects the RNA of the coronavirus and thus determines whether the virus is present in the sample.
This test is specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It can be used to determine if you have recently been infected or if there is an active infection.
Antibody testing (serum testing) can be used for diagnosis and group monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected with the virus, including those with mild symptoms and no reports or no symptoms.
This test results can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease, as well as the level of immunity in the population.
Due to the limited number of detections, as of March 2020, no country/region has been able to provide reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country/region had more than 3 percent of its population, and there were huge differences between countries/regions.
This difference may also have a serious impact on cases of mortality, which may be severely overestimated in some countries.
Real-time reverse polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing with a throat wiping can only be completed within the first week after the virus is infected with reliable results.
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with a garlic can only be completed within the first week after infection.
The virus then disappears in the throat but continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons tested for the second week after infection, the sample can be replaced with a deep respiratory extract obtained through a sputum tube, or a cough outlet (sputum) can be used.
In January 2020, the rRT-PCR was released at the Charité Hospital in Berlin, one of the earliest PCR testing methods and the basis for the 250,000 test box distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test coronavirus (PowerChek Coronavirus) test box.
It searches for the “E” gene common to all β coronavirus, as well as the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp gene. In China, Huawei Gen (BGI Group) is one of the first companies to receive emergency approvals from the National Drug Administration of China for the production of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing test box. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to Public Health Labs through the International Reagents Resource Department.
Earlier versions of the test test box used three genetic testing methods, one of which resulted in a failure to determine the outcome due to a reagent defect, while the Atlanta CDC saw a bottleneck; which resulted in an average of less than 100 successful samples processed per day throughout February 2020.
The two-part testing method was not deemed reliable until February 28, 2020, when the state and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under emergency use authorization.U.S. Commercial Labs began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide from March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also announced that COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits have been announced; sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and produced by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research (VECTOR).
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered with the Russian Federal Health Regulatory Authority. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinicly developed a receptor box that can detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, a test method by Roche Diagnostics was approved by the FDA, which can complete a massive test in 3.5 hours, resulting in a device performing approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency License (EUA) for testing using Abbott’s m2000 systems to Abbott Laboratories; the FDA has previously issued similar licenses to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, an approximately 45-minute Cepheid testing method was also approved by the FDA for emergency use.
The FDA has approved a test method that uses a thermal expansion technique such as nucleic acid to replace PCR.
Since this method does not require a series of thermal cycles, a positive result can be obtained in just 5 minutes and a negative result can be determined in 13 minutes.
With about 18,000 such devices in the United States, Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a method of testing using monoclonal antibodies (specifically combined with the new coronavirus' nucleic shell protein (N protein)), hoping to deliver the results in 15 to 20 minutes like rapid flu detection.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that “in the early stages of the virus, the diagnostic value of the breastplate is small, and the performance of CT [computer rupture scan] may be noticeable, even before symptoms appear.”
Typical characteristics of CT include a double-pulmonary multicellular glass shade, with an outer peripheral asymmetry and a rear fabric.
As the disease progresses, manifestations, fragile pathways and pulmonary mutations will develop under the chest.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan (the place where the current epidemic originated) showed that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, but CT is less accurate and has many imaging features that overlap with other pneumonia and diseases.
By March 2020, the American Radiological Society recommended that “CT should not be used for screening COVID-19 or as a line-of-the-line testing tool for diagnosing COVID-19.”
Part of the immune response to infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect an individual’s infection about 7 days after the onset of symptoms to determine the immunity status of the monitored population. The measurement can be done in the central laboratory (CLT) or by instant testing (PoCT).
High-flow automated systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these measurements, but their availability depends on the productivity of the individual systems.
For CLT, while the immune response can be tracked by sequential samples, it is usually measured using an extracyclic blood sample.
For PoCT, a blood sample is generally obtained with a skin piercing.
No extraction steps are required before measurement, which is different from the PCR method.On March 26, 2020, the FDA approved 29 entity-declared testing methods, which are now able to distribute their antibody test box.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, the test test box of Ormon Medical Experimental Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics was approved in Europe for viral IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
With the detection capability to detect hundreds of samples in a matter of hours, virus RNA measurement is much faster than conventional PCR measurement.
Generally, antibodies can be detected 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the UK found that no one was useful enough in the antibody test box it purchased.
Hong Kong has established a mechanism to allow suspicious patients to stay at home, “the emergency room provides patients with sample tubes” and patients spit saliva into the tubes and then send the tubes back to receive results later on. NHS UK has announced that it is testing a program to detect suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infecting others when the patient goes to the hospital and eliminates the risk of having to disinfect the ambulance after using the ambulance.
In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurers said on March 2 that non-hospitals have the capacity to perform approximately 12,000 tests per day, compared to 10,700 in the previous week.
If the test is carried out at the doctor's request, the cost is covered by health insurance.
The director of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany said the total test capacity in Germany is 160,000 per week.
As of March 19, check-outs have been available in several major cities.
The total number of tests carried out in Germany as of March 26, 2020 is unknown, as only positive tests have been.
A preliminary laboratory survey showed that at least 483,295 samples (including the 12th week of 2020) were detected in total by the 12th week of 2020 and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for simultaneously detecting 64 patient samples, i.e. aggregate samples, and further testing only when the combined samples were found to be positive. In Wuhan, Wuhan, BGI temporarily established a 2,000-foot emergency testing laboratory called "Fire Eye", which was launched on February 5, 2020 and could be used to process more than 10,000 samples a day.
The laboratory was built in five days under the supervision of Wang Jiang, founder of the Chinese gene, and the modeling showed that unless the above-mentioned detection capabilities were achieved, Hubei's cases would be 47% higher, and the corresponding treatment isolation costs would double.
Following Wuhan Laboratory, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai immediately followed the establishment of fire eye laboratories, and currently 12 cities in China have established the laboratory.
As of March 4, 2020, a total of 50,000 laboratory tests per day will be conducted.Origami Assays’ open source, multi-route designs allow COVID19 testing for up to 1122 patient samples through 93 measurements alone. These balanced designs can operate in small laboratories without the need for automatic fluid transfers.
As of March, a shortage and insufficient quantity of reagents had become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the UK and the United States.
This led some initiators to explore a sample preparation scheme that involved heating the sample to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. The United Arab Emirates announced on March 31 that more populations have now been tested for the new coronavirus, more than any other country, and are expanding the level of testing to enable a large population to be tested.
The way to this detection capability is by using drive-through testing on the one hand, and by funding Group 42 and Huawei Genes (based on its "Fire Eye" emergency detection laboratory in China) to build high-volume laboratories to meet large-scale population detection needs.
Built in 14 days and capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day, the laboratory is the first in the world to operate on such a scale outside of China.
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed different methods of testing for different parts of the coronavirus gene chart.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the method of Germany’s production inspection test box, sending the test box to low-income countries that have no resources to develop their own.
The German method was announced on January 17, 2020; the program developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was available after January 28, limiting U.S. detection capabilities. Both China and the U.S. faced problems with the reliability of the detection box at the beginning of the outbreak, both countries and Australia failed to provide sufficient detection boxes to meet demand and recommendations from health experts.
In contrast, experts believe extensive testing in South Korea is helpful in reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Thanks to the detection capabilities established by the South Korean government over the past few years, it is mainly concentrated in private-sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for more testing as the best way to slow the development of the COVID-19 epidemic. The widespread spread of the virus has led to a huge demand for testing, which has led to hundreds of thousands of tests accumulated in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of wipes and chemical reagents has also begun to become tense.
In March 2020, China a problem with the accuracy of its test box.
In the United States, the CDC-developed test box had "defects"; then the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private laboratory testing. Spain purchased the test box from the Chinese company Shenzhen Irene Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and found the test results inaccurate.
The company explains that inaccuracies in the test results may be caused by improper collection of samples or by improper use of the test box.
The Spanish Cabinet said it would recycle the reactor box that returned the wrong results and replace it with another reactor box provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test boxes purchased by the Czech Republic from China were incorrect. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test boxes from China and found the results incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the boxes should be thrown into the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the boxes that Turkey bought from China were “high error rates” and did not “put them into use”.
Positive results can be achieved by testing and isolation of test-positive individuals and tracking the contact history of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals.
The researchers, who worked in the Italian city of Tucumán, the first place where COVID-19 patients died, tested a group of approximately 3,400 people in two rounds, with rounds of approximately ten days each.
Approximately half of those were positive and no symptoms, and all cases found were isolated.
By imposing travel restrictions on communities, new infections are completely eliminated.
By massively tracking contacts, restricting entry travel, detecting and isolating, 2020 coronavirus is infected in Singapore at a much slower rate than other developed countries/regions, and Singapore has not taken extreme restrictive measures, such as forcibly closing restaurants and retail venues.
Many events were cancelled in Singapore and residents were advised to stay home on March 28, but the school resumed classes on March 23 after the holidays.
Several other countries/regions, including Ireland and South Korea, have also controlled the epidemic by massively tracking contact persons, restricting entry travel, detection and isolation, and less radical blockade measures.
One statistical study found that the more countries were diagnosed compared to the number of deaths, the lower the case mortality rate, which may be why these countries were better able to detect groups with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with no detection capabilities and limited national laboratory experience in dealing with COVID-19 send their top five positive and top ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO comparison laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 symbiotic laboratories, seven are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the following chart, the "test positive%" is listed as the impact of the country's test policies.
In the same other circumstances, positive detection rates were higher than in countries that detected all citizens (regardless of whether they show symptoms) and in countries that detected only hospitalized people.
Hand washing, also known as hand cleansing, is the act of cleaning your hands to remove dust, oil, microbes or other unnecessary substances from your hands.
Insisting on washing hands with soap at certain “critical moments” of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which can all be spread through feces and mouth.
If people do not wash their hands before contacting their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common cold.
There are five key moments during the day to wash your hands with soap: before after discharge, after cleaning your child’s buttocks or after changing urethra, before feeding your child, before eating and after processing food or after processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
If there is no soap and water, you can clean your hands with grass ashes.The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands in the following situations:
Prepare food before, during and after.
Take care of the patient before.
After replacing the diaper or cleaning the buttocks of children such as the toilet.
Washing the nose, coughing or after spraying.
After touching animal, animal food or animal feces.
Hand hygiene refers to hygiene habits associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before medication or medical care prevents or minimizes the spread of disease.
In the medical field, the main purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can harm the human body or cause disease.
Handwashing is especially important for people who work in food processing or in the medical field, but for the general public, handwashing is also very important.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that improving hand washing habits had a slightly promoting effect on height increases in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality associated with respiratory and diarrhea diseases can be reduced by advocating simple behavioral changes (e.g. washing hands with soap).
This simple behavior can reduce mortality from these diseases by 50%.
This intervention advocating handwashing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea events by about a third, which is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap can reduce diarrhea incidents by 48%.As a spontaneous behavior in families, schools and communities around the world, washing hands with soap is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory infection, is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five, with pneumonia killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of 3.5 million children each year.
Compared to any single vaccine or medical intervention, washing hands with soap before and after meals can save more lives, reduce diarrhea-related deaths by half, and decrease acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
As part of the Water, Environmental Hygiene and Personal Hygiene (WASH) program, other sanitary interventions are often taken while advocating hand washing.
Hand washing can also prevent measles from spreading through direct physical contact.
Handwashing can have a slight adverse effect, which is that frequent handwashing can cause dry skin, causing skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing causes skin itching and cracks, known as hand rash or hand dermatitis, which is common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive disorder (OCD).
To reduce the spread of the disease, use soap during five key moments of the day to wash your hands: after the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning your child’s buttocks (change of urethra), before feeding your child, before meals and before processing food or after processing raw meat, fish or poultry.
To prevent the spread of disease, the right methods should also be used: before or after the treatment of the incision or wound; after the spray, coughing or rubbing of the nose; after touching animal feces or treatment of animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries/regions, the proportion of washing hands with soap is very low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households used soap to wash their hands. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest percentage of washing hands, up to 97%; the United States was close to the average, 77%; and China had the lowest percentage, 23%. Now, a number of behavioral changes have been implemented to advocate handwashing with soap at critical times.
The Philippine Ministry of Education’s Basic Health Care Program is an example of large-scale initiatives to promote children’s health and education.
At the heart of this national program is insecticide removal twice a year, accompanied by daily hand washing with soap and brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste.
This plan has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The integration of soap or detergent in the water can better clear the microbes on the skin.
The main role of soap and detergents is to reduce solubility barriers and improve solubility.
Water alone cannot effectively clean the skin because fat and protein (components of organic soil) are not easily dissolved in water.
Washing hands requires reasonable use of water.
Solid soaps may retain bacteria left behind during previous use because they can be reused.
A small number of studies have investigated the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps and have concluded that bacteria cannot be transferred because the bacteria are washed away by the foam.
But the CDC still claims “it’s best to choose non-contact liquid soaps.”
Antibiotic soap has been widely popularized among the healthy conscious masses.
So far, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant microbes in nature are selected using recommended antibacterials or disinfectants.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as trichlorine sand, trichlorine sand has a large number of resistant microbial strains.
Therefore, even if antimicrobial soap is not chosen for antibiotic-resistant strains, antimicrobial soap may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to surface activators and skin care agents, complex formulations may also contain acid (acetic acid, anti-depletion acid, lactic acid), antibacterial benzoate as pH regulators, as well as more skin conditioners (algae, vitamins, phenol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that ordinary soap has the same effect as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing trichlorine sand in the prevention of disease and removal of bacteria on the hands.
Hot water washing hands is comfortable, but its heat is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water in removing natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
Scientific research has confirmed that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbes in the hands, which is contrary to common belief.
Water-free handwashing or anti-bacterial handwashing is a non-water-based hand cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol-based hand cleaning agents (also known as alcohol rubbing, antibacterial rubbing, or anti-handwashing) were popular.
Most formulas of this type of handwashing contain ethanol or ethanol, then add condensers such as caprom (acrylic polymer) to form a gel, or add moisturizers such as glycine to form a liquid, or moisturize so that it is easy to use, and relieve the dry skin caused by alcohol.
Adding hydrogen peroxide after dilution can further increase antibacterial activity. Handwashes containing at least 60% to 95% alcohol can be effectively sterilized.
Alcohol rubbing hands can kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and antibacterial antibacterial bacteria (VRE), tuberculosis and a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory coronavirus (RSV), nasal virus, measles, flu and hepatitis) and fungi.
After 30 seconds of using a 70% alcoholic handwash, it kills 99.97% of the bacteria on your hands (reduced by 3.5 degrees, similar to reduced by 35 degrees), and after 1 minute of handwashing it reduces the bacteria on your hands by 99.99% to 99.999% (reduced by 4 to 5 degrees).
Alcohol rubbing hands has virtually no effect on viruses such as Norovirus (also known as Norwalk, Norwalk) (the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal inflammation). A sufficient amount of antibacterial rubbing hands or alcohol rubbing hands must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands.
Wash your hands and back, and between your fingers and the ends of all your fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips must also be thoroughly cleaned and the fingertips rubbed on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that it is best to wash hands instead of using a non-washing handspray, especially when the hands look dirty.
Because these kinds of rubbing hand lotions are easy to use and can rapidly deactivate microbes, they are increasingly used; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper handwashing unless there is soap and water available.
Frequent use of alcohol to wash hands can cause dry skin, unless the formula has added lubricants and/or moisturizers.
Glycine and/or other skin lubricants can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the dry skin caused by alcohol.
In clinical trials, compared with soap or antibacterial cleaning agents, alcohol-containing handwashes containing lubricants significantly reduce the occurrence of skin irritation and skin drying.
Allergic contact skin inflammation, contact measles syndrome or allergy to additives in alcohol or alcohol rubbing hands are rare.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, alcohol-free handwashes are less likely to induce irritable contact dermatitis, which is one reason for its appeal.
Although water-free cleaning agents are effective, they do not remove organic matter from the hands, but only disinfect them.
Therefore, handswash remedies are less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens than soap and water, because these pathogens are still on hand.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic handwashing depends largely on the composition and formula, and its effect has always been much worse than alcohol and alcohol rubbing handwashes.
Recently, the use of benzodiazepines has been proven to have persistent, cumulative antibacterial activity after use, this is different from alcohol, the effect of alcohol has been proven to be reduced after repeated use, probably due to the gradual cause of adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford to use soap instead of grass and ash.
Handwashing with water alone is better than grass and ash, but not soap.
One problem is that if the soil or grass ashes are contaminated by microbes, it may accelerate the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, grass ashes are also a disinfectant, as it forms alkaline solutions after water.
WHO recommends replacing soap with grass ashes or sand if no soap is available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following steps to prevent the spread of diseases:
Wash your hands with running hot or cold water.
Drinking water is recommended because the pool may be contaminated, and the water temperature seems to have little to do with it.
Use a sufficient amount of soap to rub repeatedly to produce foam, while washing the back of the hands, between the fingers and nail seams.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies have shown that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap rather than using water alone.
Wash for at least 20 seconds.
Wiping can produce friction, which helps remove the bacteria on the skin, the longer the wiping time, the more the bacteria are removed.
Clean thoroughly with running water.
Washing hands with water can cause re-pollution.
Dry with a clean towel or dry naturally.
Humid hands are more likely to be re-contaminated. thumbs, wrists, the area between fingers and nail seams are the most often overlooked areas.
Artificial nails and cracked nail oils may hide microbes.
It is often recommended to use moisturizers to avoid drying hands; drying the skin can cause skin damage, thereby increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
A range of low-cost measures can be provided to facilitate handwashing in developing countries where there is no access to tap water and/or soap, for example by pouring water through a hanging barrel or a hollow hose, and/or using grass ashes (where necessary).
The technique of easy water tap is very simple, with a rope hanging a water tank, and then pour out a small amount of water through a pedestal to the hand, and then use soap.
Effectively drying hands is an important step in the hand hygiene process, but there is still some debate about the most effective way to dry hands in public toilets.
More and more studies have shown that paper towels are more hygienic than the electric dry phones that many toilets offer.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium in the paper towel industry, comparing paper towels, hot-wind dry phones and more modern injection dry phones in terms of hygiene.
After washing hands with a warm-winded dry phone, drying hands found that the total amount of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194%, and the total amount of bacteria on the palms increased by an average of 254%.
With injection dry hands, the total amount of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42%, and the total amount of bacteria on the palms increased by an average of 15%.
After washing hands with a paper towel, the total bacterial volume on the fingers was reduced by an average of 76 percent, and the total amount of palm bacteria was reduced by an average of 77 percent.
Injectable dry phones are said to blow out air at 180 meters per second (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour) and can blow off microbes on hands and body, potentially contaminating other toilet users and toilet facilities within 2 meters.
Using hot-winded dry phones can spread microorganisms to a distance of 0.25 meters from dry phones.
The results of the use of paper towels showed no serious microbial spread. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate different ways of drying hands.
After drying hands, the following changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
The study involved many different dry phone manufacturers, comparing these dry phones to dry hands with paper towels.
During the trip, without soap and water, you can choose to wash your hands with hand disinfecting towels.
The alcohol content of handwash should be at least 60%.
The Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered in 1846 that hand washing was effective in preventing the spread of diseases within hospitals, but it was not long after that that medical personnel were compelled to wash their hands.
Hospitals use electronic devices that can provide feedback to alert hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found a decrease in infection rates after using these devices.
Medical professionals should wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, using enough soap and water or gel to produce foam and rub each part of the hand.
The fingers rub each other.
If there are residue between the nail seams, it can be cleaned with a hard brush.
Since the residual moisture on the hands may still contain bacteria, it must be thoroughly cleaned and dried with a clean towel.
After drying, the taper should be closed with a paper towel (if necessary, use a paper towel to open the exit door).
This prevents the hand from contaminating again due to contact with these surfaces.
In healthcare institutions, hand washing is intended to eliminate pathogenic microbes (“bacteria”) and avoid spreading.
Reports in the New England Journal of Medicine show that in most medical settings, hands washing still does not reach acceptable levels, and a large number of healthcare professionals often forget to wash their hands before contact with patients, leading to the spread of microbes.
One study showed that proper handwashing, combined with other simple procedures, could reduce the rates of conductus-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.
The organization has also published draft hand health guidelines on its website to obtain public opinion.
Whitby and others reviewed the matter.
If regulatory compliance is required, commercial equipment can be measured and verified for hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization recommends five “moments” to wash your hands:
After contact with blood/body fluid
Before the operation and
After taking care of the patient, adding antibacterial chemicals to soap (“soap” or “antibacterial soap”) can cause the handwasher to have an antibacterial effect.
Before the operation or in an environment with a large number of antibiotic-resistant microbes, this operation may be necessary. When doing the operation and "wash" hands, there must be a contact-free waterhead, chlorinated or magnesium-containing handwash, sterile towels for drying hands after washing, sterile brushes for washing and other sterile tools for cleaning nails.
All the jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands, the forearm to the elbow, usually for 2–6 minutes.
No need to wipe for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, it is necessary to prevent the water from the front arm from flowing back to the hand.
After washing your hands, dry your hands with a sterile cloth and wear a surgical cloth.
In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, it is best to wash hands before contact with the patient or use antimicrobial handwash.
In order to control grapefruit infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands comes when the frequency of washing hands reaches 20%, and the further benefit is extremely limited when the frequency of cleaning hands increases to more than 35%.
Compared to using antibacterial soap, ordinary soap handwashing can result in a more than three-fold increase in the proportion of bacterial infectious diseases that spread to food. After comparing handwashing with antibacterial soap and handwashing with antibacterial soap (30 seconds respectively), the percentage of bacterial infections with alcoholic handwashing was 26% lower than with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores than alcohol rubbing hands. Healthcare facilities can improve hand hygiene by training employees on how to wash their hands, increasing the supply of alcohol rubbing hands and interventions such as written and verbal reminders to employees.
Further research is needed on which interventions are most effective in various medical settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered a cost-effective tool for achieving health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people’s homes, schools and workplaces poses a challenge to popularize hand washing.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, even if there are inexpensive methods to build a toilet, it is very rare to have a hand washer near every private toilet or public toilet.
However, low frequency of hand washing may also be due to a deep-rooted habit, not a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating the use of soap handwashing can influence policy making, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioral changes in residents.
To be effective, monitoring and evaluation must be carried out.
A systematic evaluation of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of the UNICEF’s “Samsung approach” to advocate hand washing in schools was to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can rise from one star to the highest three stars.
Handwashing promotions may include the construction of toilets to reduce disease and child mortality.
Another example of raising awareness of handwashing activities is World Handwashing Day, which aims to try to behavioral change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic, the UNICEF promoted the use of a handwashing expression symbol.
Few studies have examined the relationship between the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing and the avoidance of disability adjusted lifespan years (DALY) in developing countries.
However, there are reports that advocating handwashing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The first to recognize the importance of handwashing for human health—especially for those who are physically weak (e.g. mothers who have just given birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers) were two pioneers in the field of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the British “founder of modern nursing” Florence Nightingale.
At the time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by the bad smell known as helium poison.
The outbreak of food-borne diseases and medicinal-borne infections in the 1980s prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively advocate hand hygiene, stressing that hand hygiene is an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic have made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect people from these infectious diseases.
For example, German public toilets, office buildings and airport toilets will be covered with posters called “The Right Way to Wash Hands.”
"Handwashing" means someone declaring that they are unwilling to be responsible for something or not willing to be involved in something.
It derives from the content in the Bible of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus, and later evolved into a widespread usage in some English-speaking groups.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins forcibly washing her hands for trying to clear the dirt in her imagination, indicating her guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes of spoiling her husband.
Studies have shown that people who think of or imagine immoral behavior tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value handwashing facilities more.
Furthermore, those who could wash their hands after imagining immoral behavior were less likely to engage in other “purifying” compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religion requires handwashing for sanitary and symbolic purposes. The symbolic handwashing with water while washing but without soap is part of many religious iconic handwashings, including Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilat Yadayim, Handwashing in Christianity, and Purification in Islam. Religion also prescribes handwashing in terms of health, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before meals.
COVID-19 Prevention in the Workplace
COVID-19 Workplace Prevention refers to the use of preventive and controlled occupational safety and health measures to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Whether workplace risk prevention and control is appropriate depends on the specific workplace and work tasks and should be determined on the basis of the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of community disease and the risk factors of individuals susceptible to exposure to COVID-19.
According to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work is the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues, and therefore it is recommended to take basic infectious prevention measures, including proper handwashing, encouraging employees to stay isolated after illness, adhering to breathing rituals, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Moderate exposure involves the need for frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients who may become infected by continued community spread or international travel.
This includes exposure to staff in the general public, such as schools, high-population working environments and some large-scale retail environments.
In addition to basic preventive measures, the group should also use efficient air filters and spray protection devices for ventilation, wear personal protective equipment when exposed to patients with COVID-19 and take other hazardous preventive measures.
OSHA believes that there is a high risk of exposure for healthcare personnel and dormitory staff who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and that the risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff performed aerosol-generating operations on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or samples were collected or processed from them.
Hazard prevention measures applicable to such persons include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for their work tasks.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have serious effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent due to illness, need to take care of others, or fear of exposure.
Business models may also change, including changing demand for goods or changing ways to get those goods (such as shopping in non-peak hours, or using distribution or free shipping services).
Finally, product logistics from severe COVID-19 outbreak areas may be interrupted. Infectious disease prevention and response plans can be used to guide protection actions.
These programs address risk levels associated with a variety of workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors from home and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers, such as elderly people or groups with chronic diseases.
These plans also outline preventive and control measures necessary to address these risks, as well as emergency plans for cases that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease prevention and response plans may require compliance with national or local recommendations.
Targets to address outbreaks include reducing spread between employees, protecting populations at higher risk of poor health complications,ining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in the supply chain.
In addition, the response measures will also be affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the enterprise is located.
Hazard prevention and control level is a prevention and control framework widely used in occupational safety and health, used to group hazard prevention and control measures according to effectiveness.
If the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective control measures are engineering control, followed by administrative control, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control refers to isolating employees from work-related hazards rather than relying on their behavior to control, which is also the lowest-cost solution to implement.
Administrative control refers to changing work policies or procedures that require employees or employers to act on their own.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is less preventative than engineering and administrative controls, but helps prevent some exposures.
All types of PPEs must be selected according to the level of danger faced by the staff, equipped as appropriate (such as respirators) and must always be properly worn, regularly inspected andined, replaced if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or handled to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work is the least occupational exposure to the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all workplaces take basic measures to prevent infections, including proper handwashing, to advise sick employees to stay isolated, to observe breathing procedures when coughing or spraying, provide towels and garbage cans, prepare for remote offices, go to work when necessary, prevent employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and keep the workplace daily clean and disinfected.
Timely identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is key to protecting employees, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory symptoms should be isolated for at least 24 hours until there is no fever, fever or any other symptoms, and that sick leave policies should be implemented flexibly, allowing employees to stay at home to care for the affected family and should be clearly informed of the policy.
According to OSHA, moderately exposed work involves the need for frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients within a range of 6 feet (1.8 meters), but can lead to individuals infecting SARS-CoV-2 due to continued community spread near the workplace or due to recent possible visits to COVID-19 outbreak areas.
These types of staff include working in schools, in high-density working environments and in a number of large-scale retail environments. Engineering control measures for this group and high-risk groups include installing efficient air filters, improving ventilation, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic spray protection devices, and providing customer services with drop-down windows. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk groups include encouraging sick employees to stay in isolation, using virtual communication instead of face-to-face meetings, establishing peak classes, eliminating unnecessary trips to COVID-19 explosion sites, developing emergency communication plans, including forums to answer staff questions, providing staff with up-to-date training on COVID-19 risk factors and protection behavior, and providing training on how to use protective clothing and equipment for employees who need to use protective clothing and protective equipment, providing assistance to improve the personal health and work environment, washing requirements, restricting their access to the public’s workplace, clothes, clothes and other specific tasks.
Such personnel are best equipped with respirators.
If someone is ill on board the aircraft, appropriate precautions should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including placing the patient at a distance of 6 feet from other passengers, designating a crew member to serve the patient, providing the patient with a mask, or asking the patient to cover his mouth with a towel when coughing or spraying.
Crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick travellers, touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces.If sick travellers experience symptoms such as fever, persistent coughing or breathing difficulties, crew members should also wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other single-use items should be handled in biologically hazardous bags, and the contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard prevention measures also include delaying travel when ill. If there is a fever or other symptoms on board, it should be self-isolated and immediately notified to the medical room on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the isolated room. For schools and child care facilities, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommend that the corresponding schools and child care facilities be shut down for a short time and thoroughly cleaned or disinfected if an infected person has ever appeared in the school, regardless of the spread of the community.
For medium-low community spread, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of other large gatherings such as field visits, gatherings and sports classes, choir classes or self-service dining, increasing the distance between the tables, peak arrivals and departure, limiting unnecessary visits, and arranging separate health offices for children with flu-like symptoms.
In addition to implementing social distance strategies, if the community spreads seriously, an extended stop time may also be considered. For law enforcers carrying out daily routine activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the immediate health risks they face to be lower.
It is recommended that law enforcement personnel who are in contact with COVID-19-confirmed patients or suspected individuals act on the same level of protection as emergency medical technicians, including equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during the process of arrest, staff should first clean and disinfect their belt and equipment before using a household cleaning spray or after cleaning, and must comply with standard personal protective equipment sealing and handling procedures and clothing sealing and cleaning procedures.
OSHA believes that some healthcare and hospital staff are at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk personnel include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who are actually exposed to or suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes extremely high if staff perform sputtering procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collect or process samples of infected or suspected infected persons.
Sputum-generating procedures include inserts, cough induction procedures, respiratory inspections, some dental procedures and examinations, or body cavity sampling.
High-risk space staff include staff involved in the recovery of dead bodies, who are confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 in life; exposure risks are higher if the bodies are carried out anatomically. Additional engineering measures needed for this risk group include a room prepared for the confirmation or suspected cases of COVID-19, including when performing splash generation procedures.
Some healthcare facilities and bodyguards can also be equipped with specialized negative pressure ventilation systems.
Level 3 biosecurity precautions should be taken when processing the specimen.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends different waiting zones for patients based on whether patients are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (WHO) also recommends that people who work within a 6-foot range of patients who are known or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform splash-generating procedures wear a respirator.
The United States requires the use of N95 filter masks or better masks approved by NIOSH in the context of comprehensive written respiratory protection programs such as health tests, training, medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and improve staff comfort.WHO does not recommend wearing protective clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and does not spread through body fluids.
The WHO recommends that screener at the entry point wear only medical surgical masks.
For personnel who need to take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 and provide care or transfer services to patients without performing sputum-generating procedures, the WHO recommends using medical surgical masks, eyeglasses or masks, coats and gloves.
If a sputum-generating procedure is to be performed, the medical surgical mask must be replaced with the N95 or FFP2 mask.
Given the global supply of personal protective equipment, the WHO recommends measures such as using physical barriers such as remote medical care, transparent windows, allowing direct caregivers to enter the rooms of COVID-19 patients only, using personal protective equipment only when specific tasks are indeed necessary, continuing to use the same respirator when treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis results, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and not encouraging people without symptoms to use masks to reduce the need for personal protective equipment.

Since this month we have encountered some difficult situations.
In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, we clearly feel that the fate of all humanity is shared, and at the same time recognize our responsibility to each other.
We face unprecedented challenges, but we know that the best way to deal with these challenges requires people around the world to feel sympathized, work together and build communities, which is the core idea of Wikimedia.
The transmission of friendship and care among all our colleagues through e-mails, phones and chats fully demonstrates the extraordinary quality of our colleagues, and how fortunate we are to work with you.
I am immensely grateful and proud to be a colleague with you.
Last week, someone praised our work.
They made me realize how meaningful it is that Wikipedia is available to the world right now, and at the same time made me realize the symbolic power this critical resource brings to people around the world to keep running properly.
Whether your job is to run the website, pay salaries, or community security, Wikimedia works well.
The world now needs more information from Wikipedia than ever.
At this stage, the content of our work and even the way we work will have a significant impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and the burden of our colleagues, we will make some significant adjustments to the way we collaborate from next week.
Adjustment of working methods and timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the executive team met last night to discuss how the company will work and schedule for the next few days to months.
At the meeting, we considered what we believe is an appropriate response to the current challenges facing the company, as well as the best practices to ensure that the company remains sustainable during the epidemic.
The executive team agreed to reduce the pressure on the company’s employees, so that everyone can sustain the company’s mission.
We support you to reduce work pressure appropriately.
For all employees, contractors and contractors:
Our daily working hours will be adjusted to 4 hours a day (or 20 hours a week) and will be notified separately if any changes are made.
This adjustment is not a holiday notice. If you can work longer hours a day, we will arrange tasks for you according to your working hours.
However, given the unpredictability of the current world situation, we will prioritize your personal needs, such as taking care of your family, going shopping or visiting a doctor.
We will not track your working hours.
If you are sick, please let go of work.
Although this is obvious, we would like to remind you, please rest assured.
You don’t need to apply for sick leave or paid leave, but you need to inform your manager and help your team adjust work schedules and schedules to ensure that critical work areas are not affected.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 positive, please tell Bryan of Talent and Culture Operations, who will provide you with support and ensure that your situation is properly monitored by the management.)
For hourly employees, we will pay the full salary.
We have already expressed and reiterated our commitment to deliver on our commitments to contractors and our hourly workers.
The salary we pay to all will continue to be calculated on the basis of their remuneration for completing their normal working hours.
Even if you are sick or unable to work is no exception.
If you are willing to work, we will support you.
Many people choose to communicate with the outside world through work and release their own pressure.
Our work can bring incredible returns, especially at times like this.
But taking care of yourself is the first.
We ask you to keep in touch with the manager so that we are aware of your latest situation and make adjustments accordingly.
Prioritize important work.
We need to maintain the normal functioning of some important tasks.
The work of site reliability engineering teams, human resource operations teams, trust and security teams, and fundraising teams (and other teams) is critical and may require additional support.
We will start evaluating current project targets with all departments and shift our focus to supporting some of the issues that are critical to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all need to focus on the most important projects.
A temporary slowdown will not affect future development.
We don’t intend to “shut down” after the epidemic.
We will not ask you to go on overtime because it seems unrealistic now.
We accept that the current environment has changed and we will set new goals and timetables as appropriate.
What will the App (Annual Plan) change?
In order to adapt to the new realities and daily working hours requirements, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for the 2020-2021 plan.
We would like to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan in exchange for more time spent on budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize key tasks and take care of themselves and their families, while adjusting the schedule for employees who need or want to reduce their workload in the coming weeks.
Extended schedules can significantly reduce the current scheduled workload across the organization and reduce the workload.
We will submit the above proposals to the Board of Directors next week.If the proposal is approved, we will update the follow-up schedule to our representatives and teams as soon as possible.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this process.
Office Conditions, Exposure and Cleaning
Last week, we learned that a colleague in a San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But, out of caution, we hired some anti-virus cleaners to complete the San Francisco office disinfection.
They use hospital-grade disinfection solutions to disinfect various surfaces, as well as the halls and elevators that lead to our floors.
The office building is fulfilling its attention obligation agreement, using the corresponding products to ensure the safety of tenants.
We believe that when you decide to return to work, the office is fully prepared to welcome you.
Our Washington D.C. offices use WeWork’s offices, and WeWork shares the COVID-19 agreement with us and all of our staff in Washington D.C.
As of last week, the Washington D.C. office had moved to a full-time remote office in accordance with the guidelines we shared with the San Francisco office.
At the same time, as some of our colleagues in the New York office already know, we have been discussing issues related to renting offices in the Brooklyn district.
These discussions are still ongoing, but may be postponed.
Some of my colleagues were in contact for the first time at a remote office.
Other colleagues in long-term remote offices would like to give these colleagues some suggestions on how to adjust their way of working:
The meeting time should be controlled within one to two hours.
If it takes longer, consider scattering the meeting content across multiple dates.
Clearly define the goals of the conference, formulate the agenda of the conference, and send reading materials in advance.
Use video conferences as your default meeting method while using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to collaborate and connect online.
In each meeting, arrange a host to preside over the meeting, arrange one to monitor questions in the chat window and track changes in the speaker list, and arrange another to assist (or collaborate with multiple people) in recording the meeting.
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to contact the technical support department.
Use your health subsidy to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss distributed work with colleagues
The Human Resource Operations team is working on human engineering guidance in the form of a webinar to help all of Foundation’s colleagues improve their productivity during distributed offices.
Last week, we asked all community recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as Editorial Pan, before the WHO announced the end of the outbreak.
These demands for cancellation of activities and other restrictions may result in these community recipients unable to complete their original donation activities, and we have informed them that we understand this and also promise that none of them will be punished for delaying or modifying those goals.
In the coming week, we will continue to provide more guidance at Wikimania and other local community meetings and thematic community meetings.
The global community seems to be overwhelmed by the sadness that the outbreak has caused, but it also reflects relief from being able to clearly keep an eye on their respective communities, Wikimedia, and others.
In the future, the CRT team will build a page on Meta-Wiki that will provide the community with a space to monitor impact and track the community’s interactions with us.
Stay in touch and communicate about COVID-19
We are scheduled to hold a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 (Coordinated World Time) at 07:00 (Pacific Time) and we will subsequently send invitations to your calendar.
At the meeting, we will share some of the latest developments, answer your questions and leave some time for discussions.
We are united and here we are willing to help you.
At the same time, you can learn more about the information mentioned in this email and other important information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT team will update these pages in a timely manner and concentrate all the information in one place.
We are trying to maintain regular communication with employees living in countries/regions currently severely affected by the outbreak.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, major workflows or insurance, or need other assistance, contact the CRT team and work with it at any time.
We are here to provide you with the support and contact you need.
If you have confidential or sensitive questions, send an email to Bryan Judan, Head of Global Human Resources Operations.
While we face these changes, we cannot give up our jobs and obligations as a result.
Instead, this outbreak has made us realize that we may now need to adjust our work and responsibilities in ways that have not been seen before.
We believe these measures are necessary to support each other in continuing to work, to provide the support we need for our actions, and to continue to deliver the services they depend on to the world.
Make a plan and don’t be afraid of challenges.
Now, please support each other to create space for important work in the coming weeks or even months.
We need everyone to contribute to this goal, so please take care of yourself and your family to stay in the best condition when needed.
Finally, please carefully wash your hands and do not touch your face.
Katherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and other members of the lead team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jane U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N) paid tribute.
Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2, ACE2, is an enzyme attached to the cellular surface (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 suppresses the activity of the Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the levels of vascular stressor II and increasing the levels of Ang(1-7) and is expected to be a drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also an entry point for certain coronaviruses to enter cells.
The genetic version of this enzyme is commonly referred to as hACE2.
Vasoconvulsant conversion enzyme 2 is a zinc metal enzyme located on the surface of endocrine cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-end propionate M2 structural domain and a C-end Collectrin renal amino acid transfer protein structural domain.
ACE2 is a monocellular type I membrane protein whose enzyme-active structural fields are exposed to the cellular surface of the lungs and other tissues.
Another enzyme called sheddase dissolves the extracellular area of ACE2 from the intermembrane structure, releasing the resulting soluble protein into the bloodstream and eventually excreting it into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes, mainly type II pulmonary cells in the lungs, intestinal supercells in the small intestine, arterial and intravenous cells in most organs, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression was also found in the cortex, tetanus, hippocampus and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to balance ACE.
ACE dissolves vascular tensionin I into vascular tensionin II with vascular contraction activity.
ACE2 subsequently dissolves the asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into a vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also crack down many other titanium types, including dexamethasone 9 retardant titanium, apelin, neurodepressant, potassium A, and stomach hunger.
ACE2 can also regulate membrane transport of the neutral amino acid-transporting protein SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main gateway for certain coronaviruses to enter cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2’s S1 thyroproteins bind to the enzyme structural fields of ACE2 on the cell surface, resulting in intramuscular action, allowing viruses and enzymes to co-locate into the nucleus in the cell.
This entry process also requires the activation of the S-protein triggered by TMPRSS2 and is currently being studied whether it can be suppressed as a potential treatment. Some speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continued use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
A systematic evaluation and metaanalysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the control group.”
Furthermore, for patients at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, ACE inhibitor treatment also reduces the risk of pneumonia.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, but the results were not as reliable as reducing the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Human restructuring ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new approach to treating acute lung injury that appears to improve pulmonary blood flow dynamics and blood oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by lipid polysaccharide.
rhACE2 has a half-life in the human body of approximately 10 hours, a start-up time of 30 minutes and an action process (duration) of 24 hours.
Some studies suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibitors or for diseases with elevated levels of circulatory-vascular stressor II. RhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The b’COVID-19 app is a mobile software designed to address the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak by helping track close contacts and identify individuals who may have been exposed to the infection (“contact persons”).
Several regions and jurisdictions have developed or proposed many applications with the support of official governments.
Many frameworks for building close contact tracking apps have been established.
Privacy issues also raise a number of concerns, especially when some systems need to track the geolocation of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the distance between users and other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate this Bluetooth-enabled feature directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government and Paypal have jointly developed an app to help citizens check whether they have been exposed to COVID-19 patients.
The program is currently in use in more than 200 cities in China, while Singapore has launched an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community and released as open source software and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called “StopKorona!” to track exposure of potential infected persons and help healthcare institutions respond quickly.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology of North Macedonia and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the close-to-contact tracking app has entered an advanced stage of development and will be put into use in the coming weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering developing similar apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to launch a geo-barrier app for COVID-19-confirmed patients living in Moscow to ensure that patients don’t leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists some of the practical problems that an application system may have, including false-positive false reports, and the potential lack of effectiveness if only a small percentage of people use the app.
To prevent the spread of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple has set restrictions on the types of organizations that can publish coronavirus-related applications in the Apple App Store, which is limited to “official” or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the use of large-scale surveillance of coronavirus applications, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus outbreak should be dismantled after the threat of the outbreak has been eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
These organizations have declared eight conditions that government projects must meet:
Surveillance must be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The extension of monitoring and monitoring must include the "sunset" clause;
The data collected is only used for COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymous information must be protected and there must be evidence that it is effectively protected.
Digital surveillance must avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization.
Any data sharing with third parties shall be defined by law;
Guarantees must be provided to prevent data abuse and to provide citizens with the right to respond to data abuse.
All “relevant stakeholders” are called for “effective involvement”, including requiring public health experts and marginalized groups to participate. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued verification lists.
Google/Apple’s proposed plan aims to address the problem of ongoing monitoring, removing it from the device operating system once it no longer needs tracking.
In some countries, location tracking is based on the network rather than the application, and users do not have to download the app and avoid being tracked.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to original location data may have serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server require access to personal location data; many privacy protection systems that only use the central server to communicate with each other have now been created (see details below).
South Korea has launched a non-app-based system to perform contact tracking tasks.
The system does not use a dedicated application, but instead chooses to collect tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and then combine that information to send notifications to potential infected persons via text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential close contacts, the government was also allowed to disclose location information as the country made major changes to its information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites.There are other countries, including Germany, that are considering using centralized systems and privacy protection systems at the same time.
As of April 6, 2020, no specifics have been announced.
Privacy protection close contact tracking is a recognized concept, with a large number of relevant research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are studying privacy protection solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) to record the distance between users and other phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordinated program that includes centralized and decentralized approaches, not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy protection neighboring tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly called contact event numbers, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols and mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT).
Under these protocols, personally identifiable data will never leave the device, and all matching is done on the device.
The privacy team at MIT Media Lab has been developing the SafePaths platform, which uses privacy protection technology to collect and use location or cross-path data to track COVID-19.
The platform is based on the research content of the white paper “Application Independence: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic” published in March 2020. In addition, Enigma MPC, a company originally founded at MIT Media Lab and dedicated to privacy technologies, is also developing a similar platform called SafeTrace.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, groups joined forces around basically identical approaches and fundamentally overlapping protocols to form the Global TCN Alliance with the aim of reducing fragmentation of information and supporting global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, which is key to widespread applications.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that its official government application uses the open source BlueTrace protocol.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced a close-to-contact tracking plan, claiming that the plan combines low-power Bluetooth technology with privacy-protected encryption technology to play a role in protecting privacy.
In addition, they also released the core technical specifications used in the system.
Apple and Google said the system plans to launch in three stages:
Introduce tools to support governments in creating official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
By integrating this feature directly into iOS and Android systems, Google and Apple plan to launch the system first with an operating system update, and will remove the system in the same way after the epidemic threat to solve subsequent monitoring issues.
Drug repositioning (also referred to as drug reuse, re-evaluation, redistribution or therapeutic conversion) refers to the conversion of an approved drug for other uses in order to treat a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is a research line currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research areas include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and recovery plasma transfusions.SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 proteins that can be used for medicinal purposes, each with multiple receptor binding points.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable solution for the development of effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include peppermint proteinase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, decylenase, S-protein, and ADP diphosphatease.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several candidate compounds, then optimized and analyzed the skeletal similarities of these candidate compounds against the highest similarity levels of approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in their pre-clinical trials and recommend them in clinical study designs.

Large-scale research is underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The Longneys School of Medicine at the University of New York is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of phosphorus-based chloride.
Clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen in China have shown that Fapilavir is “evidently effective.”
In Shenzhen, 35 patients turned negative in an average of 4 days, while 45 patients who were not treated with the drug lasted 11 days.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received Fapilave and the other half received Abidol.

It may be unsafe for pregnant women or pregnant persons to use this medicine.
A study of Kaletra (a combination of antiviral drugs Lopinave and Litonave) concluded that "no benefits were observed."
These drugs are designed to inhibit the replication of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) by combining with proteinases.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drug to find compounds that can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 proteinase. The scientific community has been criticized for reusing resources for drugs developed specifically for HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
The World Health Organization has included Lopinave/Litonave in the international solidarity trial.
Reddit was created and developed by Gillette Sciences Corporation for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Gillette Sciences Corporation later discovered that Reddit has antiviral activity in the outer body against a variety of silica viruses, pneumonia viruses, adenovirus and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral therapy is that resistance generated by mutations can lead to more serious diseases and spread.
Several early pre-trial studies suggest that Reddit may have a higher resistance genetic barrier. Several clinical trials are currently underway, two of which are conducted by the University Hospital of Cleveland; one for patients with moderate symptoms, and another for patients with more severe symptoms.
There are currently three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C injection in patients with severe COVID-19 hospitalization; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one non-controlled trial (Italy).

b'A COVID-19 vaccine refers to the hypothetical vaccine for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 2019.
Although no clinical trials have been completed, several attempts to develop the vaccine are still underway.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said there would be no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 in the next 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates entered Phase I safety studies.
Covid-19 was discovered in December 2019.
In 2020, a massive outbreak spread worldwide, triggering massive investments and research in vaccine development.
Many organizations are using the released viral genomes to develop possible SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
CEPI presented its vaccine development plan in April and said the priorities were speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global accessibility.
In April, CEPI scientists that 10 different technology platforms are researching and developing effective COVID-19 vaccines by early 2020.
The main platform targets for entry into Phase I safety research include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Developer of Phase I and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carriers (Developers and vaccine candidates of Phase I: CanSino Biologics, 5 adenovirus carriers)
CEPI scientists in April that a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed to be ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute data), and 37 have been announced, but almost no public information (hypothesis is being planned or designed).
Phase I-II trials conducted preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled multi-point trials, while determining a more accurate and effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of vaccines for disease prevention while monitoring adverse reactions at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates actively developed (confirmed by early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (still in pre-clinical trials).
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was exploring the potential for a molecular tinnitus vaccine that could genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune responses.

On March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it will get pre-clinical test results in April 2020, with its final vaccine candidate likely to start testing in humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020, in France, the Epidemiological Prevention Innovation Alliance (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment to establish a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance comprised of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI’s total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to $29 million.
Other CEPI partners in COVID-19 vaccine research and development include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing on six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at the Imperial Institute of Technology in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-expanding RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving a virus sequence released in China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced an allocation of $2.75 billion to fund 96 medical response research projects for COVID-19, including numerous candidate vaccines from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan programs.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced that it will invest $1.9 billion in the development of COVID-19 vaccines and plans to establish a national “vaccine repository” including several new vaccines so that these vaccines can be put into use when a new coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine a test of PittCoVacc, a COVID-19 vaccine that could be used in mice, and said that “the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunity vaccine provided by the MNA allows [mice] to produce strong antigen-specific antibody responses that begin to appear two weeks after immunization.”
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmaceutical School of Canada announced the design of a DNA-based candidate vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
The researchers used phages to design DNA to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which could stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities will gather resources and combine cloud computing resources from HP, Amazon, Microsoft and Google to access IBM’s supercomputers.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that in addition to preventing diseases, they also offer other benefits.
Further randomized trials in Australia are recruiting 4,170 healthcare professionals.
Vaccines in development may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2 genetically modified mice, other experimental animals and non-human primates, to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines suggested the need for Level 3 biosecurity restrictions to treat live viruses and international coordination to ensure compliance with standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there are no safe and effective SARS treatments or preventive vaccines.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is an urgent task for governments and public health agencies around the world.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, existing SARS studies were believed to provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and therapies for MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I human clinical trials, with three vaccines under development, all of which are virus-carrying vaccines, two glandular virus-carrying vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-MERS-S.
Various social media articles have fostered conspiracy theories, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been found and vaccines are already available.
The patents cited in various social media articles refer to existing coronavirus (such as SARS) genetic sequences and vaccines.
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include nausea, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The incubation period from contact with the patient to the onset of the disease varies from 2 to 14 days, usually about 5 days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some may develop into viral pneumonia and multi-organ dysfunction.
As of April 17, 2020, the total number of cases in 210 countries and regions worldwide exceeded 224 million, with more than 153,000 deaths.
Currently, more than 568,000 people have been recovered from treatment.The virus spreads mainly through close contact between people, often through sputum generated by coughing, spraying or speaking.
Though breathing produces foam, foam usually falls to the ground or the surface of various objects and does not cause long-distance infection.
In addition, if someone touches the surface contaminated with the virus, then touches the mouth of their own eye and nose, it can also infect the virus.
Viruses can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
Although the pre- and post-recovery periods can also spread, the three days before the onset of the disease are most contagious. The standard diagnostic method is a real-time reverse polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test.
People suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations about the public wearing masks vary across the country, with some authorities opposed to wearing masks, and others required to wear masks.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine or special antiviral treatment scheme.
The vast majority of countries in all six WHO regions have local spread of the disease.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms and may also have suspicious flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, numbness and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or numbness, vague consciousness, difficulty waking up and bleaching of the face or lips; if these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
A few cases may be accompanied by symptoms of the upper respiratory tract, such as a spray, rhinitis or throat pain.
Different proportions of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, were also monitored.
Some cases in China initially showed only heartburn and heartbeat symptoms.
In some cases, viral pneumonia, multi-organ failure and even death can develop.
We call this the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually 5-6 days, but may vary to 2-14 days.
97.5% of infected people develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The report notes that not all infected people develop symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic infected persons in the spread of the outbreak is not fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that asymptomatic infected persons may promote the spread of the disease.
The proportion of non-symptomatic infections has not yet been determined, and research is still underway. The South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of confirmed cases showed no symptoms during hospitalization.
The National Health Council of China has listed non-symptomatic cases on a daily basis since April 1st, with 130 (78%) of the 166 people infected on that day not having symptoms at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can carry a lot of viruses.
Speaking loud splashes more foam than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that unobstructed coughing could cause sputum to spread to a maximum distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although such viruses do not generally spread through the air, the National Academy of Sciences has determined that they may be spread through a bio-aerosol that detects virus RNA-positive samples from an air collector in the outer corridors of the hospital.
Medical procedures such as interstitial and cardiopulmonary recovery (CPR) may cause the respiratory secretions to dim, thereby causing air to spread.
There is also concern that the virus may spread through the stool, but this risk is considered to be lower. The virus is most contagious when the patient has symptoms; although it may spread before the symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) said that while the spread of the new coronavirus is not fully clear, one person can infect 2-3 people. The virus survives on the surface of objects from hours to days.
Specifically, the known coronavirus can survive for a day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and for up to four hours on copper products with a purity of 99%.
However, its survival time is also influenced by humidity and temperature.
When used correctly, soap and detergents can also kill the virus.Sapeprodukts can break down the fatty protective layer of the virus, causing it to lose activity, while also removing the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzodiazepine and chlorophyllipt glucose (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. A study in Hong Kong, China, showed that saliva samples were collected on average two days after hospitalization.
The first sample of 5/6 patients had the highest viral load and the second day of 1/6 patients had the highest viral load.
Serious Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three patients with pneumonia in a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of this new type of SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the correlated coronavirus in nature.
The virus can be killed with home soap before it enters the human body, as soap can destroy the protective membrane of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most seriously affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells through vasoconvertase 2 (ACE2), which is the highest in type II pulmonary cells in the lungs.
The virus binds to ACE2 and enters the host cells by means of a special surface glucose protein called “sickle”.
Among the patients treated in the hospital in Wuhan, China, 12% of infected people found acute cardiomyopathic damage, with a higher proportion of patients with severe disease.
It is caused by inflammatory reactions throughout the body and disorders of the immune system, and cardiovascular symptoms are more common, but acute heart muscle damage may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in regulating heart function.
It is that the incidence of blood clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) in COVID-19 infected persons under ICU surveillance was higher and may be associated with poor prognosis. Coronary examinations of COVID-19 fatal patients found transmittal pulmonary damage (DAD) and intra-pulmonary lymphatic inflammation.
Although SARS-COV-2 is predisposed to the epidermal cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 may experience over-inflammatory reactions throughout the body.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretion of T cells in COVID-19 patients was associated with recruitment and severe lung pathology of inflammatory IL-6 secretive monocytes.
Body examinations also that lymphatic cells were immersed.
The WHO has published a number of disease screening programs.
The standard test method is the real-time reverse polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained through a nasopharyngeal wiper; however, a nasopharyngeal wiper or sputum sample can also be used.
In general, results can be obtained within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be done, but two blood samples are required at an interval of two weeks, and the results are hardly instantaneous.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop PCR testers to determine whether the virus is infected.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing — which can detect not only active infections, but also whether individuals have been infected with the virus in the past — is still under development, but has not been rolled out.
According to China’s experience, the accuracy of detection is only 60% to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. FDA approved the first instant diagnosis reagent and was put into use at the end of that month.The Diagnostic Guidelines issued by the University of Wuhan Southern Hospital propose methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Early infection is commonly seen in the double-pulmonary multi-leafed glass shade, with external peripheral asymmetry and rear tissue.
With the development of the virus, there may be manifestations under the chest, fragile path marks (the thickness of the small leaves is accompanied by different degrees of pulmonary filling) and pulmonary mutations.
There is very little information about COVID-19 micropathological damage and pathological physiology.
The main pathology finds as follows:
Eye examination: thorax, pancreatitis, pneumonia and pneumonia
There are four levels of severe viral pneumonia:
Light pneumonia: pneumonia, pulmonary cell growth, a large number of untypical lung cells, intermittent inflammation accompanied by lymphatic cell immersion and the formation of multi-nuclear giant cells.
Severe pneumonia: Transmittal pulmonary injury (DAD) accompanied by transmittal pulmonary fluid leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Recovery period pneumonia: fluidization and interpulmonary fibrosis from the pulmonary cavity
Blood: diffuse vascular blood clotting (DIC); youth white-youth red cell reaction
To reduce the risk of infection, preventive measures can be taken to stay at home; avoid entering crowded areas; wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; maintain good respiratory hygiene; and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends covering the mouth with a towel when coughing or spraying; if there is no towel, it is recommended to use the inner side of the elbow.
Hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or spraying.
The CDC recommends wearing a cloth mask in public places to prevent the spread of the virus to some extent in patients without symptoms. The core ofining a social distance strategy is to shut down schools and workplaces, restrict travel and cancel large public gatherings, thereby reducing the chance of infected persons coming into contact with large groups.
In addition, the social distance rule stipulates that at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) of distance should beined during interpersonal interactions.
Since vaccines are expected to be developed by at least 2021, efforts to reduce the peak of the outbreak are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19, which is known as the “Laping Epidemiological Curve.”
At the same time, the CDC recommends that people regularly wash their hands with soap and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially when there are obvious impurities after the toilet or on the hand, before meals, and after coughing, coughing or spraying.
It is also recommended to use alcohol-containing handwashes with at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap and drainage water nearby. For areas where water-free handwashes cannot be purchased, the WHO offers two recipes for local production.
These formulas stimulate antibacterial activity through ethanol or ethanol.
The use of hydrogen peroxide helps eliminate bacterial stains in alcohol; hydrogen peroxide is not a “hand disinfectant active substance.”
Add glycerin as a moisturizer.
Providing supportive care to people, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and other vital organ support.
The CDC recommends that suspected virus carriers wear simple masks.
Intra-organic membrane oxide (ECMO) has been used to relieve symptoms of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still to be studied.
It is recommended to maintain personal hygiene and advocate healthy lifestyle and eating habits, thereby boosting immunity.
Supporting therapy may be effective for patients with mild disease in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Council of China have issued an initiative calling for proper care for COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized.
U.S. critics and lung experts have compiled treatment recommendations from institutions and made them available free of charge through the IBCC.
As of April 2020, no special effects therapy for COVID-19 has been developed.
For certain symptoms, some medical experts recommend the first-line treatment with polio (for acetaminophen) instead of bromelain.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, and special attention should be paid to protection when performing operations that may produce aerosols in medical settings, such as injections or inhalations by hand.
For healthcare professionals who care for COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends that patients be transferred to an airborne infectious disease isolation room (AIIR) in addition to the adoption of standard preventive measures, exposure prevention and airborne prevention measures.
Recommended equipment: PPE protective clothing, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If possible, use a respirator (not a mask).
The N95 mask is authorized for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of the mask under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is mainly used to prevent the inhalation of suspended particles (such as dust), but when used for other purposes, it cannot guarantee the effective insulation of specific biological preparations.
If there is no mask, the CDC recommends the use of masks and, if necessary, a homemade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are mild and do not require the use of mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases require such measures.
Healthcare professionals are actively conducting research in the hope of providing respiratory support for COVID-19 patients who experience symptoms of respiratory failure. There is evidence that oxygen therapy or two-phase atmospheric pressure prevents the intersection.
It is unclear whether these two treatments are equally effective in severe patients.
If conditions allow, some doctors tend to use mechanical inhalation, as this technique also limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to nasal oxygen therapy. Severe cases are prevalent in older people (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
In many developed countries, the number of beds per capita is insufficient, and healthcare systems are unable to cope with the severe need for hospitalization due to the surge in COVID-19 cases.
A Chinese study found that 5% of patients would need to be sent to a serious care room, 2.3% of patients would need mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% of patients would die.
Approximately 30% of COVID-19 hospitalizations in China end up being sent to an ICU.
With the development of COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the complexity of mechanical ventilation increased further and the difficulty of oxygenation increased.
The use of respirators that support pressure control and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen transportation, while minimizing the risk of respirator causing lung and chest damage.
Old breathing machines may not high PEEP.
Since the study of potential therapies began in January 2020, several antiviral drugs have now entered the clinical trial phase.
Reddit appears to be one of the most potentially effective drugs at the moment.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several of the drugs being tested have either been approved for other uses or are in the advanced testing phase.
Severe patients may try to use antiviral drugs.
The WHO is calling on volunteers to participate in trials on potential therapy efficacy and safety.The FDA has temporarily authorized recovery-period plasma transfusions as an experimental treatment for patients with life-threatening severe diseases.
No necessary clinical studies have yet been conducted to demonstrate whether this therapy can safely and effectively treat the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to curb the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and ID number as requested.
The app is able to detect “near contact” by monitoring data, and then determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
Once potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a warning to local health officials. Combined use of mobile phone data big data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected persons and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track cellular data of suspected coronavirus carriers.
The measure is intended to force isolation and protect groups that may be exposed to infected citizens.
Similarly, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who violate the rules of isolation.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera noted that mobile phone operators’ data showed that “40% of citizens are still walking around.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hacking marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
President Kersti Kaljulaid called for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus worldwide.
Isolation, travel restrictions, side-effects treatment, or concerns about infection, all of these can be troublesome.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic downturn are the perfect storms that hurt people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease is mild, symptoms are rare and even manifest no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Light cases can usually recover within two weeks, while severe or severe cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, show that pregnant women have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 patients, but lack of COVID-19 data support.
In the most severely affected areas, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, hemorrhagic shock, or multi-organ dysfunction.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include hemorrhage, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had abnormalities in blood clotting, prolonged periods of coagulation, while 4% of the group had abnormalities in kidney function.
Approximately 20-30% of COVID-19 patients had elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time from onset to death was ten days, with an average hospital stay of five days.
However, the average time for patients transferred to the ICU to be hospitalized to die was seven days.
Early case studies found that the average time from the onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of 6 to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC) found that male mortality rate was 2.8 percent and female mortality rate was 1.7 percent.
The anatomical examination of the body's pulmonary sample tissue pathology showed that the two lungs had transmissible pulmonary injury accompanied by cellular fiber mucous secretions.
Lung cells observed viral cell pathologies.
Lung images are similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the deaths by the National Health Commission of China, 11.8% were caused by heart damage due to elevated calcium levels or sudden cardiac arrest.
According to data released in the United States in March, 89 percent of hospitalized patients have a history of illness.The supply of medical resources and regional socioeconomic conditions may also affect mortality.
Given regional differences and methodological difficulty, the estimates of disease mortality differ.
Underestimated cases of mild disease can lead to overestimated mortality.
However, if the case deaths are due to previous infections, it may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop a severe COVID-19 disease and about 2.4 times more likely to require severe care or die.
The Hong Kong Hospital Administration of China found that the pulmonary vitality of some rehabilitators decreased by 20% to 30%, and the lung scan display organs were damaged.
In addition, he may face severe post-care syndrome after rehabilitation.
As of March 2020, it is uncertain whether an existing infection will give rehabilitators effective long-term immunity.
Immunity may be determined by the behavioral characteristics of other coronaviruses, but it has been that some cases of COVID-19 were tested positive for coronavirus shortly after recovery.
These cases are thought to be continuous worsening infections rather than re-infection.
This virus is considered to be a natural virus, originating in animals, through infection spills.
The actual origin of the infection has not yet been determined, but as of December 2019, the infection was almost entirely interpersonal.
The first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 studies, published in January 2020, show that the earliest onset date was December 1, 2019.
The earliest outbreak date by the official publications of the WHO was December 8, 2019.
Several methods are used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region, change over time and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as detection levels, health system quality, treatment schemes, time of first outbreak, and age, gender and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths, and U07.2 to clinical or epidemiological-diagnosed COVID-19 infection but not laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, by April 17, 2020, the global disease mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Different measurements include case mortality (CFR) and infection mortality (IFR), the former reflecting the percentage of disease deaths to confirmed people, and the latter reflecting the percentage of disease deaths to infected people (including confirmed and undiagnosed people).
These statistics have no time limits and track the entire process of resolving a particular population from infection to case to case.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of infected.
The Italian epidemic center Castiglione d'Adda is a small town of only 4,600 inhabitants, with 80 people (1.7%) currently dying from the epidemic.
In Gangelt, the outbreak spread through various festivals and even affected young people, but mortality is relatively low, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified.
In addition, the German healthcare system is overwhelmed.
Blood donor assessments show that about 3% of Dutch citizens may have antibodies.
To date, 69 people (0,004 percent of the total population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
Epidemic effects and mortality vary by gender.
Chinese and Italian studies show that men have higher mortality rates than women.
Men aged 50 to 60 are at the highest risk of death, with the gender gap close to the age group of 90.
The male mortality rate in China was 2.8 percent and the female mortality rate was 1.7 percent.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unclear, but may be caused by genetic and behavioral factors.
Based on gender-based immunological differences, women have lower rates of smoking, and men have a lower age of complications (such as hypertension) than women, leading to higher male mortality rates than women.
In Europe, male infection accounts for 57 percent, with men accounting for up to 72 percent of the total number of deaths from COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women differently.
The proportion of female health workers (especially nurses) is higher and the risk of exposure to the virus is also higher.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease was officially named COVID-19.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, explained this: CO represents “corona”, VI represents “virus”, D represents “disease”, and 19 represents the time of the first outbreak (December 31, 2019).
The name was chosen to avoid referencing specific geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species or populations in order to comply with international naming recommendations to prevent mutilation. The virus that triggers COVID-19 is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO also uses the “COVID-19 virus” and “the virus that triggers COVID-19” in mass transmission.
Diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as “coronavirus.”
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease was commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases be used as temporary viral and disease names in line with the 2015 Guidelines on Places for Use in Disease and Virus Names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 will be released on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers have begun printing healthcare materials such as nose wipes and respirator parts.
For example, an Italian hospital has an urgent need for ventilation valves, a supplier cannot deliver parts on request, and a local start-up performs reverse engineering and prints the required 100 ventilation valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease spread rapidly through the network.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
No evidence of virus replication was found in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines for the treatment of this disease have yet been approved.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are actively engaged in international research and development of vaccines and drugs to treat COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a “solidarity trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that are currently most likely to be effective.
There are no vaccines yet, but agencies at all levels are actively working on candidate vaccines.
Since both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells through the ACE2 receptor, the results of previous work on SARS-CoV are needed.
Three vaccine strategies are being studied.
First, the researchers plan to develop a full-virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive viruses or dead viruses, is intended to stimulate the rapid immune response of the body when newly infected with COVID-19.
The second strategy is to develop a subunity vaccine that aims to develop a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to respond sensitively to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focused on assisted virus invasion of the ACE2 enzyme receptor S-tyronate.
The third strategy is to develop nucleic vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine development technology).
The safety and efficacy of the trial vaccines developed by the above strategies must be tested.On March 16, 2020, four Seattle volunteers launched the first clinical trial of the vaccine.
Vaccines contain harmless sequences of genes replicated from the virus that triggered the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been thought to be a major challenge in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials have been conducted.
Seven trials have been evaluated and approved for use in the treatment of malaria, including four trials on chlorophyll or chlorophyll.
Conversion to antiviral drug uses accounted for the vast majority of research in China, with nine phase III clinical trials on Redditsev conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and candidate drugs has begun. Currently, several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including Reddicev, Chlorophyllipt and Chlorophyllipt, Lopinav/Litonav and Lopinav/Litonav-combined interferon β.
As of March 2020, the therapeutic effectiveness of Redziwe has been preliminarily confirmed.
Observations have found a relief in clinical symptoms in patients treated with the sympathetic drug Redsiv.
Phase III clinical trials are currently underway in the United States, China and Italy.In February 2020, China launched a trial of chlorine, previously used to treat malaria, with preliminary results.
However, there has been a call for peer review of this study.
Health authorities in South Korea and China recommend the use of chlorine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking 1 gram per day, while warning that double doses are very dangerous and potentially fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency license for chlorophyllipt and chlorophyllipt, but doctors have the right to decide whether to use both of these drugs to treat patients with COVID-19. China's Seventh Edition of Guidelines also proposes the use of interferon, libavirin or salic acid abidol to treat COVID-19.
Preliminary data show that high doses of libavirin have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in the body.
After confirming the low-concentration inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2, further intramuscular studies are recommended using nitrogenates. Studies have shown that the primary thyroprotein induced by TMPRSS2 is a necessary condition for the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptors into the human body.
Regardless of whether or not it is used in conjunction with acetaminophen, there are serious limitations in the study of chlorophyllipt and acetaminophen, unless further research is carried out, and the medical community may not accept these therapies. Ostravin has no inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 in the outer body and has not been found to have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
Cell factor storms can become a complication of the later treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that chlorophyllipt may have anti-cell factor storm properties. After completing a small study, the National Health Council of China included chlorophyllipt in the treatment guidelines.
Following a positive test for patients with severe illness, Italy is conducting a national non-random trial of Phase 2.
Combined with serum iron protein blood tests to identify cell factor storms aimed at curbing the development of the disease, while cell factor storms are thought to cause deaths in some of the infected.
In 2017, with the support of reviewed case studies, the FDA approved the use of leucocyte 6 receptor antagonists in the treatment of steroid-induced cell-factor-release syndrome caused by other causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no randomized, controlled evidence to show that antipsychotics are effective in treating CRS.
Current research is underway to extract purified enriched antibodies from the immune system of COVID-19 rehabilitators to be injected into people who need antibodies as a passive immunotherapy before the vaccine is developed successfully.
This strategy has been tried during the SARS outbreak, but its effectiveness has not yet been determined.
Virus neutralization is an expected mechanism of action for passive antibody therapy to mediate SARS-CoV-2 immune defense.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell toxicity and/or digestive action can the same effect.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are currently being developed, such as the use of artificial monoclonal antibodies.
The amount of serum production during rehabilitation may increase, which is conducive to rapid deployment. Serum consists of the liquid portion of the blood of the rehabilitating patient, which contains specific antibodies against this virus.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Wuhan City Center Hospital doctor Li Wenping raised awareness of the spread of the new coronavirus, but then unfortunately contracted COVID-19 and died.
