I hope to return on October 20.
Tom was dating Mary.
This dictionary is useless.
Get yourself dressed.
Can you do that for us?
You two should go.
She can speak Japanese.
I'm not your maid.
They went on the boat.
A man is caught by the tongue.
There's nothing you can do to help.
The Kabyle language is rich!
Tom is outside, isn't he?
Get out of trouble, you're in trouble!
I don't know where Tom is staying.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.
Have you read?
Tom's family begged him to stay.
I like to travel.
I know who left early.
Where don't you want to go?
Modern Hebrew is easier than Old Hebrew.
Get your feet out of here!
It is becoming increasingly clear that we do not live in the same world.
These are birds.
I thought he would come.
Follow your dreams.
Tom is close.
Are you girls?
Someone is trying to scare you.
Someone ripped two pages out of this book.
They didn't tell me.
Did you come back from Tibet?
Tom is cooking dinner.
I should have fooled you!
He is sleeping.
Give me some time.
I forgot his name.
Tom is going to Australia on Monday.
Can you stop yelling?
The kingdom is inhabited by the Sultan, and the poor build it for him.
He came out of the river.
I need a car of choice.
You need to eat now.
Thank you for always being there for me.
How many books have you read?
Are you serious?
The fire is burning.
You can't leave me like this.
No one died.
Something is missing.
Thank you for inviting me here.
Do you think of anyone?
Who is the one who is angry?
Is she going?
You are always wrong.
I drank a cup of coffee.
Are you writing a letter?
I cut my hair every month.
Tom needs me.
Let the dogs roam.
You can now consider Layla your daughter.
It's too much!
How many times?
Who else uses Tatoeba in your office?
Tom reached out to help Mary.
I'm tired of your complaining.
Tom changed places.
Tom and I just went to the party.
I hope no one saw you do this.
I want to visit Boston in the spring.
Make me a sandwich.
What do you like better, meat or fish?
Someone may want it.
Who is the angry one?
Shouldn't I be working tomorrow?
When did you get back from Boston?
Are you okay?
Now that I'm older, I think about other things.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
I don't know what else to say.
Be careful!
I don't want to grow old.
I won't accept your mistakes again.
Pour it out.
How many books do you have?
You should learn from your mistakes.
Bring her home.
Do you watch TV every day?
How do you like your coffee?
You have a toothbrush in your teeth.
I haven't seen him since.
We are not being rude.
I hope to return on October 20.
Rajum is already here.
I wonder where she is.
Tom never returned his money.
I often walk.
Tell me something about him.
Please don't die.
Tom pretended not to hear what Mary said about him.
I think we can help.
My dear...
Get out of here!
Tom stayed.
Someone stole it from me.
Did Tom really say that he thought about staying in Australia?
If I were you, I'd go home and get some rest.
Some of what you say is disturbing.
Tom and I went to the party together.
Do you believe those stories?
He will stay calm.
Did your religion come in peace?
Aren't you hungry?
Look at you.
Is there anyone here who can help me?
Tom can't save Mary.
Tom lives with his mother in Australia.
There is a God.
You obviously lost them.
Tom is lying.
Who will take his place?
You're better than Tom.
I have my own business.
Tom and Mary are helping each other.
Give Tom a break!
Someone tried to kill you.
They all agreed.
I already told you that I didn't do it.
I was overcome with a fear I couldn't bear.
Are you Catholic?
Don't worry about it.
Champagne is good.
Where are those children?
The world is a small village.
Is there anything else?
You should ask someone else.
I hope no one saw us.
Plants are growing.
Sami is playing Farid's guitar.
When are you going?
I hope no one saw you like this.
I want to know more about your country.
I hate French.
Tom was fired from his job in October.
I wish no one had seen you.
Stop contacting me.
Tom responded sharply.
Tom will be late again today.
The congregation has ten members.
Do you think Tom loves me?
Good night mother.
Do you like carrots?
Do you want to stay longer?
Have you ever milked a cow?
Tom took the last place.
Here he is drinking a glass of wine.
Tom loves you.
I speak ancient Greek.
Tom didn't tell the truth about where he was that day.
Tom is missing.
Hello, my dear.
There will be no reading on October 20.
Are you lying to me?
You expect a lot from him.
You are getting fat.
You are part of the problem.
Stop your nonsense!
Sami was beating up on Farid.
Tom didn't answer because he didn't know what to say.
Are you a pain?
I hear something.
What is wrong with you?
Any problem is better than no problem.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
Play me a Chopin.
He spoke slowly.
I hope Tom is strong.
Stop worrying.
Do you know him?
Are you shy?
Dan bought a new computer.
Is there anyone?
Tom doesn't know how to type.
My last month is October.
I was in the mountains.
Stephen is dead.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
Have you considered them?
Please tell me your real name.
I hope no one followed you.
Is there anyone?
I hope no one followed you.
Tom was going with Mary.
Let's go and tell the others.
Is this wine?
Please stay here.
Nothing I did was permanent.
Have you seen Tom yet?
He will be fine.
Follow the trail.
Have a book and a game.
Tom knows that I'm not afraid of anyone.
She's reading it.
Did someone call you?
I didn't think it counted.
He took her home.
Everyone hates Tom.
Tom and Mary met at the station.
You've obviously lost them all.
Can I count on you?
Get in the house!
I want you to go to your room and pack your things.
Let's play something.
It's all right.
Stop worrying.
You are our prisoner.
They stopped him for that.
Welcome to the house.
Wait here already.
Are you working tonight?
Stay with me for a while.
Please let me pay.
Tom refuses to dive.
I know that Tom is Canadian.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
Tom will be thirty in October.
Jim is like his father.
I need you here.
I think there's someone in the front room.
Are you smiling?
Have you gone mad?
Tom will tell Mary.
Do you write French?
Tom stopped kissing his wife.
No one knows.
Breathe out!
None of Tom's advice is very helpful.
You still have life ahead of you.
They all ran away.
We toured the country by car.
I am Chinese.
Did Tom say anything about his accident?
Tom turned his head toward Mary.
Are you ill?
I wish no one had seen you come here.
Tom only slept for a few hours.
We will all sing.
Sami was talking to his mother.
I let Tom kiss me.
Sami found a hole in the floor.
Wait for him.
Tom said he wanted to get a cold.
Tom is waiting.
Someone is watching us.
I want to show you some translated texts for editing.
Stop the conversation.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
It is a secret.
Construction began in October.
I brought you something to eat.
Get out of here!
I was a little surprised to see Tom there.
Choose carefully.
Listen to this!
They built it.
You must never forget that.
I can't see her.
They're not.
Tom thought Mary might have been fooled.
Tom doesn't seem to care about Mary.
Tell me who will help us too.
Tom stopped doing business.
You should stay away from them.
Aren't you close to Tom's aunt?
Sometimes, just by nodding your head, you can tell you've been listening properly.
Tom attended the party yesterday.
Ayako, lower your voice a little.
How deep is it?
You are welcome!
I was in his room.
You are all crazy.
I haven't been in Boston since October.
Someone forgot his umbrella.
Tom doesn't know how to speak in public.
They are all happy.
He went out on a limb.
Thank you for your listening.
Can you fix this one?
Please be careful! The doors will close now!
Someone has to stop you.
Don't be discouraged when you miss a date.
Emar was just annoyed.
Tom is poor.
Laughter is no more when the teeth are dry.
You smell.
The last date for the round will be October 20.
You swim better than I do.
Tom said he could speak French.
I'll do everything I can for you.
Swimming is good for your health.
I am a witch.
Tom didn't call Mary.
Wash your clothes.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
I was on the road last summer.
Why isn't anyone speaking?
Eat something!
Have you seen a movie?
I should probably go now.
Tom threw Mary's sunglasses out the window.
Can I talk to you in private?
Who is ready to ask?
I want to call my lawyer.
I'm very disappointed in Tom.
We are starving here.
Sami will cry like a baby.
Tom and I love each other.
The one I thought was my friend betrayed me.
We didn't ask Tom to help.
Your eyes are twinkling.
Let me out!
How does that look to you?
Sami was reading a book.
I took a pension.
She called him.
Hey, you!
Hit him! Hit him!
Tom was three feet taller than Mary.
Don't restrict yourself to food if you don't want to eat.
Tom was angry with Mary.
Someone stole my money.
Here, have a little more.
Tom doesn't look happy.
The computer is new.
Say it properly.
Mayan patients need to be Mayan people.
Tom never asked me.
Are you sick?
When are we going to do it?
Tom needs to buy a ticket for Mary, too.
You are stupid.
Is there anyone here?
Can I go home now?
She is a woman, not a girl.
Sami told me that you were in a conversation.
You will be hungry.
I continued working.
Ask them.
Someone is coming behind us.
I moved here last October.
Will you come with me?
Tom wants to work.
Tom became friends with Mary while he was living in Boston.
You have no idea.
Tom is much younger than me.
Finally, I visited Boston last October.
We are proud of Tom!
Please let me out.
Tom is not a Pokémon.
Someone called for you.
Hurry up!
This is the truth.
I've forgotten all about you.
I love you very much.
I know these people.
Everything is fine on your side.
I want to walk with you.
Have you read this one before?
Tom doesn't think I would do that.
Tom and I went together.
Are you all right?
Take this one.
I'm not your friend.
I hate coffee.
She teaches English.
Do you think anyone can see me?
Leave him to us.
He sent me a message.
Get to know yourself!
It makes no sense at all.
Ask someone.
I won't let you pay.
I need to sit alone to think.
Walk with such caution.
Does Tom believe that?
These are the ones you eat.
Someone is looking at you.
He is a genius.
Tom didn't expect to be here on October 20th.
You are all crazy.
Are you worried about something?
Tom ate a bowl of spaghetti.
Is Tom still crying?
I don't think that is true.
Get over here!
Jeff is a tax collector.
They missed the train.
They died.
He danced.
This is my opinion, not yours.
They have weapons.
A little silence, please!
Tom is an anorexic.
The frosts start falling in October.
Get out of here!
Tom was angry at Mary.
Go and change your clothes.
The mountain turned it into a rock!
Someone else has already done it.
Tom can't help.
Good luck with your new job.
He hates Algerian culture.
Go to the house.
What's the problem?
He is gone.
Is there anyone there?
Can you find her?
You could be a writer.
I saw you in my dreams.
Try it.
Do not make mistakes.
Answer them.
Tom seems happy.
I learned that from you!
I still love Tom.
Get up !
I don't know how to answer your question.
I'm afraid Tom won't tell Mary anything.
He is skilled.
Think again.
In friendship is strength.
Please do as I say.
You are part of the problem.
Are you crazy?
Whose is it?
You drank a cup of coffee.
Can you see?
How long have you been reading?
When did you first go to Australia?
Tom is angry at Ken.
Tom carefully removed the knife.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
You stayed home.
One question.
Tom smiled.
I remember.
Tom likes to see Mary dance.
I was lost.
Someone is watching Tom.
I eat bread.
They answered.
My throat hurts.
He was tired, but he had work to do.
You're through with the war.
He just answers the phone.
"The apple is ripe for the crop". is like "The corn is ripe for the harvest", says a friend.
She died.
He built it.
Come on now.
Have you read?
Call me tomorrow.
It is snowing.
You'll see Tom soon.
Send this letter by plane.
You'll find Tom is agreeable.
Someone is coming.
Cars are expensive.
They are all happy.
The first tool of a people's intelligence is its language.
Let me go!
Just look at my new car.
Read to us.
Where did you find him?
Tom was sitting under a tree.
You can use my computer if you want.
Do not touch.
Hold on to Tom.
No one understands.
Please help me with my work.
You shouldn't be here.
Kabyles love their language.
I have no choice.
Where are you?
Tom has a new suit.
You're going to steal Tom's money.
They all paid attention.
She swims well.
She likes to study.
Tom seems scared.
I'll tell Tom that you said that.
He gave us everything we wanted.
Tom hates Mary.
What will you do if it rains?
Our teacher hates to be questioned by his students while he is teaching.
Just look at my new car.
The rich man!
No one knows.
Tom does everything by himself.
The wood burns easily.
Have you returned from Tibet?
Follow your foot.
Stop dreaming about it.
Did you have dinner or not?
She is not a whore.
Tom seems happy.
She loves you very much.
Your writing is very good.
We hope you will come often with us.
I met Tom in October.
Are you Chinese?
Go and get dressed!
Are you at home?
I met her only once.
His phone, please.
Did you hear what they said?
The Kabalean hat is beautiful.
Tom was in love with Mary in high school.
Is there anyone here?
Just let me in.
Eat the plants - Millions of them.
Stop the noise!
What are Tom and Mary worried about?
Save her .
I want to kiss Tom.
Tom and Mary are going to the Netherlands.
Have you seen the new movie?
I found your jacket.
He was enchanted by her beauty.
I play Chopin.
You look like you're fine.
He was born rich.
Please pass me some honey and black pepper.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
You should try to meet Tom.
I know Tom is stupid.
Tom needs about a dozen eggs.
I was told that Tom is still in Australia.
I'm going to eat at a Chinese restaurant this afternoon.
Tom speaks French.
Tom is not talking.
Now that I'm a teacher, I think differently.
Mary likes to buy clothes.
I don't know who killed him.
Sami is six years old.
Stop it, you idiot!
You should tell Tom the truth.
Tom killed someone today.
I want you back today.
Get out of here!
Get him!
Did anyone mention my name?
You look like a European.
Someone came to our house.
I want you to tell me the truth.
No, thank you. I'm tired.
Let me explain.
This boy is good.
What a fool!
Jeff is stealing jewelry.
Ask one of the boys you see first.
When was the last time you were busy?
Someone is calling.
Wanting to be lucky, Tom went to the playroom and knocked over some bricks.
This is a fire.
My wife thought I was crazy.
He just talks, not thinks.
I can't wait to be at your Halloween party.
Please help me!
I know this is a long visit.
I got cold.
Please repeat.
I don't know what you like.
French is not only spoken in France.
Stay where you are.
Take this table.
She is shocked.
Go and warm yourselves.
You're new here, aren't you?
He is a small dog.
What kind of food do you eat?
I could be stopped by anyone.
Close your eyes and close them tightly.
Look again.
Tom or someone else said that.
Take a rest.
Tom seems ready to me.
What a move!
I didn't know you had a brother.
Speak up!
Wash up!
No one can do it for Tom.
Get down!
Where does Tom live?
You're going to bite me!
Have you read this book yet?
Tom almost killed Mary with a hammer.
We are at the end of the journey.
You're not tired, are you?
Tom won the Nobel Prize in physics.
Tom didn't help Mary.
Is that French?
Open the door.
I didn't read it well.
Tom didn't want to get married.
You admit it.
Is he dead?
You are our prisoner.
The meat is good for you.
You saw Tom do that, didn't you?
Tom didn't raise his head.
Neither of my parents can speak French.
There is no shortage.
Today is the 20th of October.
My younger brother was raised by my grandmother.
I know.
You are really smart!
I'll eat it if you eat it too.
Stop shouting.
It is worth it.
Is that true?
Tom was forced to resign from his job.
Someone just called.
Tom dressed up as a girl for Halloween.
Someone broke into Tom's house last night.
What is your philosophy?
Was I wrong about that?
I won this one.
Where do you live now?
Sami seems to have lost his mind.
Welcome to the house.
I'm looking forward to writing with you.
Truth is more important than anything.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Someone is following me.
We picked up the bags and went straight to the market.
Are you safe?
Tom got there before Mary.
Sami went back to work.
Do not move.
Are you at home too?
It's like she lives by the lake.
Tom came alone, without Mary.
Keep writing.
Try to find a cure.
You'd better cut your hair.
Yes, please.
I'm not good at swimming.
Kiss, you're going to.
Is Jesus really the son of God?
Say something.
When did you come to Boston?
From now on we will only speak French.
Sami feels as if he knows Layla.
I just got out of the bar at the Ukfadu.
This is my favorite kind of food.
I hope no one saw you come here.
Is this for nothing?
You have turned me away.
Our food is all rotten.
Do good to those who hate you.
No matter how fast you hurry through the park, you won't make it in time.
Show me exactly where he lives.
To learn a language, you must know the vocabulary.
They all died.
I hate to work.
Be careful.
Do you know how far Boston is from Chicago?
As soon as I was old enough, my nephew passed me by.
Can you fix this?
Tom wasn't here last week.
Where is your aunt?
I believed everything we were told.
She never laughed.
Let them help you.
We heard the door open.
Are you angry?
Are you sad?
There's someone out there.
Sami and Layla are smashing the back of a three-dollar ticket.
They want something to write about.
We bought these books.
Who are your parents?
Add another pot.
Tom is a man of secrets.
What should we say?
How many Pawns have you got?
French is difficult.
He is slow in his steps.
I think they're going to watch me.
They smoke.
People are very happy in Australia.
How strong you are!
Tom likes to do things.
You are a problem.
You are a beauty here.
I am always proud of you.
I think you've been tricked.
Hello! How are you?
Tom is used to crying a lot.
Tom said he never had a peach.
Are you busy right now?
Where did you buy your clothes?
Be strong!
You should always have a dictionary in your hands.
Put your clothes on!
I hope you understand.
We left early.
You are our prisoners.
Tom has more money to buy Mary what she wants.
Tom agreed.
Tom is in a hurry.
Come on in here!
Sami's car was very nice.
Stop singing.
Love is alive.
Close your eyes.
Is there anyone you want to see?
How can I explain it?
Tom left on October 20.
Are you full?
How much?
I want to have someone to talk to.
I don't want to watch TV this afternoon.
Tom and Mary help each other.
Sami was wearing a helmet.
I feel brave enough to do that.
Tom and Mary got married in October 2013.
Stay with me a while.
Go swim in cold water.
20 October 2013 is Arim.
Tom finally did.
Put them on.
You look like a European.
This river reminds me of Italy.
It's the third of October.
He is a wretch.
Snow is white, and snow is black.
Nobody cares who you are.
Your writing is terrifying.
I was very lucky.
Someone stole it from me.
I'll wake you up tomorrow morning.
Who was the world's first football player?
Nothing is as hard as the truth.
To your health!
You obviously eat a lot.
Smoking is a national habit.
Does anyone in your group speak French?
Are you going to study today?
Our turn has come!
We eat meat.
Tom drinks twice as much as Mary.
I want to know who they called.
Do you want anything else?
Just talk to them.
You can milk cows.
Get out of the way!
Just put them together.
You are drunk.
My life is in your hands.
I'm looking forward to one.
I hope no one sees you like this.
The fireworks!
Tom will always remember Mary.
Tom doesn't know Mary.
Tom walked.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
What theory do you have about what happened?
I'm doing my clothes.
I was getting tired of the drills.
To be honest, I don't like chicken.
Her father has never been abroad.
How many books have you read?
You sound like your mother.
I laughed at Tom.
Are you Ukrainians?
It is worthless.
It's best if you start now.
What is the tallest tower in Boston?
I learned.
When will you eat?
I'm listening to music.
I'll call you this afternoon.
Someone started the fire.
I'm glad I didn't know.
Someone drove Tom home last night.
Tom didn't raise his head.
I'm not tired today.
Do you like Tom's girlfriend?
Tom said he didn't want Mary to win.
Try to convince Tom to leave early about this.
Keep the oil away from the fire.
Everything is going to change.
Tom fought Mary in front of everyone.
Have another.
If you need me, call.
They're not helping.
Please don't break my head.
Can you fix this?
Tom is drowning.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
I think Tom is drunk.
He leaned so hard on her, she broke.
We got married on October 20th.
I'm sure they were wrong.
I want to eat shrimp.
Tom mustn't know where Mary lives.
Do you like science fiction movies?
They speak French.
It's better if you tell the truth.
Close the window!
They eat these things.
Tom is the best-known.
It was a mistake!
Are you making fun of me like that?
No one knows what the future holds.
Someone has to do it.
Tom gave the teacher an apple.
Are you ill?
Tom seems strong.
Everyone is happy that Tom was arrested.
Have you learned to cook or something?
The color of the rose is pink.
I wonder where they are.
I understand
I wish I was in such good health to do that.
Tom doesn't live in Australia.
You are at home.
Run fast, or you'll miss the train.
I met a man who knew Tom.
Look closely.
I like pop music.
No one said that.
Get all of you involved.
This guy is a poet.
Do you take the train to school?
Why do people lie?
One day I'll buy the same machine that my grandfather used to make.
Do you think we'll win?
Look again.
There was no guard inside.
I wish him good night.
Tom will stay here.
I think his opinion is important.
Just look at my new car.
Stop the car!
This table is taken.
Water, please.
This will make you stronger.
Sami is quick to respond on Facebook.
Someone broke this plate.
She hasn't studied music.
I don't know where he is.
I got caught in the rain.
I know.
What kind of paper do you want?
You are dreaming.
Does Tom work in Australia?
Get ready.
I can't write this correctly.
Your father has a limp.
Tom sat in the bed next to Mary.
Phrases like "Muslims love Jesus and Moses,... or vice versa" are clearly a clear line between the dismissal of their biases and the rejection of the Orthodox and evangelical biases. It was only when I saw their TRUMP shifting between shirts and shorts that I realized: that's why they agree, in our "life", on the basis of the principle of peace. The Jews merely added the USCEEKM's support for the rejection of the dictatorship and those of Iran's rejection of the bishop and the traditional ruler of Kamasutra.
Where is your grandmother?
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
Are you Anna?
Please find him.
Stay here and wait until Tom comes.
Have you seen your table?
Are you Hungarian?
Look, that child is about to drown.
My kitchen is here.
We're building a desk here.
Someone has already sent me.
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom is running.
Tom came to visit Mary.
Who spoke?
I have no money left in my purse.
The animals were frightened by the noise.
Tom is honest.
You are blinded by love.
Everybody knows it.
Please help me open this door.
Can you be my door?
Take your hands off me.
You expect too much of him.
I probably shouldn't have asked Tom that question.
Stop the car.
They built.
Are you waiting for someone?
This girl is a witch.
Stop fighting.
Get in the house!
Hurry up.
This happened on October 20th.
How much do you owe?
You are a great writer.
I love my brothers and sisters.
Don't use this train near water.
I hope she always has fun like this.
It's very hard to find out what this is.
Stay with us.
Tom left them.
I hope it will always be like this.
Get your feet out of here!
I want you to read this letter.
You are welcome.
Tom is stunned.
You heard him, didn't you?
You are dead.
I know that Tom is a student.
We bought a bottle of water.
In your pocket!
Someone has to do something.
Leave it all behind.
I can teach you how to read.
He is one of my father's students.
I'm very hungry.
You should apologize.
Sami had a bad day.
Sami noticed that Layla's voice changed instantly.
Do you eat well?
Did you call me?
We are lucky.
Tom is going to put everything in order.
We forgot about it.
Tom is going to Nice tomorrow.
Mary bought her children a Halloween costume.
How long will you be staying in Boston?
Why does the Koran say that non-Muslims should die?
You are the love of my life.
I hate him too.
Tom sat next to his daughter.
Take all that is.
Did you know? These are the names of the farms in the village of Ysergen.
They all cried.
I don't want to live with you.
It seemed to me that Tom was paying attention to me.
Please bring us two cups of coffee.
They sent me a message.

Tom and I think the same.
What do they want from them?

Are you there?
You will find a picture of his car missing in his room.

Take these.
Tom has chosen.
Tom seems small.
My dog has a long tail.
Tom seemed a little upset when I saw him yesterday.
I went out with a girl in high school who speaks French.
You are Americans.
The policeman was staring at Tom.
This one, you.
You are the apple of my eye.
Let the animals out of their cages.
I'll buy it for you.
You have apologized.
I know Tom doesn't want to get involved in anything.
You have me stunned!
She went to Boston.
Someone is watching us.
He didn't say no, he didn't want to.
Tom doesn't know that I'm hungry.
Tom will be third on October 20th.
I like to play music.
I don't think that.
Welcome to the house.
You are a puppy.
Who invited you to the party?
Where did you forget your umbrella?
What did you say about his new novel?
What a handsome young man!
I don't think I should speak like a native speaker. I just want to be able to talk to a native speaker.
Yes, two.
You should read this.
I wish no one would see me like that.
I am looking into the darkness.
I can teach you how to sing.
My father is used to walking.
Tom hates Mary.
I'm not your maid!
How does a fool like you eat all this?
Have you become a fool?
Thank you for your listening.
Just look at my new car.
Where am I?
They are builders.
What kind of paper do you want?
That's where you're wrong.
October is still three months from now.
I wish it would always be like this.
You're more than that.
Tom is getting hungry.
Stay a while.
You are obviously wrong.
Many houses are on fire.
Why don't they say anything?
Tom stayed with someone.
I'm afraid we didn't get there early.
My mother's father is my maternal grandfather.
No one knows.
You are always together.
There's nothing there.
Keep running!
I hope you learned from some of your mistakes.
You should write a novel.
Someone called you.
I like to sleep at night.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
Do you play sports?
You are here.
Nothing is off your word.
Are you rich?
Do not forget us!
Are you finished?
We're finished.
Above all, be honest with the elderly.
This is your slave, isn't it?
I hate to lose.
Someone has to go first.
Sami crashed in Layla's car.
I hope you will listen to me.
You are welcome.
They have Facebook.
I bought it.
They need nothing.
Have something.
Tom is pissed.
I'm burning up my batteries.
Tom never gave a hat to anyone.
Everyone is talking.
Tom knows that you're lying.
What else?
Have you spoken to them or not?
What can I say!
I'll get a lottery in October.
You are smelly.
In your health!
Tom doesn't know that I'm here.
"The end is not yet", said Titus Livus.
You are all so stupid.
You were praying.
It is obvious!
I know you're right.
I'll call you before I go.
I can't go swimming with you today.
She drank too much water.
Close your book.
When someone calls you, don't bother them.
Why are you crying?
She is reading.
Tom likes Mary.
He is used to getting up early.
Her hair has grown.
Look at her.
Tom murdered Mary.
You know the way.
What's wrong with me going to Boston myself?
Write in Spanish.
You should ask someone else.
He wasn't a jerk.
It is too heavy for us to lift.
Please, don't be such a fool.
The flowers are beautiful!
How can you not know?
Kabyle culture has always lived in peace even during the Turkish occupation of North Africa.
It seems like we should do that.
Listen up, you children!
Stop the car.
They have a problem.
Wash the apple before eating it.
Tom said he should learn French.
Tom is swimming.
They must be asleep.
Good news awaits us at home.
Shut your mouth!
I let out something and it burned.
Stop it!
I want to show you some translated texts for editing.
I don't know him.
Tell him I love you.
Did you hear what they said?
I hope no one saw you.
Mine is better than yours.
I said what I kept in my heart.
I like lime juice.
Shut it down!
I flew to Boston on October 20.
I'll buy it for you.
Tom was robbed.
Keep running!
Somebody will do it.
Go and get cleaned up.
This cycle is reduced by three seconds a day.
Tom is sick.
Make it small.
How are you?
Are you thinking about me?
His eyes are red.
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't do that.
Are you free?
Tom is grown.
I left my keys in the car!
Wait outside.
Do you like my friend?
No one is listening.
My knee hurts.
Why doesn't Tom want you here?
The police believe that Tom was stabbed before he cut his hair.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is thinking.
No one remembers.
What is your father's profession?
Faith is not a personal belief. It is a feeling that people feel.
I won't let you go.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
These pictures are beautiful.
Can you speak French?
Tom hopes to be in Boston by the end of October.
What are you doing?
Help me out here.
Tom forgot Mary's phone number.
Am I making you happy or not?
I speak French better than Tom.
Sami followed me on Snapchat.
I saw someone greet Tom.
Tom sent me.
She is one of the greatest scientists in Japan.
You lied.
Are you cold?
Don't leave the campsite unattended.
Tom is the son of a famous teacher in Boston.
Can we say no?
I bought some new bread.
It's not the people who are fat who are fat.
Why this failure?
You are our prisoners.
Are you busy right now?
Forget about it.
We're not feeling well right now.
Where did you get this idea of your story?
Do you want me to call him?
I want you to stay in Australia until Christmas.
I hope to see you in October.
I didn't think Tom needed our help.
Tom doesn't know that I know.
He looks good.
Your father has a fever.
Tom was the last person to see Mary alive.
Tom lay down on the table.
Let her go.
That's right.
How I missed you!
Tom knocked on the door again.
Are you guys gay?
Tom is unlikely to change.
Tom advised someone to get him drunk and eat.
He likes to read books.
He went to see her when she was living in London.
Someone has gone.
The cat is back.
How are things in Australia?
Tom likes to talk about art.
I need you to do one thing.
Sami never talked about Layla.
Let me look at what you wrote.
Tom saw it, too.
Keep it warm.
Tom is not married.
He was looking for his pen.
They understand.
The exams will be held after October 20.
I'm expecting a baby.
I can't see well.
Just shut up.
Hello, how are you?
I don't have any money in my pocket.
The celestial bodies are a great gift to mankind.
They all left.
You have deceived me.
I hope no one saw you come here.
I'm sorry no one saw you come here.
Why don't we let you do that?
I have only one question.
We don't use a gun until it's necessary.
I hope to play guitar.
Hold your breath!
Come with me.
Both Tom and Mary don't know how to speak French.
Tom gave Mary a kiss.
Read it.
Say hi to him.
How I miss you!
Someone will pay.
I like to watch westerns.
Tom hates Mary.
Please be quiet.
They are sweet.
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
She is forbidden.
I don't have many friends in Boston.
We have nothing to eat.
Are you ready to go?
Sami entered the store.
Smile at her, please!
I want to travel abroad.
Where do you live now?
Tom said he could come back on October 20.
Move carefully.
Call him if you have any questions.
I'll go now if I can.
We hate all of you.
She can go.
What paper do you need?
Follow Tom!
I wish no one had seen you come here.
Is your father having dinner with you this afternoon?
I left Australia on the twentieth of October.
She loves him.
I'm going to go out and get something to eat.
It is difficult.
The mouse signal showed me that Tom was walking well.
He is lending his apartment to his father.
We must establish laws against bullying in the workplace, or in housing, education and the military. This is what our constitution and documents demand.
When will you come to see me?
The coronavirus is transmitted by a viral virus.
Just tell her the straight up.
This is easy.
I'll go with you.
Have you lost your minds?
Tom was passing in front of Mary.
Just do what I did!
You are wrong.
Tom built a house that big.
Someone stole my money.
Your writing is terrifying.
I lied when I said I didn't like Tom.
No one has been up.
I start work on the first of July.
There is much we can do to help these families.
I do not understand anything.
Tom is going to marry Mary.
Tom pulled out a car.
Mary's sentences are easy to translate.
They're teasing you.
You speak my language.
I'm happy here.
When Tom and I went to Boston, we visited Mary.
Read this book when you have time.
I'll see him tomorrow.
Be sure to answer me verbally early.
Tom is lucky.
What can I say!
Tom asked Mary.
It's a long way.
Try to impress him.
Are you ready?
Someone was watching us.
You remind me of someone.
Pack your bags.
We want to get to know you.
Do they all like music?
I was drunk.
Let the animals out of their cages.
Hurry up and get your clothes on.
So what do you want?
He got up.
Tom and I disrespected Mary.
It is good!
They all sat.
Wait a second!
Is she not well?
I know your number.
Hello, what's your name?
Tom and Mary knew they had to do that.
The police are looking for me.
We are so excited!
Are you a foreigner?
There was a lot of people waiting.
Tom said goodbye to Mary.
Go on with your dreams.
I'll show you how it's done.
Say goodbye to your friends.
Probably not.
Tom is drowned.
Tom got the news that Mary was following him.
It was a rush.
She came after Tom.
Read this book.
Tom said he didn't intend to shoot.
They are still after us.
What time will you be home?
Is anyone hurt?
I hope no one saw you come here.
Tom is upset.
This party is not yours.
You're like the guy who built a house with bricks and rubble.
Everybody knows.
No one wants to be late.
I brought you some food.
Tom made us sing.
Would you let us go now?
The river is very crowded.
Read this book.
I can't take it off.
I like it very much.
I heard what happened.
Sami and Layla have not lived together for six years.
Have you become a liar?
She hates Algerian culture.
I follow a regime.
This is my phone.
I can stay in Boston until October.
Do you care what people think of us?
Muhend Belqasem does a live broadcast on Facebook every Thursday.
Sami is a villain.
If you want to go, go now!
We've been looking for you everywhere.
I think it's a beautiful place.
Tom said he only spoke to you.
You are part of the problem.
Have we met before?
She speaks ten languages.
If you eat it, you will die.
It's a race against time.
That's what we have.
I think I understand.
It's a little hot today.
Is that Tom's sister?
Tom is burned.
Tom thinks about Mary all the time.
Tom didn't talk about you.
Sweet dreams!
Tom said he's never driven a truck.
Did anyone see anything?
I know that Tom is a billionaire.
She is a whore.
This will warm you.
I hope it is a dream.
You are blinded by love.
You have burned me!
Who is complaining?
Are you Julius?
Do you have any other questions?
Tom isn't like that.
You will find someone.
Stop shouting.
It is Kabyle.
He didn't dare look at it.
Are you people?
All my problems are over.
I hope no one saw you come here.
Alice smiled at me.
To be honest, I'm not a husband and wife.
Please lock the door.
Enjoy your life!
I don't want to go alone.
The stone said to the grass: "I will die". He replied: "What shall I say?"
God will give you as many as you need: one will pass the other.
Someone has to do it.
My son has become a man.
Do you mind if I ask a simple question?
Here you go.
Tom knows.
Have you read?
I lost.
He recently sent me a poem he wrote about his mother's death.
Wash your faces!
They were angry.
Tom is a better singer than Mary.
Have you learned to cook or something?
Tom likes to play football.
Sami still has his guitar.
They all love you.
Tom and I can't be both right.
Where is your grandmother?
Get out of here!
They were all happy.
If you translate from your second language into your native language rather than using another language, you will be more likely to minimize errors.
Did you do all this?
Let them help you.
Are you helping him?
Neither Tom nor Mary asked for help.
There is no trust where there is no democracy.
He who is a rich man is a poor man.
Tom and Mary are the same size.
Has anyone died?
No one cares.
Tom threw it away.
Are you lying?
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I'm doing the right thing.
Sami read Layla's message.
I want you to get up.
You refuse to pay.
Tom continued his studies.
Are you lying?
Tom liked Mary.
You have to do this job.
I think you did it involuntarily.
She studies English.
Follow me.
Are you finished?
They all clapped.
Tom and Mary look like John and Alice.
They are dressed.
You should talk to Tom.
Who ran away?
Tom's birthday is on October twentieth.
Forget about it.
A small fire can light a big one.
Tom was surprised.
I saw a dog.
I'm very frightened.
Help me out here.
The season starts in October.
Tell me again who will help us.
I can't just leave you here.
Sami doesn't know who this lady is.
What is this fruit called?
Please take me home.
I hope no one saw you do it.
I like the way you kiss me.
Have you finished your work?
What language is that?
You are a good student.
Is this art?
You'll find that someone left it here.
Who is it?
Are you cold?
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
Go ahead!
Tom and I followed Mary.
Don't eat the fish. It's easy.
Why does Tom need a knife?
Tom is sleepy.
Join us!
If you don't want to study, stop.
Are you crazy?
I bought a bag of mangoes.
We drove there.
Let's dance together.
Please.
Someone has to do something.
They fell.
Are you finished?
Is this guy your friend?
Mary knows that we believe her.
Change your clothes!
We wanted to hear.
Aren't you happy that she's rich?
Look around. What do you see?
Say what you want, I won't believe you.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Sami was out that night.
Take this one.
They all joke.
Tom thought no one had seen him.
What do you feed your dog?
I am not your love.
Sami went to the game.
Tom moved to Boston in October.
The moon remained bright.
Thank you for your call.
I know someone.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
Tom waited his turn.
Tom said he stopped smoking altogether.
You have disgusted me!
Kurt Cobain died on April 5, 1994 in Seattle.
I will return in October.
I have a daughter.
Tom feels uncomfortable.
The police officer visited the palace.
She swims well.
I'll pay with checks.
The trial is over.
Can you call Tom?
Tom bought this for us.
I don't want to go to the party.
I like to read.
Tom was angry and disrespectful to Mary.
Give me a kilo of tomatoes, please.
Keep your strength up.
Sami felt something move towards him.
He is very happy.
You should eat something.
Are we done here?
Take me up there.
Why did you write this book?
Tom wants Mary.
Stop saying that!
There was no one inside.
Say goodbye to me.
You can't stop us.
My grandfather, who still had the same old attitude, always complained about how girls dressed now.
This one's for you.
Don't forget to tell Tom to do that today.
He fought!
Did you know that Zindin Zidan is Kabyle?
Please feed the dog every day.
I have to go check on Tom.
You're a fool to me.
Just let me in.
Are you Canadian?
You're making fun of me.
I'm still seeing Tom.
The exhibition will be held until October 20.
Please.
What you said is correct.
I have to go to Australia next week.
Is there anyone you want to read to?
He fought!
I could kill you.
Would you make her a sandwich?
Tom told me that he loves you very much.
Wash everything.
Tea with lime, please.
I'm feeling all right.
Release the animals from the cage.
They said Tom would be back.
Sorry for calling me.
Shut up!
Sami and Layla were kissing.
You look like a Japanese.
Go to school!
I was a little tired.
Sami is teaching Layla how to play guitar.
You're out of your mind.
I made you coffee.
Tom was warned several times.
Tom showed Mary something.
She is very rude.
It happens.
Mary told me that she was lucky.
Does Tom pray a lot for you?
You're bothering me!
There is no problem at all.
You are joking.
we should meet again.
Someone knows something.
I regret kissing Tom.
You are a mess.
Just look at my new car.
I am happy.
You have a fever.
We remembered.
Who won?
Read this one!
Tom will fail.
I don't know if I have time.
Is the knife you found Tom's?
Sami published his Girl.
She understands it.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
There's someone in the house.
Tom is participating.
Show them.
Listen up, all of you!
Come any time you like.
You are idiots.
Just follow him.
Tom looked me in the eyes.
She might come.
I need someone to help me.
Why does Tom need me?
You have me mad!
Are you really going to send me a Japanese Christmas card?
Sami sees Layla once a year.
Come to us!
You didn't have to do that at all.
Someone is flirting with Tom.
So, how is his hair?
You are dead!
Say goodbye to your friends.
They are looking for help.
I did that without anyone's help.
Stop breaking my head.
Tom never thought he'd do that.
Sami didn't need that.
I can go to your house tomorrow.
I'm not going swimming today.
Your words are meaningless.
Tom seemed happy.
I was born in this hospital.
Are you Ukrainian?
I need you to do one thing.
Tell me the truth.
Tom has been in Boston since October last year.
You have a toothbrush in your teeth.
Give it to whoever wants it.
Do you have many friends who don't eat meat?
Do you have time to eat?
We were all crying.
Tom asked us to be quiet.
She died of thirst.
Tell me something I don't know.
Who invited him?
Marie should start.
It is true.
Let me go!
You will not make mistakes.
The bees make honey.
I know.
Cut it off!
Are you reading?
You are human beings.

They are all waiting.
You should have come to your senses.
The birds are smart.
Call them.
Is Tom kidding around?
Meet me there.
Someone must be stopping us.
Tom is sleeping with someone.
Stop shouting.
Tell him.
I laughed.
Tom was working with Mary.
Tom breathed a sigh.
She was the only one drunk at the party.
Do you know me? - No, I don't think so.
Tom can understand Mary.
Hello to everyone.
God is terrible!
I hope Tom leaves me alone.
Your heritage is rotten, my friend.
Do you know how this works?
Follow your sister's path.
I'm worried about him.
I threw them all out.
Tom and Mary are as different as black and white.
Tom never learned how to read or write.
This will make you stronger.
Tom is your father.
He lost his job.
Why don't you want to go to Tom's house?
You look lovely this afternoon.
Tom is having lunch right now.
Tom died in October.
Things are moving quickly.
Tom was right about Mary.
We all hate him.

I'm not reading.

Tom likes to play.
Chess is popular among Japanese teachers.

Do you have cats?
Tom wanted to help Mary.
Tom is a very clever boy.

You are wrong.

When is the next flight to Boston?
I heard you don't eat meat.
I bought the word.
Tom started his blog in October.
Are you in a hurry to eat all this?
You are really a fool.
Are you Americans?
Give me a different one.
I thought you couldn't read.
Your writing is very good.
Tom almost died.
The chicken is roaring, the chicken is hurting from its bite.
Stop them!
Tom slept only a few hours.
Why are you staring at Tom?
You shout more.
I didn't think Tom would be so tired.
Come by whenever you want.
You can use my dictionary.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Read this now.
Tom pointed it out.
Did you swim yesterday?
Start here!
When was the last time you went to Boston?
Tom told her that he wrote the poem two years ago.

There is a bird eating.
Whatever a person does, whether it be literature, music, art, or anything else, always turns out to be a personal achievement.

I told the truth.
Do you have any girlfriends?
Tom doesn't love me anymore.
Tom is better at singing than Mary.
I guess you like your job.
These notebooks are not mine.
I made you coffee.

Clean your room.

Are you hungry?
Tom doesn't know how to explain it exactly.
Can I go home now?
You are lying.
You're not going to get any grief.
Tom called to say he wasn't coming.
Poetry is medicine, then.
Say it again.
Sami started with this man.
Go ahead and get it!
What do you like better, meat or fish?
Get out of here.
I brought you lunch today.
Tom won't be back until October.
Can you be my door?
Someone approached the door.
Tom wanted to forget Mary.
Tom ran to the counter to see what was going on.
You've finally figured this out!
Nothing hurts like the truth.
He can do that.
They sing.
I'm afraid it's going to rain this afternoon.

Remember that!
Please don't die.
Tom will be third on October 20th.
Sami is a very friendly person.
Can you hear me well now?
Breathe in!
You didn't listen to the children.
I think Tom is brave.
You have a very beautiful smile.
Whose book is this?
I'm pretty sure that Tom loves Mary.
Call him.
This car is brand new.
Your time has come!
They're teasing you.
Look ahead of you.
What happened then?
She stopped talking.
I want you to go with Tom.
The child with the disease was closely monitored by doctors.

Can you leave the door open?
The whirlwind!
Pay attention to your walk.

You danced.
Someone spoke to Tom.
I hope no one saw you come here.
He speaks English well.
Tom is completely out of his mind.
You are so careless.
Are you safe?
Thank you for your offer.
Is that wine?
Keep it.
We need to think about the worst that could happen.
Were you rich?
Tom fell asleep.
I went to school with him.
I want you to work with them.
Be patient with her.
Get rid of me!
Tom and Mary went to her.
He is a good writer.
Where is your aunt?
Tom asked for a big piece.
She is blind.
I closed my eyes.
There was no one inside.
I've been feeling lonely lately.
I wish you a flower of light and flowers with a caramel.
He predicted better for me.
I would suggest that this is not true.
Stay with me.
What is your favorite team?
He was being dumped.
So what?
I'll dream about you.
Give examples.
Someone might see us.
What do you get your dog to eat?
Watch what you eat.
We studied English.
I am being angry.
My computer failed.
Just take me home.
You'll let me cook, or I'll say olive!
Look closely!
The sheep laughed at the poor one.
Tom and I both want to go.
Thank you for your companionship.
Get on the side.
Tom said there was no one there.
She got up.
He is at home today.
Please read it again.
Do you mind if I ask a simple question?
Tom started talking.
Can you please wait a minute?
Let me remind you of something.
I never tried to do that again.
Can you help me?
Can you wait?
I'll tell you a secret.
I can teach you how to read.
You're too proud of yourself!
Someone needs to do something.
Tom is getting ready for the party.
Sami didn't take the last message.
Are you here?
Be careful if you talk to me early.
The old think they are the only ones who are right.
Have you read this?
I'll call you on Monday.
No, I don't know your brother.
I'm not running.
What's happening now?
Is that it?
Are you angry with me?
I'm not washing your car.
I was born in Boston.
Dinner is ready.
I let animals out of their cages.
I must know them.
Would you like something to drink?
You are all happy.
If you ask me, it's a waste of time.
Tom thought Mary would do that.
The one who fights may lose, but the one who does not fight is already lost.
You are Americans.
Someone is sleeping here.
Smell this.
You keep arguing.
It is snowing.
Are you going to study today?
You refused to pay.
Did he use it?
I haven't said anything yet.
We were friends.
I wrote you a note.
I'll meet you downstairs.
There is a word.
Someone is watching you.
Look ahead.
I like reading books.
I'm glad you won.
It's a good one.
How many of these do you need?
Look at us!
I like to walk.
Tom and I were real friends.
Excuse me. Where are the eggs?
Stay in the house.
Tom comes to Boston every weekend to see Mary.
Tom made a fuss.
Are you cold?
Tom put his feet on the ground.
Thank you very much.
You can't come in like that.
How beautiful you are!
Find me now.
I just want to get married.
I like to read.
Write it in French.
Will you do that for me?
I heard Tom's call.
Tom lives near the beach, but he can't swim.
I don't know how long it will last.
Put another ring on.
You're lucky you didn't scream.
My friend doesn't know.
Aren't you from around here?
Are you waiting for someone?
Someone is watching Tom.
Tom turned to Mary.
Please read this book.
We will wait for you here.
Tom is rested.
Tom doesn't quite understand.
I told the truth.
Do you have a dog?
Are you working?
Are you looking for food?
Stop the whining!
Tom couldn't trust Mary.
Somebody must have seen you.
We read.
The matter is settled!
Everyone has you wrong.
Answer me verbally.
Tom is taking off his clothes.
We have to save him from there.
We'll send someone.
You obviously eat a lot.
I'm trying to find another plan.
How much chocolate have you eaten?
How is Tom?
This has to stop.
Tom is sick.
Did Tom get hit by someone?
Tom is in love with Mary.
What are you all afraid of?
He sent me one already.
Bring food.
Which writer do you like?
The dog is barking.
Are you waiting for Tom?
I wish them a year of peace and happiness.
She stopped speaking.
Admit it one more time.
You are fortunate.
You can change that if you want.
Stop contacting me.
Tom only wants a cup of tea.
Try to calm Tom down.
I beg your pardon!
How I miss you!
You should just call Jean.
In my opinion, you are wrong.
Stop shouting!
You have to protect someone.
Tom hated Mary.
Have you read this?
I am very happy for your company.
I'm sorry for Tom.
I hope nothing happened to him.
Go on your way.
A word like "family" has three consonants.
You were in Boston.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
I have something to give you.
Do two things.
He likes to be lazy.
Tom can rest as long as he wants.
Sami was reading a message to Layla.
His staff is covered with a sheet of paper.
I know that I can count on you.
Who are you?
Shut up Tom!
Welcome to Canada!
A mouse only passes by a mouse once.
They live there.
Someone is talking.
I have to be there early.
I'll come and help you.
They're all outside.
You should keep that in mind.
Keep it warm.
Did you eat enough?
You are heroes.
I know you're here, Tom.
She hides her hair.
Why are you crying?
It's not a difficult thing to do.
Send Tom to me.
What are you going to do?
If you change, the next generation will tell you.
Stop it.
Somebody is wrong.
I didn't hit your foot with a stick.
Two beers, please.
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
Stop laughing.
I thought I'd buy something to eat.
Tom will come to the party, too.
Go to my room.
Tom has not returned.
Do you remember?
Don't fight with each other.
Tom always wants to go out with you.
Speak up!
Tom wants Mary.
Tom is a genius.
Tom shouted.
I haven't seen Tom in three days.
Are you brothers?
I'm finished talking.
I don't like you anymore.
You don't owe Tom much money.
I want to know who's coming with us.
The great leaders met in a panic.
Have you answered yet?
Tom was living with his parents in Australia.
Pass me some sugar, will you?
Where is your aunt?
Someone is waiting for you.
Show me your real face.
It is good.
I was in her room.
Keep fishing.
Tom cut it off.
You'll have my car.
Tom swam in cold water.
He was scared and the bullets followed.
What's your name?
Have you read everything?
Sami is speaking with his hands.
I believed everything they told us.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
Tom is just quiet.
Tom is all mine.
Are you going to leave me?
Have you brushed your teeth?
I think he is crazy.
Do you want eggs?
Please don't forget to say hello to your family.
Tom didn't leave Mary.
May I see what's in it, please?
Do you like dogs?
Don't go near that place.
The ground was covered with blood.
I know that I can count on you.
He is a Kabyle.
Tom can't go today.
Where are we going to eat?
Your day will come.
They made Mr. White manager.
You're taller than him.
You are going too fast.
They smile.
Someone has to do something.
What is your philosophy?
Put on your coat. It's cold outside.
Who stole my computer?
Be courteous.
I really like you.
Go and have fun.
I don't want to leave you here alone.
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God".
Tom didn't go to the same school Mary went to.
Tom had no choice but to sit.
Brush your teeth before you go to sleep!
Let me go!
Please take care of him.
Tom is anxious to go alone.
I am starting a new life.
The shooting took place on October 20, 2013.
Aren't you hungry?
I think it's a beautiful tree.
I need to know someone.
Have you become a liar?
Tom reads carefully.
Please lend me your car.
Did they blow them up?
She sat there in silence.
Someone needs to do it.
Are you Swedes?
I live in Australia.
I think Tom is a jerk.
You are lying.
Do you know how to clean?
I've been in Boston for three months.
Don't talk about that.
I just need some help.
The first tree dies young.
The car stopped.
Choose carefully.
Tom was released from prison in October.
I know about that.
I understand your reasons.
Why are you crying?
We want to know you.
You must eat.
The walls and walls are coming down.
They all shouted.
Have you read it yet?
Do you want me to go with you?
I never saw him again.
Is Tom from Australia?
Have you ever cycled to school?
I think Tom is cooking something.
Stop your nonsense!
Do not touch.
Is he Japu's son?
This seminar is good.
When will you consider me your friend?
Can anyone help me?
What do you want from Tom?
Please call him on the phone.
Who was she with?
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
I hope no one saw you come this far.
What is Tom afraid of?
Are you okay?
Let's eat now.
I don't feel like loving you (you, you, you).
Good luck with that!
We left on the 20th of October.
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Tell him.
You were on time.
Stop being so mean to me.
I did that.
Tom and the other cats prayed for rain.
They all love you.
Tom is not our son.
He found you awake.
Someone has to stop you.
It is the 20th of October.
Tom was the one who told me the story.
Are you ready?
Put paper in the tray.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Tom told me he saw someone give Mary a hat.
Stop your tears!
I was a little unlucky.
You are taller than me.
My mother made me a new dress.
Have you been lucky?
I lost my mind.
They know the truth.
I hope you're well.
I read ten books this month.
I know I forgot something.
We built it.
Tom clapped his hands.
Do you smell something?
She swims well.
They were surprised.
Did Moses really hear God speak?
You are dead.
No one is helping us.
Go now.
Eat all you want.
Hold your head!
You're tired of that one.
Tom thinks he's better than everyone else.
We got married in October.
Tom called me.
You must eat.
Tom is not dead.
Someone was shot.
His idea is better than yours.
Does he have a sister?
Stay away from me.
Watch your ears.
Is it hot outside?
Please say it again.
You look like you like this.
I've been thinking about this all day.
He is sharp.
Are you back in Tibet?
Get out of here, open the door!
She is walking.
I haven't learned French in over thirteen years.
You shouldn't call at this time of night.
Do you live here?
Do you know what you've done?
I believe you.
Close your book.
Why don't you sit down? The place is empty.
They look very much like me.
Stop the study!
This place is full of wolves.
Did you eat your snacks?
Go with caution.
My life is in your hands.
The race starts on October 20.
Do you still eat meat?
Just talk to them.
They all speak French.
I miss you so much.
Tom tried to seduce Mary.
Tom told me you didn't win.
I am your father.
What are these people doing?
If you had listened to me, this would not have happened.
Put your arms around me.
What is new?
Are you tired?
Look at this.
Cut it off!
Then why are you here?
Tom almost drowned.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.
I couldn't do this without your help.
I like life.
Did you see anyone here?
What plan did we have?
There are ghosts.
You told the dog to stay, didn't you?
Reading and writing in Kabyle became a habit for us.
You are a mess.
It was a very difficult moment.
You seem worried.
Both Tom and Mary don't speak French very well.
I'm going to ask for a few more sentences.
There is a call.
They all laughed.
I'd like some red wine, please.
He's finished with the dog.
Tom can't eat for himself.
Tom wanted our help.
I was in my life.
I sell computers.
Lying can vary greatly between languages.
I'm going to Boston with Tom and Mary.
I don't like Tom that way.
They all nodded.
Do you need any help, friend?
There are three brothers.
They are happy.
I'm not your friend.
Tom can show Mary.
Tom is a geek.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
You can return your money if you want.
They left early.
Keep listening to me!
Tom was obsessed with Mary.
Mary is pregnant.
Are you at home?
Let me know when you'll call me.
I love you as you are.
Excuse me, who is yours?
Have you gone mad?
Someone could get hurt.
None of these books are useful.
Why are you so smart?
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom plays the violin better than Mary.
Tom is saying he's fine.
He sent them back.
He is running.
You are crazy.
Do you think I will live?
Tom took off his hat.
It's not the same as it was before.
You can eat as much as you want today.
Will they come again?
We played drums.
Look behind you.
I'm here for you.
I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you.
Sami has a lunch break.
Do you think anyone can see me?
I have nothing to say.
Tom has been joking on the phone for an hour.
You are beautiful.
Tom got angry while he was folding the papers.
I hate Tom.
No one looked.
Tom told me not to go there alone.
What do you want to do?
Come and see me.
You should read this.
Are you guys friends?
Sami was singing.
Tom and Mary are farmers.
Please fix it.
I don't like to eat where people smoke.
I don't think Tom needs our help.
Write to me!
They killed me.
He is running.
Have you spoken to your wife?
Why is he so afraid of this?
I'm still in Australia, but I'm going home tomorrow.
Tom opened a bottle of beer.
I like Australia.
Get out of it.
I'm about to go.
Tom is drunk.
They stopped.
You're on your own.
Tomorrow the children will go back to school.
He didn't go in or out.
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Is there anyone there?
There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.
Someone is cheating on Tom.
Tom and Mary broke up last week.
You'd better cut your hair.
Who do you think stole your wallet?
I am so upset about this news.
I like to read books.
Woe to you, you wretch!
Please call if you have any questions.
You are stupid!
I always stay inside the tower.
You are a nuisance.
I called.
Each for himself.
You are stupid!
I'm going to Boston in October.
Did you eat well?
Stay with me.
His job is better than mine.
The story repeats itself.
My beer will be cold.
Be careful if you answer me verbally early.
I ate the chickens.
The meat is good for you.
Are you drunk?
Does Tom pray a lot for you?
Are you finished?
Do you think I should do that?
Do you like to eat meat?
It's a race against time.
I have a fever.
You asked them if they liked one.
We were lucky to have achieved our unprecedented success.
They invited me to their wedding.
The insects taste the water.
Let's play some games.
I don't think Tom would like Boston.
I don't know what I was expecting.
Please answer.
You ran away.
I'm surprised to see you.
Don't forget your money.
Did everyone hear that?
Things are breaking.
Tom is not walking much anymore.
Hamed is quiet.
Why are you washing your hands?
I'll take the most expensive ones.
We both hate it.
Tom told Mary that he planned to stay in Boston until October.
Listen to this!
Do you know when the movie "Star Wars" starts?
Sami got lost in the woods.
I did nothing.
Stay where you are.
Do what you can.
Find another one.
I understand your reasons.
Sami taught him a lesson.
They're mocking you.
Tom has become a jerk.
Tom is a good writer.
Don't bother him.
He came back at six.
This is a bee.
We are in danger.
Tell him tomorrow.
They helped us.
Does Tom work a lot for you?
I feel old.
Are you teachers?
I'm afraid we have a problem.
Tom and Mary are supposed to do this themselves.
Someone opened the door.
Get up off your feet!
I want to go swimming tomorrow.
Tom is a dancer.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
If you don't want to do it, don't!
He's not there.
Bring me some milk, too.
The moon is already shining.
You are a genius!
Can you please wait a minute?
The problem is solved.
It's your turn!
Take this.
Stop them.
I think they've got you wrong.
They have a lot of money.
Tell me the truth.
I speak Old Greek.
You went to school yesterday.
Do you have a house in Australia?
Tom went shopping with Mary.
Tom is a tough guy, isn't he?
Why didn't you read to someone else?
Someone stole my suitcase.
Someone is watching you.
Tom sent me a text and a note.
Take this.
I see we're all here.
We didn't leave you.
Was everyone listening?
Tom is there.
I like French.
I walked.
The birds are flying.
Breathe in!
Your work is taking a toll.
Tom called Mary to tell her he was sorry.
Let the water run.
Sami doesn't like Layla doing that.
Tell me about the Turks in Germany.
Tom started talking.
I didn't know that Tom was dead.
I'm listening to music.
What did you call your dog?
Our dog is black.
Tom is watching.
Who are you talking to?
I have two Canadian friends.
I want to know who read it.
That's it!
It was just a joke.
Tom has been in Australia since October.
Can you find him?
I saw a bear.
Tom was worried.
Do you want to try it?
Yom died on October 20 in Boston.
Stay here.
I thought someone had died.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I think Tom and Mary are missing.
What did you see in Boston?
We were worried about you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
A chicken, please.
Someone has taken my place.
Obviously you're all wrong.
Let's look at this more closely.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
I don't like rosé, so I won't eat it forever.
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
Did something happen?
It is a miracle.
I found someone to help me do that.
Just talk to them.
Look behind you.
You are a problem.
We were reading.
Please call him.
Are you drinking?
Tom understands French well, but he has a speech impediment.
I know the way.
Someone will see us.
Are we finished?
That's it!
Are you Ukrainian?
He refused to believe her.
This is Tom's wife.
To school.
They went to Boston on October 20.
Why did you come to me?
So what?
I don't eat much fruit.
You are my friend, Sami.
He's not missing anything! His day will come!
Tom repeated the phrase many times.
Are you happy?
Hunger does not give bread.
Who will pay for this?
Let's try something.
I forgot about you.
Are you finished?
I want to marry her, but I haven't made up my mind yet.
I'm sure I can handle it.
You are cold.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
You are all invited.
Please go.
Do you want to be alone for the rest of your life?
Open your books!
I speak French fluently.
He is strong as a horse.
Make your room.
Who is against?
My mother is dead.
I like this one. I'll take it.
Stop complaining!
No one paid attention.
Turn to the left!
I don't want you to understand.
I hope you are.
Don't be afraid of mistakes.
We hope you will come often.
Religion has no future.
He speaks French fluently.
Tom is in Australia.
Some people marry before their wives marry someone else.
Has anyone died?
Do you have any answers?
Have you read this book?
Tom's room isn't very big.
Tom was about to leave Mary.
Stop laughing.
Throw me out!
Are you ready?
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Please stand aside.
There was someone talking.
Someone has already done it.
Jim held back from eating.
Follow this way!
This is a gift for you.
Tom and Mary are dancing.
Let me see what you wrote.
Tom may speak French.
They are birds.
I love your son.
Ddaysha likes Akli.
Someone needs to stop Tom.
Did you miss the concert Tom did?
Stop crying.
Tom is mad at Mary.
Are you hot?
Please don't die.
They have a lot of money.
Nature has created languages that man cannot learn all.
Sami's car doesn't stop here.
How many Canadians work here?
Please speak something.
How good!
I can say something.
Hundreds of people eat here every day.
Look behind you.
Do you remember what Tom just said?
We are!
Tom seemed worried.
I don't want to leave you.
We met on October 20th last year.
Will you sing?
My father and grandfather's donkey was a ride on a deck!
I heard someone screaming.
Keep writing.
Tom came into my house.
Are you a Russian?
I never liked biology.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Who swam?
I am not a student.
Get out of here!
I like math.
Why does Tom want me to help him?
Is there anyone else here?
It's a short one, isn't it, Tom?
Tom ate quickly.
Someone tried to kill you.
What time did Tom leave?
Do you write in French?
Tom has to stay, he has no other choice.
What do you want then?
I'm glad to be back.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
Have you ever worked with them?
I want you to work with them.
He went to bed early yesterday.
I wonder why the proverb says, "A foreign chicken is a people's pet".?
Nothing has changed.
If you need help, call me.
Get ready quickly.
Tom has spoken.
It is difficult to choose between the good and the bad.
You are a dog.
Tom cooked potatoes.
The secret has returned to the mountains of Kabylia.
They called.
How beautiful!
Someone wants to warn you.
Where were you in October?
What happened then?
Tom tried to call Mary.
Did anyone call you yesterday?
It's not all right.
"I seem to understand everything", said Tom, "but I'm not sure at all".
The man has no money to borrow.
Are you Chinese?
What do you like better, meat or fish?
Is it okay if I visit you today?
My parents just arrived at the station.
Someone stole my suitcase.
Where is your mother?
Are you drinking?
Put it on the ground.
The birds are singing.
Why did Tom want to stop?
Help me to work.
I'm going swimming tomorrow.
Have you forgotten anything?
The man is already here.
Have you read it yet?
Is something bothering you?
I heard people speaking French in the bus.
There is no god.
Someone searched my room.
Sami's car won't start.
Help me out.
I wonder.
Can you fix that?
Someone was knocking.
She was ill.
Nothing is going to change.
I left Australia three years ago and have never returned.
Get out of the way!
You are crazy.
I need you here.
Someone has to do something.
My life is in your hands.
Do it
Are you a witch?
We need someone.
Listen, please.
Aren't you going to my place?
Do you like my friend?
There is too little milk in the pot.
It hurts as much as it hurts.
I saw a conversation with Tom.
I'll stay at home the next time you come.
I'm happy for your success.
Is there anyone you want to see?
Then God forbid the green eggs you used to beat him with didn't cook! He would have been a total idiot!
I don't know Tom very well.
You should go home.
He's not there.
There is one now or was here.
Children learn by example.
Tom seems very happy.
Are you going swimming this afternoon?
We arrived in Osaka the day before yesterday.
Please don't go and read what this creature is saying!
They are all happy.
I want a lot of money.
Do you know where he was born?
I'm glad to see you too.
What are you reading?
Tom suggested someone make him eat.
Tom is a wuss.
Tom likes to sing.
You two talk.
I'm out of words.
He played.
Tom was lucky that Mary wasn't there with him.
My job is to wash clothes.
This website contains a summary in Kabyle with lessons and guidelines and with an edit.
I'm playing it by ear.
Tom told you he was going back to his hometown.
You are a thief.
Are you all right?
Did someone hit Tom?
Clean the mirror.
What did you do today?
Tom and I talked about many different things.
What are you doing?
He is a pervert.
Let's play this game.
Why didn't you call me earlier?
Are they new?
It didn't help.
Keep up!
He wants another cup of coffee.
He put a bullet in his chest.
Tom will be heard.
It seems like I'm here too early.
Your father will be happy to see you back soon.
You'll find someone left it here.
There's someone outside.
Someone might hear you.
The truth?
Tom hopes to see you in October.
I was hoping you could show me how to do that.
Do you speak Latin?
I think there's someone in the front room.
Please answer.
Please don't forget to exchange the letter.
Are you an artist?
I cut your tongue.
I will never forgive you.
Why do you want all this?
Tom always seems to win.
Someone already sent me.
You are drunk.
Your time has come!
You lied to me.
Mr. West called while you were gone.
I haven't changed. You have.
Is that right?
By day, they are whispering; by night, they are whispering. What is it, what is it? It's a doorbell.
Everyone likes to play games.
How have you been spending your weekend so far?
Tom is dancing.
Come and dance.
I worked for about a week in one afternoon.
Where did the money go?
They all came to me!
I need to talk to someone.
I want to have someone to talk to.
I'm from Japan.
You are beautiful.
I don't think you should do that.
I'm angry with Tom.
Tom called Mary.
See you later, Tom.
I can't go swimming with you tomorrow.
Tom didn't cheat on you alone.
Tom turned it dark on Mary.
You can eat now.
You ran over Tom.
Someone has already been here.
What are you doing?
Take this one.
It's a cold day today.
Tom kissed Mary.
Do you want me to read it to you?
Sami likes to do that.
I know we're brave enough for this.
There is something different.
She takes her medication every hour.
I hope Tom doesn't tell me to do that.
I will never forget it.
She stopped laughing at me.
Tom is talking.
I can't help Tom today.
I met her once on this street.
I am being angry.
So what?
Stop there.
In fact, he likes her too.
I'm afraid for you.
Mary is a good girl, but she talks a lot.
Did you buy it in Boston?
These are our old phrases. We've heard them for ages!
Mary is very beautiful, but not very smart.
I might go to Boston in October.
I hope the truth.
Bring some milk too.
Sami traveled through Egypt by car.
I want to buy a house in Australia and stay for a year.
How much do you believe him?
I don't think he is well.
Hello to you all!
In our house, the maid told everyone to wash their dishes.
This is a diamond.
I have to read the book.
I've got some business.
Listen to this!
Someone might hear you.
I already told you that I didn't do that.
Sami never considered himself a Christian.
Two mountains and a rock, they stand between us, says Crifa.
Tom told me a story.
I'm not going to leave you, Tom.
Do you think anyone can see me?
Are you finished?
I returned from Boston on October 20.
You can't answer either.
Someone is singing.
Eat this cake. It will help you sleep.
I can't remember your name.
Tom doesn't care who's looking at him.
Mary bought Halloween costumes for the children.
I asked Tom to sweep the room.
Listen, Tom can't know you're here.
I can't do that for you now.
Here's what you asked for.
Are you lying to me?
Someone heard.
Are you from Kyoto?
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
I can swim.
You are a panda.
I saw someone give Tom a hat.
Someone is climbing the stairs.
Can they hear outside?
Tom's room isn't very big.
Tom did as Mary said.
Try to fix it.
Maybe we should tell someone.
Spring has arrived.
I don't know how long it will take.
I was wrong about you.
The argument is over.
Your mother eats vegetables.
It's good that you're telling the truth.
You ate and drank.
They are using you.
From your hearts?
Tom fired him.
I'll call you this afternoon.
Did Tom really say that he thought about staying in Australia?
Tom visited Australia last summer.
Have you gone mad?
Here he is to annoy me.
Tom may have been in Australia since October.
I like snow.
Are you all that stupid?
Stay sharp!
Keep looking!
Are you people?
Remember about it.
You won't die here.
That's what everyone thinks.
Come on in here.
He washed my feet.
Sami asked Layla to do him a favor.
Is that not true?
Tell him.
You will pick it.
Someone is following us.
I went too.
You can now consider Layla your girlfriend.
Someone poisoned us.
Are you a builder?
Many countries have laws that prohibit smoking.
Will he come back?
A room for rent.
I might be able to go to Boston in October.
You were in Boston.
But what is it?
I walked by myself.
You are beautiful.
We have until October to finish our work.
Hello, my dear.
I know I can't win.
This job will be good.
I'll meet you there in five minutes.
Tom and I were never close friends.
I'm going to buy three tickets.
I wanted to be a farmer.
Please come this way.
I'd rather have a bath.
Someone called.
Questions will be asked of the reader of the case, and he will have to answer them.
I'm an old friend of Tom's.
Is it okay for me to smoke?
Are they dry?
You are covered in black.
I'm used to the heat.
I don't like to eat alone.
Don't you see any of this?
Tom said he wanted to do that.
I came yesterday.
Someone needs to talk.
Have you gone mad?
Give them something to eat.
They all speak Romanian.
We can never do it.
Something was wrong.
They won't tell me how Tom died.
Where are you?
When are you having lunch?
Why don't you go out and play?
Love is making you blind.
Tom was found dead on October 20.
Please be quiet.
Go carefully.
They have guests.
Tom deserves that.
Mary lied to Tom.
Tom will come with you when he's done with his work.
Is that your last question?
I am out of work.
I'm a friend of his brother.
What sport do you work in?
Tom gave us a lot of food.
Turn off the TV.
Sami was fighting the gym teacher.
Sami is winning.
If you want to eat this, you can.
My father is not at home.
Tom likes to talk about golf.
What is your goal?
They don't know yet.
Tom is smiling.
How kind he is!
Come to the house.
Stop singing.
What are your names?
We speak French.
Keep singing!
I won't do you any harm.
Don't punish Tom for that.
Tom and Mary had a good afternoon.
How many Pawns have you got?
The monk put on a coat and his son picked it up.
We're not feeling well right now.
They screamed.
Tom said he would come tomorrow.
Tom is surprised by his dryness.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
You are a fool!
Tom and Mary broke up.
Tom and Mary have the same idea.
I like their house.
You can always change.
I wish I could go to Australia in October.
Tom is a man of his word.
Show it to Tom.
Go this way.
You are idiots!
I like history.
Everyone is lying.
Stop whining!
I guess you like your job.
Don't add more bullets to the boxes, at least! He's a jerk, he's a jerk!
Do you have some water?
Tom died on October 20th.
She is cold.
I'm not going to.
She writes well.
We can't blow up a house with a hammer.
Tom likes to sing.
I've always liked to swim.
Don't you remember what Tom did to Mary?
I can do it myself.
We are teachers.
Without a doubt.
No one knows.
I want you to get up.
Tom returned to Boston last October.
Do not open the door.
Did you sleep a little?
When did you buy this bag?
Did someone call you?
I want you to come right now.
Are you smiling?
I really don't like Australia.
Sami's glasses are not suitable for Layla.
Have you finished your work?
This will make you stronger.
I want you to try this.
I know you left early.
He was thirsty.
You can use this dictionary.
Call them.
Get out of here!
Why do you want all this?
Sami was there.
Why didn't you go to Boston last summer?
There is one following us.
He likes to walk.
Where is your God now?
I don't know Tom anywhere.
We met for the last time.
Does this make you happy?
Were you surprised to see her?
I killed a rabbit.
Tom is lost.
They're inside.
Tom can't help us.
What's the use of having a car if you don't drive?
I'll be here on Monday.
Tom kissed Mary.
Don't leave me alone.
No one will find him.
We miss you all.
I'm not interested in religious matters.
You shouldn't eat too many sweets.
You have to be careful.
My jeep is long.
Are you new here, or not?
Get out of here.
Your smile always makes me happy.
Sit here.
The sun was obscured by clouds.
It is good.
Tom and I spoke on the phone.
Burn your room!
We were worried about you.
Your friends are waiting for you.
I'm the one who pays all the bills.
Tom knocked on Mary's door three times.
Don't you swim?
Tom went to Australia.
Tom and I both want to go.
Tom eats when he's worried.
Tom told me that he might go to Boston.
Where will your friends sleep?
You guys are really crazy!
Snow has blocked all transportation systems in all regions of the country.
He goes to school early.
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom doesn't remember Mary.
Why didn't you go to Boston last summer?
Have you gone mad?
I did this for you.
I'm crazy about my luck.
Tom wants to stop Mary.
This is my opinion, not yours.
Do you know which room the meeting will be in?
Last year, I visited Dubrovnik.
I thought there was someone in the other room.
Australia is not a desert.
Tom and Mary have already kissed.
Tom is a Christian.
What book are you reading?
Tom will forget Mary.
I learned to drive.
I already told Tom that I wanted to stay in Australia for three weeks.
Both Tom and Mary don't want to do that.
I had some trouble finding a taxi.
Can I?
My head hurts.
That's the way to go.
I need help now.
Can I talk to you alone?
The subject is over.
The woman was talking to my sister.
I could be stopped by anyone.
Tom is up.
Tom fell down.
You're not used to drinking a lot of water.
That's right!
Be careful!
The wings fell.
Are you asleep?
At night, it was snowing and cold.
Tom doesn't respect Mary.
Read me!
You should learn English.
We all love him.
Can you find her?
Do you believe in ghosts?
Shut up!
I am Tom's mother.
There's nothing there.
What's in your heart is reflected in your face.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Do you like Germany?
Tom said he liked it very much.
Didn't you know that Tom had decided to go to Boston with Mary?
I haven't smoked in a long time.
Find out what!
Please use the table!
There is no going back.
Sami and Layla are looking.
I'm happy for you.
Someone has to stop you.
Wait! They're ready!
How far is Tom from Boston?
Children like to play hide-and-seek.
You have a sports book.
Maybe someone wants it.
Some of Hans Christian Andersen's stories have been translated into Kavalib.
I don't have children.
How then?
You just bought my new car.
Tom is in a bad state.
Tom is a jerk.
Do you have a dog?
Don't tell anyone.
Change your clothes!
Do you have any friends?
Do you remember?
Let the water cool.
Tom is covered in snow.
Let go of Tom.
I just spoke to him.
Come on now!
You should have done that with us.
Let's sleep on it.
He was shocked.
You should eat breakfast every day.
Listen to this!
Someone is calling now.
We don't think that is true.
Eli Deflawen is a popular Kabyle singer.
She is respectful.
I visited Boston that summer.
I'll call you today.
You're older than Tom.
You are not related.
Do you know where he was born?
Tom is lazy.
My mother had been ill for two days.
Don't forget to tell Tom that he has to do that.
Are you sick?
Please find him.
Tom doesn't get along with Mary.
They were not just friends.
I like to walk alone.
What time are you going to eat?
Don't bother. It's easy.
Is there anyone you'd like to help?
What are we waiting for?
Tom has a crush on someone.
Your computer won't work!
Someone has to speak.
Is something bothering you?
Tom has a black car.
Have you considered them?
Someone is looking at you.
Fish, please.
I want to know what you like to eat.
It was a bad day.
Sami wants to stay home.
Are you alone?
No one died.
Watch your eye!
Have you had dinner or not?
Where did he go?
Tom was hired in October.
Tom bought a girl older than him.
"So you believe him?" "Absolutely!"
Tom seems rich.
The one who doesn't talk agrees.
I've told you twice.
You are right.
Please stand up.
Tell the truth.
You are stupid.
It's good.
You'd better cut your hair.
Give your money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.
This is obviously art.
I have not forgotten you at all.
I am a human being.
Have you seen the new movie?
They all jumped.
Say it another time.
Where's the pen?
I do not eat fruit.
What will you eat tomorrow?
When will Tom be back from Boston?
Get off me.
Give it to whoever you want.
Tom took Mary's place.
She took my hand.
Why can't we play tennis today?
Have you read?
He hit him.
You don't have to work.
Did you stop Tom?
I want to eat here this afternoon.
Do you see the star?
Do you write in French?
Your older sister will meet you.
Two beers, please.
You're better than Tom.
Tom threw me the apple.
A little cat is sitting on a trash can.
I am a foreigner.
Someone poisoned us.
Everything is where it expects to be.
From your heart?
Do you have daughters?
He is a child who follows the advice of his parents and teachers.
Hello again!
It's your faces.
Are you jealous of me?
If he wants you, get something.
Switzerland is a country of railways.
Arabic is not my language, I am Kabyle.
Are you scared?
October was difficult.
Have you read this?
Probably not.
There's someone inside.
I don't care if you kiss Tom or not.
I want a study.
Open the door.
Tom and I went to Boston to see Mary.
This is your father Tom.
Tom was the first to finish the test.
This time it's not the same.
I'm sorry about that.
It is raining.
He went to visit her when she was living in London.
Someone is calling now.
I want you to work with them.
October is a busy month.
We all miss you.
I have to study.
Take Tom home with you.
I'll eat here.
The truth is harsh.
I ate.
I didn't stay long in Boston.
What do you want from us?
Tom wants to marry Mary.
Tom can't drive.
Sami knows where she lives.
Why does Tom need my help?
I shouldn't kiss Tom.
You didn't help me.
I won't eat at home this evening.
Look at her.
You are happy.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
He picked up a bag and went straight to the market.
Take this one.
When are you going?
Sami is tired of Layla.
Why are you crying?
You guys! Who do you think they're going to electrocute? I don't see!
The lights went out, and people went home.
They were all happy.
A fire broke out at night.
Why are you alone?
I like to read.
Go and have a laugh.
Take your hands off me.
We didn't leave you.
Swimming is good for your health.
France is a republic.
Take care of yourselves.
Just wait here.
Tom was somebody.
Mary built it.
Tom and Mary are smiling.
Someone came to the door.
Sami is used to eating raw food.
You're going to have a little sister.
Tom is a bad boy.
She lost everything she had.
Behind you.
Who is standing?
Hold on to Tom.
Tom said he knew who did it.
Tom is rich.
I'm not going to talk about this with him.
Who knows what it is.
What is your friend's name?
I told you it would work.
You are a witch.
You are blinded by love.
Football is like football in this country.
I'm not going.
I'm wearing my clothes.
You are going too fast!
See you, Ian.
Do not underestimate your own worth.
Stop them.
If I remember correctly, Tom's birthday is October 20.
Get ready!
Are you blind?
Eat all you want.
How long will we have to wait?
Life is beautiful.
It is windy.
How beautiful!
Why didn't you take him home?
Tom wants to.
This dictionary is completely wrong.
Did you find anything?
You should have come to your senses.
Did you mistake Tom?
Do not be shy.
You seem very worried to me.
They're all outside.
What do you want from Tom?
Why do you want all these tips?
Did you notice that I was talking about a tree?
If Tom can't do it, no one can.
I really need to eat something.
I've made many mistakes in my life.
Are you hungry?
They have a problem.
Put your clothes on!
Tom is coming.
How long has Tom been learning French?
I play the guitar.
Why not?
I'll ask Tom to do that.
Did you find anything?
I realized that Tom really loves me.
I like to sleep.
Tom and Mary both have the same idea.
We all hate you.
Do you know Tom's password?
You can invite Tom home this afternoon.
We know that you didn't kill Tom.
Sami was in Tahiti.
Try to get Tom to do that.
Tell me who you are!
No one knows why.
Is this love?
Are you guys okay?
Tom can see Mary.
One, two, three, go!
Are you kidding?
I heard someone talking.
Tom thought I was Mary.
What boy?
We don't have a book.
How many eggs do you eat a week?
Tell Tom what you want.
Someone is talking.
Have you read this?
I'm waiting for the call this morning.
What does all this mean?
You must follow the rules.
Do good to those who hate you.
What do you want?
Stop being a witch.
It's really sad.
I need someone to talk to.
Say 'ahhh'.
I don't like Tom.
Let me see what you wrote.
Keep laughing.
I write paper quickly.
We need more than one.
You should have come to your senses.
Is there anyone you want to see?
Come with me.
Be yourself.
You have plenty of time.
However, I just said this: the odds have always been stacked against you.
Are you Canadians?
I hope I do it again.
There is no garage in Tom's house.
Someone has to speak.
I respect you.
October 20th is a busy day.
At that moment, it started to rain heavily.
Tom drives faster than Mary.
Write your name.
Someone was murdered.
No one spoke.
You can return your money if you want.
I disagree with you on this matter.
It's our car.
I believe you.
Do as you like.
I'm tired of watching TV.
The record never got eaten.
Can you help me again?
They are all waiting.
Your success is dependent on your hard work.
Which tooth hurts you?
Please come today if you're feeling well.
Tom lied.
How many cookies have you eaten?
Can I see the list, please?
Be careful!
Tom tried to save Mary.
Tom regretted that they had to do it.
You need someone like me.
Tom is your father.
I don't think I like that.
Are you angry?
Take it all.
Does Tom drink?
Sami saw Layla leave the Walmart.
What are you going to do with this?
I didn't read it right.
Who invited you to the party?
Tom kissed Mary.
They are angry.
I don't understand how this could happen.
The pen you're holding is mine now.
What were you reading to her?
Tom and I are going to be neighbors.
How long will you be staying in Boston?
Tom likes French.
He stayed at home.
Leave that with you.
What are you trying to tell me?
A year of snow is a year of grain.
Snow is cold, but beautiful.
Stop it!
I have to find a way out of here.
He went to the pub to get some beers.
I think Tom is much older than me.
Read yourself.
Do we have one?
Please be quiet.
Sami believed his mother.
I can't do it any other way.
Hokkaido is in the north of Japan.
Tom was born in Australia.
They waited.
Did you hear what they said?
I am in the womb.
Who told you that Tom would be here?
Can you take a picture for us?
How will they know?
He saw me right away.
Write to Tom!
Are you okay?
You look busy.
It seems I came too early.
I've never tried to ride a bicycle.
Tom ran outside to see what had happened.
Tom is the kind of man I like.
Who was saved?
Tom stopped at a park.
They celebrate Halloween in October.
Why don't you do something?
Tom threw a lot of money at me.
Are you new?
Get in the car!
Save the cat.
You work too much.
Someone came to our house.
My husband is a good man.
Tom is wearing a bra.
Tom said he'd never heard Mary sing.
It's like sleeping.
Tom is going to Boston in October.
I will never love him as I love you.
Who speaks French?
Do you have a house in Australia?
Leave them alone.
Tom is breathing.
Tom was spared.
I like to pee.
Someone is sleeping on this bed.
You have a black book.
Mary and Tom want to buy a house.
Tom told me that he knew someone who gave Mary a hat.
I like apples.
I went to a Halloween party.
Who spoke?
We were wrong.
I believe you.
I'm stuck here in Australia.
I know everything.
I'm cold.
Have you read it?
He died.
Tom came home three hours ago.
Tom let his dogs out.
I love you very much.
Come home early!
Tom went into the kitchen.
You are dead.
Obviously they didn't read us.
Apples are big.
I got a headache.
They won.
It's easy for you to use.
You have no heart.
Stay where you are.
What a wretch!
Somebody has to do it.
If I thought so, I would tell you.
I have prepared a poem, do you want me to read it to you?
Can you help me, please?
Did she use them?
Thank you for telling us that.
That of my brother.
They all died.
Is this Tom?
Learn from it!
We need a car.
I don't eat fish if it's not good.
Call them.
Please just tell me what's going on.
Tom is trembling.
When I come back from the mosque where I pray, I like to have a glass of wine before going to bed.
She built it.
I will be thirty in October.
Be reasonable.
Tom is really heavy.
Tom is up.
It's all right!
It's time to go home.
Come here!
Sami bought two bottles at Amazon.
No! No! It is not!
Do you work?
Does Tom work for you?
The words "skull" and "skull" come from the same root as "skull": the ice of the fingers that can be broken.
The aunts are crazy.
You are all crazy.
Sami is scared.
Tom speaks French.
Stop smoking.
Can any of us speak Spanish?
She doesn't say.
Tom didn't see it.
Send me up there.
Which one of your brothers is the oldest?
This happens from time to time.
Why are you calling?
I continued to sing.
Everyone knows that it's Tom's car.
Do you smoke?
His appearance has changed dramatically.
You are crazy to continue working in a place like this.
I understand.
Tom is screaming.
Tom didn't bother Mary.
Tom changed jobs.
It is a bird.
There is no hope of his recovery.
Welcome to the light.
Stop whining!
I'm here as a friend.
It's better if you don't do that while Tom is here.
These girls love you both.
Tom and I haven't known each other very long.
I saw one give Tom a hat.
Can you give this to Tom?
I ran into Tom again today.
There is nothing better than love.
I'll be in Boston until October 20.
Where did you learn Italian?
Let's try something.
I'll go with you.
Stop crying.
Have you seen my sister?
Layla cut her hair.
Look at that!
Tell them the truth.
We won.
I'm not washing your car.
I met a man whose father knew Tom.
I'm not here to hurt you.
You have been selected.
Sami ran up the roof.
The smile.
Someone opened the door.
I thought we were friends.
Are you ready?
I want to eat Chinese food for dinner.
Burn your room!
You must follow the rules.
She is a Kabyle.
We have guests this evening.
You listen to me!
The church follows the Algerian Protestant Church, a Christian denomination for Protestant churches.
You guys are a disaster in the kitchen.
Someone is smarter than Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
You don't eat too fast, do you?
Life is going on.
Was Adam really a scientist?
I love you as you are.
Tom has been talking about you all day.
No one has gone there.
They're gone.
You should eat something.
This way.
I asked Mr. Smith.
Your sister is the smartest of all the other students.
You can't go in with that.
It looks good.
The boy stole money from his mother's purse.
Don't you know that Tom and Mary are still working like this?
Tom married Mary.
What time was it when you got here?
Look around you.
You are reading.
Help us out.
Who are you?
I feel a little bit of it.
Tom didn't know that Mary loved him.
Boys and girls play together.
Your eyes are lying.
No one knows.
I'm listening to music.
It's up to Tom.
Tom didn't ask Mary to help him.
He was imprisoned for writing the book.
I know your language.
Art is long, life is short.
Tom is ready to work.
I don't want to talk about my son.
Tom and I got married young.
Tom is lost.
I haven't seen Tom since the Halloween party.
Forget about it.
We can do something.
He ran.
Tom looks at Mary.
Sami got up to pray the dawn.
Who will replace Tom if he isn't?
Someone wants to send a letter.
Tom died of cancer in October.
You seem to know how to do this.
They are the same age.
No one told me it would be so cold.
You did not help me.
Here he is again.
I believe him.
October 20 was a hot day.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
He thinks like a child.
Tom is a smart boy.
Why did you go there?
Where are your dogs?
Tom was just so suspicious.
What are you doing this weekend?
Your work is half done.
All faith comes from religion.
Tom tries to keep his eyes open.
Keep playing.
Our dog is black.
Your mother eats vegetables.
Mary is cooking.
Show me something I don't know.
Are you all right?
They love their Kabyle culture.
I know you'll find a way to do that.
Someone was watching us.
I know who he is.
Wait outside.
It really hurt my feelings.
I want someone else.
Close the room.
You're hiding something.
Are you here?
Didn't you know that Tom was thinking of going to Boston with Mary?
Tom wanted to scare Mary.
Good friendship is when there is agreement.
You're wrong, which I should have been!
The snow is melting.
Someone forgot his bag.
The country is covered with snow and ice.
Someone has been taken.
Tom can do what he likes.
Please, do not be angry.
Someone stole my car.
Are you fast?
You are the love of my life.
When the bread is hot, we make olive oil.
Aren't you tired?
Do they all like music?
I was in Boston last year on October 20th.
Let's go with speed.
I'm not your slave.
Why are you sitting alone?
No one answered.
It is true.
I turned to the right.
Who knows why Tom refused the job.
I don't need your work.
Naomi has been very happy since she won the award.
Tom wasn't kissing Mary.
I'll see you at dinner.
Tom did a good job for us.
I wonder if he loves me.
Amayas likes to eat onions.
Pass me some sugar, please.
Tom is upset.
How are you, Tom?
It's good. No one is wrong.
It's a good life.
I lost my pen.
Who went with you?
Are you ready?
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
Tom has been crying ever since.
Are you there?
She picked up a bag and went straight to the market.
He started to panic.
Get out of here!
Leave your shoes outside before you enter.
This week, I've been writing a blog for almost two months; although it's hard, Kababil still needs a lot of work. So, who are we to greet it with these?
Please answer.
Is there anyone you'd like to read to?
The bride was beautiful.
She didn't buy any bread.
Tom was at the zoo in October.
Kiss him.
Can I go home now?
They saw nothing.
Tom and I haven't seen each other for a long time.
I hate fighting.
Tom continued his studies.
I didn't say Tom wasn't smart.
They all found themselves.
Stalin died and all Algerians wept.
What Tom said was meaningless.
Mary bought a wedding dress.
Do you know if you love us?
Are you German?
Tom may have been tempted to do that, too.
She kissed me.
Someone is coming.
Tom is the one who said Mary didn't love him.
They have wine.
We can!
Are you dying?
She is terrified.
Come here.
Do you have any answers?
Tom is angry at Mary.
Do you know anything about your family?
They all survived.
Do you have a brother, Ana?
The wind is strong.
No one knows why.
Are there people to judge?
I was about to go out when the phone rang.
If you want something.
I won 100 euros a day.
Tom never forgets.
Tom slammed the door in anger.
We are the light of the world.
He wrote her a message.
Take it all.
You know exactly how it happened.
Did anyone ask Tom why he did it?
Tom is bored.
Let me go!
I heard otherwise.
This project was approved last October.
Tom wasn't used to it.
Tom and Mary were sitting in the back.
Is it Friday?
You keep going.
Have some coffee.
They agreed.
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
I want to walk with you.
Coffee is bad for your stomach.
You must come to me.
Is there anyone to judge?
I came back to talk to you again.
Someone stole my money.
Did you know Mary before joining the band?
The pool is good for you.
Ask around.

Send this letter by plane.
My upper left cheekbone is sore.
We learned French.
How do you spend your time in Boston?

Tom hasn't seen them since October.
Come and eat!
Do you have anything hot to drink?
I'm glad you won.
Are you guys gay?
Tom joined in.
Sami has arrived in Egypt.
You look surprised.
We should look into each other's eyes before we say goodbye.
She stopped smiling at me.
The leaves melt like snow in the sun.
Tom can wait.
That's not true either.
It is a curse.
I have to tell someone.
I'm here for you.
Tom heard the rumor of a bear attack.
Mary never kissed her husband in public.
Look ahead.
Listen to this!

Please come in.

Shops are closed on Sundays.
Read the article.
I am in Tel Aviv.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
This woman is a disgrace. She looks like a ghost, and she is even more so than a ghost!
Thank you for your friendship.
Tell that to Tom.
Write to Tom!
Let me go!
Brush your teeth as soon as you finish eating.
Don't be mean to me.
Are you Japanese?
Get a shovel.
Everyone disrespected them.

I was overweight.
How are you doing?
Someone called the security forces.
I can't do that for you now.
You came into my room.
I can't tell you the truth.
I asked Tom to forgive me for what I did.

He bought with me.
What a paella!
Let me go!
Tom and I are late.
Who ordered the pizza?
How can I find him?
Have you read?
The hard part is over.
I shouldn't have done that.
Turn on the TV.
I have changed.
Do whatever you want.
You have made me crazy!
I'm a little worried.
I read books.
Who were they with?
Are you crazy?
She laughed at it.
Why do you want all this?
I followed her.
Have you eaten?
Sami and Layla were friends.
Do you have a bicycle?
They will find them.
Tom must be fine.

Probably not.
Watch out for something!
You look like an Indian.
What time did you get here?
Who remembers?

It is expensive.
He knows how to play with words.
Call me when you get back.
You are a fool.
Tom is determined to return to his home in Boston.
Let your sister go.

You are too tall!
Tom likes books.
You can read this book.
Forgive Tom.
Try it!
They cut flowers.
I stayed at home.
Someone is watching you.
Tom refused to eat lunch.
Nobody cares who you are.
I've already told them all that.
Will you do that for me?
Stop singing.
I need someone to talk to.
Are you scared?
You hit Tom.
Someone said, "I met two cooking balls. I didn't understand anything".

Answer my questions.
They are cleaning the beach.
I will return to Australia on October 20.
I hope no one sees you like this.
Say something!
It is!
Tom and Mary fight all the time.
Did you learn to cook or something?
Someone has been born to me.
Stop complaining.
Bring us two egg sandwiches, two cups of coffee, three ounces of apples, please.
I don't want to think I hate him.
I grew up in Australia.
I want to start a family.

Is that Tom's father?
Who else is there?
I hope no one saw you come here.

They are hot.
Get out of here!
I'll call you every morning.
Please read this book.
Can you fix that?
Are you lying?
My brothers!
You can change that if you want.
Have you never called them?
Have some patience.
Try to get Tom to do that.
Wait a minute!
I hope we don't bother you.
My grandfather doesn't know what a native is.

Where's your key?
They look very much like me.

You have no heart.
We'll wait for you here.
I'm not your maid.
I want to go see a movie.
Keep your eyes open.
Will you come?
The answer to that question is simple.
Tom is tired.
It's as if Tom knew that Mary had done that.
You are on your own.
Can you fix this?
Is there anything you want to read?
Just take me home.
I was bitten by a snake.
Can you swim?
Please continue!
I'll ask you one thing.

You can buy and read any book category you want whenever you want.
Are you mad?
Does what I say make sense?
Who answered?
Did you see him?

I mocked him.
Let's try something.
I hope no one saw you do that.
Someone is sleeping on this bed.
You're not Japanese.

Please.

Nothing has happened.
The number is just a number.

Someone heard.
Tom seemed very happy.
Why are you reading this?
I'm drinking a glass of rosé.
What kind of games do you like?
Can you read this?
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm busy on Monday.
Are you stupid?
Are you Germans?
I'll find a way.
Tom didn't eat pizza yesterday.
What time will you eat?
Turn to the left!
Tom is in Boston, but Mary is not.
Someone called the security forces.
Stay back.
Do we not care?
He looks tired.
Everyone is talking.
Open the door.
That's when I received your letter.
I don't want to eat the leftovers.
His suitcase is too heavy.
I have something to give you.
What will you drink?
Move again!
Tom is standing.
I could kill you.
It worked.
They slept.
You are a fool.
They want to be soldiers.
Stop them!
Have you read this book yet?
This is your slave, isn't it?
I'll talk about the lyrics.
Do you see what I mean?
It's the same as last time.
Do you think I should do that?
We are on Thursday.
Keep my clothes on.
It's going to snow today.
He is a child in his mind.
Tom is not polite.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom saw someone looking at him.
She takes this medicine every four hours.
I was really happy to be back in Australia.
Sami knows who it is.
She just wants to have fun.
How beautiful this city is!
Tom doesn't tell the truth every day.
Someone came into the room.
The snow has stopped.
I'm very sorry for you.
I need to know someone.
Tom and I are married.
Stop crying!
Try to convince Tom to leave this early.
She likes to eat.
Tom saw something.
Can you please wait a minute?
Can I take your picture with us?
This one's for you.
Is my answer correct?
The time has passed.
Who told you Tom didn't win?
What's Tom doing tomorrow?
Tom and Mary got married in October.
Are you kidding me?
I'd like a coffee, please.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
Tom seems to want to go with you.
The emperor returned.
Go to the house.
Don't sit there.
Go and get some sleep.
Tom, you're a witch.
Did you ever notice Tom?
Are you helping him?
Just talk to them.
I hope no one saw you come here.
I don't understand art.
Get away from me!
Try to find out.
We should go.
Please help me.
Have you gone mad?
I'm asleep, how about you?
You speak English well.
Why didn't you call Tom to remind him?
Dreams with a twinkle in their eye!
This is Mary's husband.
Tom is a writer.
Bring me a cup of coffee, please.
I bought a bottle of water.
Mary told Tom that she didn't like her job.
It's a bad life! It's a bad world!
This store opens on Mondays.
Tom is very awake.
Do you have any other questions to ask?
You can call me tonight.
It's for adults only.
It's better if you don't talk to Tom.
Bring Tom.
We spoke.
What was in the room?
Tom knew something.
I voted for Ken.
Everyone has dreams.
I can forgive Tom.
Can anyone tell me why Tom is angry?
This is for you.
Take off your boots.
I finally found a place where we can be alone.
I could kill you.
I beg your pardon.
The snow is melting.
Just hit him with a stick.
Tom will always love Mary.
Spring has arrived.
No one will believe us.
Be honest with yourself.
I hurried home.
Tom doesn't want to talk to us.
Someone is calling you.
Your mother eats vegetables.
Get up, you old fool, for you have lost your temper.
Why don't you drink the truth?
It's a short one, Tom: or what?
It was a sunny day.
Say "yes".
Tom passed in front of Mary.
Someone stole my money.
Look at the way you look!
What a mess, Tom!
You speak too fast.
I'm not used to working outdoors.
You have friends, don't you?
They all laugh.
She's been busy since yesterday.
Finally, the guests left, and the house was quiet.
I could kill you.
We will march one after the other, one in front of the other, and take our rights.
They told me.
Where does your grandmother live?
Tom let his dogs out.
Tell them I'm here.
You little shit!
Are you a witch?
What are you reading?
You swim better than I do.
Tom killed a rat with his axe.
What is your friend's name?
I answered them.
Children like Halloween.
Is French difficult?
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
Is there anything we can do?
This takes a year.
You are teachers.
Tom almost hurt Mary.
His name is Tom.
You are good.
We had good times in Boston.
Shut up!
Don't look at me.
Tom is bored.
Chuck Norris was born in the house he built.
I have a heavy Internet connection.
It's just getting dark.
I'll buy you something to eat.
She's ready to go.
What time did you get here?
You are all in agreement.
Get up!
Can you pass me the salt, please?
I'm your friend.
Nothing lasts forever. Coffee is cold. Smoke is foul. Time passes and people change.
You are very clever!
Are you a little thirsty?
I didn't feel at all hungry.
Am I wrong?
Do you like to lose?
Are you crazy?
Tom wants to make a request.
It's going to rain tonight.
I just got out of school.
I disagree with you on this matter.
Are they busy?
Who helped?
Stay in the tank!
Hello, my name is Tom. What's your name?
Do you want to stay longer?
I plan to stay in Boston until October.
Tom felt better.
Tom doesn't care about people looking at him.
Tom can rest as much as he wants.
Go to where he lives!
Change your clothes!
You should see this.
Stay where he lives!
I can't read without subtitles.
I don't like swimming in this river.
Can you hear me well now?
I wish no one had seen us.
You haven't slept enough.
We're trying to help you.
You know that Tom likes beer.
I'm glad you were there.
Where are you going today?
You look like a Japanese.
Tom told me he left his keys at home.
Did you stop Tom?
No one was a fool.
What did you vote for Tom?
Open your mouths!
I want to try.
I'll show you how it's done.
My choice of words is my wife.
If I were you, I'd go home and get a good rest.
I didn't make your bed.
Tom doesn't seem to eat much.
They were not suspicious.
You are all filthy rags.
Sami is lost and wants to know where he is going.
You were joking.
You are all crazy.
Your parents love me very much.
Are you from Kyoto?
Don't wash here.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Have you ever played dead man's game with Tom?
I didn't know you didn't know how to do it.
Only Tom should know this.
No one can stop them!
I miss Paris very much.
I would have been in Australia if I had wanted to.
I have to learn how to defend myself.
We hate them all.
Have you ever eaten a peach?
He had not been dead for many days.
What are you going to do for Halloween?
Stop moving!
This is your slave, isn't it?
When did this start?
She worshipped him.
Let me explain that to him.
I can't decide for myself whether to walk or stay.
Mary knows exactly what she wants.
Try bringing a dog, cat or chicken.
I know you're here, Tom.
The Meutubian Revolution is a symbol of the struggle for freedom and human rights.
I came to see you.
Do you really want to go to Germany?
Sami is sick.
Tom is watching someone.
Tom cooked something for Mary.
I love you very much.
What if I ask a pointless question?
Where is my computer?
I'm not your servant!
Tom can speak French too.
Follow your sister's example.
You know I can't.
I'm afraid I'll have to talk to you again.
They live outside the city.
The food has arrived.
Why were you wearing a jacket?
God is.
Someone is watching you.
Tom put Mary to sleep.
How do I get to the train station?
I'll come and help you.
You should read this.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Who is this?
I'll buy it for you.
Tom took his brother.
I will be back tomorrow.
We saw them.
Are you hurt?
We have to do something.
You speak German well.
Talk to someone.
Let me know if there is any change.
They laughed.
Stop apologizing to me.
Who cheated?
Tom wrote me from Australia.
Tom held out his hand as he slammed the door.
When are you going?
What do you want to help me with?
I have another option.
It's work.
Who is speaking?
What makes you sad makes me sad too.
He wants more.
Tom cut his teeth.
No thank you, I don't drink coffee.
These are my books.
Tom turned around.
Someone called.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
No need to smoke!
Come on over here!
I give you a lot of money every month.
We all hate them.
Hurry home.
She helps him.
Get ready!
I hope no one saw you do it.
Someone killed Tom.
Tom and Mary shouldn't go to Boston.
Tom bought drinks for everyone in the bar.
Why do you want all these tips?
Tom isn't a good writer.
No one can forgive them.
Call me about your work.
Find someone else.
Is he dead?
Who remembers?
Come and dance!
Tom doesn't like it.
Tom doesn't understand very well.
Someone was killed.
I like macaroni.
Tom wants a favor from Mary.
What will you talk about then?
Someone has taken my place.
Sami pulled a bullet out of his arm.
Do you remember what Tom said?
Hurry up.
Tom married for money.
What did you see?
Tom's brother is a lawyer.
Have you ever driven in Australia?
Tom hasn't met Mary.
I know that Tom is a jerk.
Are you crazy?
Who is wrong?
Your hands are stained with blood.
Is there any?
There is no shame in being humiliated.
Tell him tomorrow.
I heard someone scream.
Who is injured?
He was up early.
Tell me how I can help you.
Tom's wedding is about to begin.
Tom knows what you're thinking.
São Paulo is the largest city in Brazil.
What is your father's name?
No one thinks he's a fool.
I'm missing someone.
Tom and Mary have nothing to eat.
Play there.
What brings you here?
They are all waiting.
Can you tell me what Tom did?
I want to know who they called.
Please say hello to your parents.
I'm not afraid of death.
Thank you for your help.
Don't you know how to break it?
The sheep says: I'm not smoking, but I'm running.
My mother was ill for two days.
Tom is hiding something.
Divide so that you can rule.
Would you like me to tell you what I did last summer in Boston?
The bank has put a negative price on the economic prospects of the future work.
Mary built it.
Go this way.
Hello, my lord!
Do you have a house in Australia?
You saw yourself in the mirror.
He kissed me from the neck down.
I'm not from Boston at all.
The best of the best is John Lennon of the Kabyles.
Don't answer Tom's request.
Someone was knocking.
I don't think Tom would agree to that.
When do you plan to leave?
Are you talking?
I lent him my car.
You are lying.
I want more money.
Keep going!
I'm glad to know you.
Someone started the fire.
Sami has made a new friend.
Is there someone to meet us?
I can drive.
Can you see?
They are chosen.
If you eat it, you will die.
I want to have someone to talk to.
Someone was watching us.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
I haven't forgotten about you all.
I want you to forgive me for everything I said.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Tom, Mary and John are all here.
They ran.
Tom is planning to return on October 20.
I heard someone scream.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since October.
Tom yelled at Mary.
No one went there.
We were both tired.
Can you split my sandwich in half?
I am ashamed of myself.
The dog is dying.
You are beautiful.
Do not move!
I know you'd be brave enough to do that.
Your word is your word.
Have you called him yet?
He who endures the ages regrets.
Someone is watching you.
Have you been here before?
Tom has come.
Answer my questions.
Someone's calling you.
Tom told me he waited thirty minutes.
I'll try again.
The dog said to the dog that was complaining about how he was not tired of eating: "How come you are hungry and I am drunk?"
Tom bought it for Mary.
I was ready for them.
I like to move.
Someone tried to kill you.
Who said that?
He won, I won't do it again.
This is Tom's idea.
I hope no one saw you do this.
The Chinese society is always wrong.
How long have you been wearing shoes?
They are rich.
Just go there.
This girl is poor.
I want to hold your hand.
Get out !
Stop the talk.
This is a tree.
Where is the nearest subway station?
I'll be back soon.
We will never stop learning.
This is a gift for you.
Stand up!
Sami followed Layla to her apartment.
Tom and Mary's parents are friends.
She won.
I have no other choice.
They won't come back.
He walks slowly.
I like this movie.
Read this now.
It snowed heavily.
Be clear.
Are you not sick?
A beer, please.
I trust you.
Who stopped?
Just let me go.
I work for Tom.
You have made me crazy!
Sami fought a lot.
I didn't want to wait so long.
Someone started a fire.
Tom has to go to school.
It's still better down there.
Someone was going to see us.
No one ate the record.
I am reading.
Did you work with him?
He doesn't want to go.
Tom said he might cry.
They all laughed.
Please call me tonight.
Sami and Farid were in prison together.
We did that on October 20th.
Help Tom to get up.
Tom knows he trusts you.
Prices have gone up.
I'm thinking Tom is an artist.
He can speak French.
Take this one.
How old are you?
I'm very busy.
Look at me!
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
It is difficult.
I'm sorry for that.
I will be in Australia until October 20.
Are you going to Copacabana today?
Please.
I saw Tom sitting at his desk, reading a book.
Tell them I'm here.
My new dress is yellow.
It is not in our hands.
Get out of the way.
You guys should be ashamed of yourselves.
Jim looks like his father.
Franz Kafka, in "The Lost Boys", or perhaps Woody Allen, said simply: "A journey is a long one... especially to the end".
I was so shocked when I opened the door!
A teaspoon, please.
I'll call you before I come.
I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
Tom can do that, can't he?
Leave him to us.
It would have been better if Tom had been fired last October.
What is your father's profession?
Sami saw him again.
I want to sit in the middle.
So, Tom is a tough guy?
I'm not tall.
You should be careful when crossing a bridge.
Say it again.
Today is a good day.
At first my father didn't care.
Can I ask a rude question?
The egg is good for you.
I'll tell you how to do it.
Have you seen a movie?
Peace in the world.
I want her to help me do that.
It is impossible!
Tom is going to Boston next month.
Have you ever been to New York?
That's not going to happen.
Tom said I couldn't come in.
Do you want white or red wine?
Someone forgot her umbrella.
Can you stop the noise?
Are you at home?
Don't call me from behind.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
Try this one.
The command is long.
I was wrong about you.
Eat all you want.
Tom is missing.
I was in Boston when it happened.
Have you read this?
You're behind Tom.
It looks like snow.
Make it so.
I think I'll want to do that.
You and I like games.
I wanted to marry Tom.
Men like to eat.
I haven't been there since October.
How did you find me?
Mr. Jones is here to see you.
I like to learn languages.
No one knows how to pronounce Tom's name.
She lied.
I think you did that without paying attention.
Can you pass the tea, please?
It's Monday.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice were born on October 20, 2013.
Sami broke into Layla's house.
You too.
Talk to someone.
Sami had been here five or six months.
Are you crazy?
Tom and I had lunch.
Someone broke my camera.
You recognize each other again.
Burn your room.
They are fighting each other every day.
Tom came to believe Mary.
She died.
They never said anything about that.
Tom and Mary hope no one has seen them.
"Tom told you"... "I don't care what Tom says".
You're up early.
Have you returned from Tibet?
I know that Tom isn't dead.
Tom wants us to buy books.
You are talking.
For what?
Tom apologized to Mary.
I was reading a book.
Tell me you've forgiven me.
I want you to come right now.
Wipe your tears.
Rima is a student.
How do you vent your anger?
Thank you for your offer.
I saw one.
Why are you reading this?
We are talking about Tom.
Can I have it?
There is no hope left.
I know you'll be brave for this.
Anza is the sound of a person crying at night in houses where people are being raped or brutally murdered.
Tom may know something.
I make coffee with milk.
I hope no one saw you.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
Tom seems to be telling the truth.
I know you're going to Boston in October.
I'm putting on my clothes.
Why didn't he answer my message?
I love you very much.
Are you sure you know what needs to be done?
Tom is fluent in French.
Tom kept crying.
Can you drink?
There was someone there.
How many Pawns have you added?
How foolish!
Please stop.
One red wine, please.
The lion said: "They have understood our message!
Somebody made a mistake.
Tom never left Australia.
We know that you didn't kill Tom.
Tom and Mary left about an hour ago.
I've made many mistakes in my life.
Speak up!
Tom understood.
When are you coming?
The milk is hot.
It is good!
Tom went to Boston to look for work.
You're here to help your father.
Two years of waiting is too long.
I'm glad to see you too.
Why did Tom hire us?
Do Tom and Mary teach French?
Why are you chasing all these dogs?
Follow me.
I'm learning French.
These people will get better.
You won.
Hurry up!
Right there!
Excuse me, where are you from?
What do you give your dog to eat?

Tom is stuck in Australia.
I hope Tom doesn't tell me to do this.
Which one of them do you like?
Look at this!
Tom met many other artists while he was in Boston.
Tom washed his car this morning.
I went to a Halloween party dressed as a vampire.
He's been here a long time.
Leave Tom to himself.
Tom wants to call Mary.
I can't see her.
I see the world differently now.
I see a book.
Have you read this?
I don't understand how you feel.
Rajju is already here.
I don't have a sister below me.
Tom and Mary understood why they were there.
You have two faces.
I studied art history.
Stand there!
Maybe we should tell someone.
He was totally unaware of the danger he faced.
I'll write you when I'm bored.
I'm locked up.
We know that you lied to Tom.
You'll think about that.
It is good.
How many houses are there in Hend?
Tom can't find Mary.
Tom writes smartly.
You hit me!
Tom kissed me.
Did anyone see anything?
Believe me, you know!
You are not being polite.
Can you help me translate this into French?
I want to walk with you.
We walk together until the next station.
Sami called his mother.
Someone is trying to kill me.
Tom started dating Mary.
Someone stole my purse.
Did he say anything to you about this?
Can you help me translate this into French?
Tom is starting.
I'm going to swim with you.
Please speak slowly.
Please come in!
Tom wanted to kiss Mary.
Tom sent you something.
We are sorry.
I'm here to do better than that.
I was studying French when you read yesterday.
Get out now.
She says.
You don't seem to be a problem.
It really hurt my feelings.
There is no internet connection.
This car is behind us.
You can come in.
Tom helped out.
Please excuse me.
Someone has died.
Are you all so stupid?
Give it to me.
I need to talk to someone.
I have one thing to give you.
Someone poisoned them.
Are you ready?
Tom missed them.
Don't come into my room without a ladder.
I'm glad to hear your letter.
I'll show you how it's done.
If you want to go, go now!
Thank you, I understand now.
It is a stone, Tom.
You're not Japanese.
If she can grow up, if she can learn.
Stop singing.
Do not wait.
Be patient with him.
Choose the flowers you like.
Please save me.
Someday someone will win.
Have you prayed?
Are you new?
If only Mary were here to help us.
You speak.
Where did I leave their mother?
Have a good day!
Tom doesn't look happy.
Did you pay?
I can't do what I want.
I can't defend you.
Sami's friend died.
Why did you buy it?
Please pass me some sugar.
Squeeze the milk.
We were waiting for them.
We wrote to them.
Keep going.
I need someone to talk to.
You are walking fast!
We caught three robbers.
He was afraid of him.
Tom swore to Mary that he didn't steal her chain.
I miss you very much.
Tom never told Mary that he was sorry.
Do not speak!
Tom is in seventh heaven.
They did a lot of things for me.
You'd better not spend a lot of money on this.
Say it again!
Where is the car?
I'll tell them about that.
Tom knows that Mary is following him.
Hurry up!
This is not Australia.
We haven't found the right solution yet.
I don't understand them.
I regret not telling Tom the truth.
Yes, please.
He is gone.
Keep working.
You are robbing your country.
Sami drank Layla's drinks.
Have you eaten?
I need to talk to someone.
They were eating.
Tom was doing nothing.
No one is dead.
Follow my advice.
They all sing.
What else do you want to buy?
I'm not your friend.
I think Tom is ready.
Take some rest.
Tom really loves you.
They want you dead.
I am a Muslim who believes in Jesus. Is there a problem?
You should always have a dictionary on hand.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
Be brave and be a mother.
I can run.
I know whose book this is.
There are some boxes on the top of the board.
Have you decided what to get Tom for his birthday?
You look sweet.
He walks fast.
Are there no questions?
I told them not to tell you.
There is something smelling.
Follow your sister's path.
I tried very hard.
Stop looking!
Tom's room is full every day.
Keep singing!
You're driving me crazy!
I will be in Australia until October 20th.
Listen to this!
We can work on that now.
Get ready quickly.
I need to eat now.
I'm not going to break anything.
Tom gave me some books.
I'm sorry you lost.
It's going to be windy.
Put them up.
Someone is watching you.
It's a pity that you can't come.
Be thankful for him.
Tom lent Mary $300 dollars.
I don't know who can swim and who can't.
They left before yesterday.
Tom said he'd never heard Mary sing.
Nothing has changed.
Let him live as he pleases.
Please lend me your car.
I did that.
Please, if you can.
How did they find out about Tom?
My uncle visited me every three days.
Tom didn't kiss Mary.
Try to surprise him.
Do we really have to go back?
The road is empty.
The other day I was alone.
Tom should have bought Mary flowers.
Tom followed Mary to the house.
Tom will be buried on October 20.
Tom won't let you go.
Everything has a price.
Why do people go to the movies?
Why don't you listen to me?
I bought an old car.
It hurts!
No one understood me.
Shut up Tom!
Are you an artist?
Are you drunk?
Tom has come.
Tom has outgrown his dream.
Nothing has happened.
Go somewhere where no one knows you.
I don't like large dogs.
Is there anyone you want to meet?
I don't use a computer every day.
Tom can steal food.
Play!
I want to be a writer.
Pull him up!
Tom tried to resurrect Mary.
Tom is a singer.
It's better if you don't eat too much.
I am a Kabyle.
There is one in the house.
I am not a student.
Tom said he wanted to stop smoking.
Someone just called.
Tom didn't see it.
What are you waiting for?
I want someone to help me do this.
Tom and his wife broke up.
The bear is honored.
I like to watch westerns.
I can't see well enough.
He will come to you tomorrow.
Tom is playing.
Are you in Australia?
I hope no one followed you.
Aren't you ashamed?
Who?
Shut up!
Tom always speaks French with me.
I have a story to write.
I know some of the boys.
Is it okay if I take a break?
He wasn't ready to see her.
I disagree with you on this matter.
Smile, please!
I will pay.
Tom tried to swim across the river.
Are you kidding?
Go to the house.
He needs a lot of skill to become a teacher!
Why did they send you back?
What's your name?
I'm planning to do that today.
All my troubles are over.
I sent her home.
I like it.
I heard someone whistling.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
Where is Wagadugu?
Someone is watching you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
Are you engaged to Tom?
How are you?
Why didn't you call Tom and remind him?
Someone spoke to Tom.
Please tell Tom to come in.
They all love you.
Can I ask you a simple question?
According to science, man evolved from a rock.
Tom is not a reliable witness.
Don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.
Tom was being greeted by Mary.
Do something!
I was given a free copy of the books.
She went to swim in the river.
I think you should read this book.
Why are you afraid?
These are new.
Can someone help me?
Someone is watching us.
It's wise to continue working in a place like this.
Tom isn't dead yet.
So, we'll tie the rope over the mountain.
Someone read it to Tom.
Whose is this neighbor?
I'm going to eat now.
Tom bought me a ticket.
Tom became angry again.
Give me the different one.
She disappeared.
Why didn't you tell me you were going to Australia?
You are talking.
Did they blow them up?
I walked with my dog.
I saw someone kissing Tom.
Maybe we should tell someone.
The youth of today are very tough.
Please don't be angry with me.
Someone's calling for you.
He doesn't know what to do now.
Do you have any questions?
You are a monster!
Please stand aside.
Shut up!
What is it?
I should have known.
Don't eat it.
What do you give your dog to eat?
Tom has until October 20 to make up his mind.
I was fired from my job.
Take me home now.
You should see his movie.
You are all dead.
The salt.
Tom is the tallest in his class.
How are you all?
She is a virgin.
You may have done this with us.
Eat your soup, John!
Tom doesn't tell the truth every day.
You'd think you were just trying to steal my sword.
I left Australia on October twelfth.
I wonder how anyone would want to touch that.
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
You are fools to continue working in a place like this.
They stole my money.
I know that Tom is very busy.
They are.
What can you give us, Tom?
I remember doing it again.
I'm hoping he will come.
No one can swim.
I'm keeping it.
Drink some water.
Can anyone help?
You listen carefully.
That's right, son, the rest is what it says.
I wonder if Tom has a rope helmet.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Tom said he didn't mean to sing.
I like her very much.
Thank you for decorating my house.
I wish I was a clown again.
Give me work while I'm hot.
What did you think of her new novel?
I could be stopped.
Are you Russian?
Tom said he's never eaten Thai food.
Tom said he had a day off.
Friedrich Nietsche was a German philosopher.
Do you know how to memorize?
You are all crazy.
When did Tom get here?
What did you put in the box?
He became very famous.
I called security.
You danced.
Tom hurt Mary.
This house is small.
We're not ready to beg now.
Get out of here!
Whose idea was this?
I gave him a dog to eat.
Have some coffee.
I hope you understand.
How did you find me?
I saw that the problem would be solved.
"Where will our Kaboul come from?" "It will be for this!"
She's got the computers.
I have nothing to fear.
I'm not trying to stop you.
I want to know what you all did.
Did something happen?
I feel something.
Do you have a dog?
Can you speak more quietly, please?
Someone wants to talk to you.
Get him!
Are you here?
Tom lied.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia right now.
I'm not so bad as to be seen!
Tom said he wasn't alone.
Add this water.
Thank you!
Someone is watching Tom.
I like the light of cups.
Do you like Italian?
Did you find your letters?
I don't like you anymore.
I saw a dog.
What do they call this fruit?
What is my dream?
I won't forget all this.
I hope no one saw you come here.
I'm sorry about that.
When did you start doing this?
I'm going to stop working.
He finished.
Tom said I had to memorize French.
He couldn't finish his dinner.
You have to go back.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't pregnant.
Tom wrote a letter to Mary.
I just can't take it anymore.
Hamed is a miser.
A cup of tea, please.
Do you write in French?
Call me if anything changes.
Get away from me!
Have you seen Tom yet?
They're playing football tomorrow.
This is John.
How strong you are!
Tom is drowsy.
Go ahead !
The second thing happened that they did not build on.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Monday comes after Sunday.
You will be in Boston in October.
Did you see that smile?
Will you remember me?
You are right.
You speak too fast.
Are you hungry?
Has anyone left?
He came here.
Jeff had drunk himself yesterday.
I'm tired of my work.
Tom likes art.
There is someone wandering.
You never told me you knew Tom.
Monday comes after Sunday.
I'm not your maid!
Why doesn't Tom want to stay?
What's your name on Skype?
Someone broke this box.
Play!
Follow your foot!
Food is cheap at that restaurant.
I'm almost dead.
I hate to lose.
Shut him up.
You are ill.
You should write a novel.
The passing one is mistaken.
I see.
Who went with you?
Both locals and tourists know each other.
Sit here.
Please help me.
You'd better cut your hair.
Tom bought Mary cocaine.
We have lemonade on the outside.
Be sure you know what needs to be done.
I'm going to stay in Australia now.
Tom went home with Mary.
He cut the bottom of my pants.
You are lying.
Tom and Mary are about to return.
I wonder if I like you very much or if I just like you there.
Snow covered the entire city.
Give me all the money.
We found him alive.
Where are you?
The one who touched my hand, blinded me.
Someone wants to send a letter.
Did you see his face?
I want you to get involved.
You will find someone.
You are a bunch of assholes.
I was preparing them.
Did you make a mistake, Tom?
You can drive if you want.
They are joking.
Read it!
You found me awake.
Someone has to do something.
I want to eat something.
Tom is used to drinking beer.
It smells bad.
Did you eat anything last night?
Don't leave your things here.
Tom needed someone to help him.
You are back.
Tom said he's never had sushi.
Someone is singing.
Is she coming?
Someone must have stopped us.
You were chosen.
I will teach Spanish in my country.
We could be seen by anyone.
I don't miss Boston at all.
Are these your books or mine?
Tom didn't think Mary loved him at all.
That's what you need.
Bring me my keys.
Blow it out!
Take this one.
Tom just texted me.
Choose carefully.
You can go home now.
Follow me.
I forgot not to feed my dog.
You're a disaster in the kitchen.
It is scary!
I live in Yerevan.
There's nothing here.
I know you'll find a way to do it.
Tom can swim.
Don't be afraid to dance.
They agreed.
Stop crying!
Someone is watching Tom.
Put on your clothes!
My hand is hurting.
Do you go swimming in the winter?
Tom will never forget Mary.
Please don't forget to say goodbye to your family.
You are lying.
They shook hands.
Tom misses Mary.
They died.
You can read this book.
I asked him to go with me, and he agreed.
Are you afraid?
I let Tom kiss me.
Let the water run.
Are you Americans?
You don't know what true love is.
They're mocking you.
Go around.
Get up!
Tom plays the guitar.
The prospect of life is both exciting and frightening.
There is a listener.
Have you seen the new movie?
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
It's far away!
Are these your fingers?
Could someone catch us?
That's all.
Are you lying?
Tom is thinking.
Reading improves your intelligence.
You might want to stop.
Have you ever been to New York?
Tom said that Mary seemed scared.
You found us.
What do you think, will snow be nice?
Get some help.
Is there anything that can't be done?
Tom isn't as good as his brother.
Look behind you.
Open the safe with this key.
I didn't leave her alone.
What is a computer?
Why do you want a horse?
Is it famous?
Did you know Mary before she joined the band?
Get to know yourself!
Someone broke this box.
No one went there.
Tom and I are just friends.
Are you lying to me?
A book cannot read itself.
Please teach me how to swear in French.
I already told Tom I didn't want to do that.
Tom and I will always be friends.
Is it French?
She prayed.
How salty!
Would you like some food?
I really love you.
Stop the carrot.
Try to calm him down.
One for you and one for me.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
I'm tired of reading.
How many books have you read?
This is the story.
Tom is scared.
How long?
Someone is singing.
Open your mouth!
How do you spend your time in Boston?
Where did you leave them?
Watch the television.
Do you need food?
Make yourself at home.
Tom can't remember where he hid the map.
Take care of yourselves.
There is silence in the forest.
I can eat whenever I want.
Tom and I were born on the same day.
Mr. Tanaka called while you were away.
Are your parents still alive?
I just can't sleep.
It is crazy.
We were all dancing.
We are talking.
Tom kissed Mary.
I made a big mistake.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tell me about the death of the chickens.
He knows ten languages.
Sami hasn't played this game.
Tom built a big house.
Tom thought he was the best of them all.
I'm always proud of you.
I can't speak any other language.
Tom never had any trouble with anyone.
Hello to everyone.
Tom doesn't know that Mary did it.
He is a boy with many dreams.
Tom is angry.
He is just a jerk.
Why aren't you paying attention?
All the students in the class were laughing at Tom's new suit.
Sami doesn't know how to get along with people.
Call me when you get there.
Why didn't Tom ask someone else to do that?
I have plenty of food.
Snow brings in grain.
Tom has changed.
Tom's face is yellow.
You still don't understand.
Be careful!
That day is coming soon.
Holidays
Your cheese is fresh.
How have you been spending your weekend so far?
Have another.
Tom met Mary at the Halloween party.
Get up!
I want to see your sister.
Tom bought it for Mary.
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Tom encouraged me.
Tom has fled to Australia.
Can you lend me some money?
You're a good writer.
The clothes.
Julia is singing.
It's a mess!
Is there anyone?
Sami was a poor man in a small town.
Tom didn't do what he wanted to do.
Someone saw you.
You are very different from us.
You love me!
Get back there!
He who rejects the tree does not grow.
Mr. Sakaki is here to see you.
Tom started studying then.
Is there a problem?
Tom was not in favor of it.
Do you turn on the TV every day?
I like to joke.
Please hit slowly.
Can you come?
I will do everything I can for you.
We want everyone to be concerned about their own heads, hair, and nails, so no one has to worry about the competition. Whoever wants it, let him have it. Whoever wants your coat and shirt, let him have his shirt.
I'm reading the book.
I need you to do one thing.
Are you going to leave me?
Tom said he had to borrow money.
Hurry up now.
Tom told me that I was pretty.
You are at home.
You're lost.
Who is she then?
Can I have some coffee, please?
Please answer.
This room holds 5,000 people.
A pine tree cut the road.
Tom's father abandoned his family.
Did someone call you?
Is it windy today?
I didn't want to wait that long.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
Tom isn't going to Boston until October.
Have you been here before?
Are you safe?
I already told Tom that he had to do it.
May I say something?
We may need them.
Which is the truth?
Someone has been knocking.
Would you make her a sandwich?
Which neighbor do you see?
Can anyone help me?
I gave him the little money I had.
Help me out!
Someone is watching Tom.
A goat is a poor man's cow.
Do you like Italian?
It's good to see you again.
Fish.
Go ahead again!
The other side is the other, as the ancients say.
There was a fire in the house.
I asked Tom why I wasn't there.
Tom looked at Mary.
Today is the second meeting in October.
Tom said he could help us do that.
Which one do you like?
When did you go to Boston?
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the party?
I came alone.
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the party?
Are they new?
You are my only hope.
Do not move!
Take care of yourselves.
Tom said that Mary wasn't very good at listening.
They made French bread.
I never needed this much money.
They waited.
You should talk to Tom.
Tom went back to the garden and walked around.
Tom is calling to say he won't come.
I need to talk to someone.
Are you kidding?
You are tired of working in a place like this.
Are you Russians?
I'm going back to Boston on October 20th.
You are taller than me.
I felt happy.
When did she get her car?
You sit here.
Tom is pissed.
What is your friend's name?
How did Tom get to Australia?
Who did you shoot the movie "The Witches" with?

I love my Kabyle culture.
Is there one?
Can you speak French too?
You are fast.

Come and dance!
I'm afraid we have to leave if we want to be home before dark.
They're still following us.
Be careful!
We all miss you.
You can go home now.
Praise God.
This is my opinion, not yours.
I'll get you out of there.
Everyone is from Australia.
They don't all know the root has a root, so that the light shines behind the root.
Someone is eating.
I thought someone had died.
What is a date?
No one ever listens.
Who is the shooter?
Tom kissed Mary.
Do you want to lose weight?
Tom is dancing.
He told me to come early.
You fools!
This took me many hours.
It must be over.
Stop looking!
Stay here and wait until Tom comes.
Tom is a real man.
Please don't leave me and Tom here.
You don't know who we're going to meet.
Do you remember what Tom said?
Show me your papers!
How long have you been in Boston?
There was someone outside.
I don't think I like Boston.
My doctor is very rude.
I told Tom why I was in the hospital.
Go and lie down.
I like insects.
Someone is watching.
I'm glad to see you again.
Naomi moved her bag from one side to the other.
You are getting close.
I'm a friend of his brother.

Why did you come to me?
Greetings to you all.
I'm not different.
Is this your book?
We are happy.

Please add some milk to my coffee.
He believes everything I say.
She wants it.
When will you eat?
Are you married?
I guess I'm just tired.
You are a good student.
Please read it again.
Tom bought drinks for everyone in the bar.
Hello, my dear.
Please come in.
Have you seen my sister?
Did anyone tell him?
I want to have someone to talk to.
Why are you telling me these meaningless words?
Red is better.
You can get your money back if you want.
You are very brave.
Don't be a two-faced man.
When I went to Boston, I was about thirty years old.
Someone is waiting for Tom.
You guys are crazy.
There they are, tell me.
I promised myself I would never go back there.
What did you see that was missing?
Someone else may have been hurt.

We need someone.
You are the ones who are lying. I am not.
The book is expensive.
Where is your son?

Have you seen the queen?
This book is not Tom's.
I don't know who you want to see.
Follow your dreams.
Tom spoke to Mary last night.
There may be other reasons.
Someone stole my food.
Let me go!
They all agreed.
Be strong!
Just look at my new car.
It's still warm.
My son went to Japan.
Did you ever speak French with Tom?
Are you going to give this to Tom?
They mock others every day.
Where is your God now?
Sami started to lose his mind.
Tom likes to read.
The house!
Tom yelled at Mary.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia right now.
He read it to his sister.
God knows.
We talked.
Are you Tom?
No one understands you.
Tom likes to sing.
I hope someone else does that now.
Tom might be able to help you on Christmas Day.
My dog is asleep.
You should get used to it.
All my friends have one.
However, this virus that may have caused the CoVid19 virus, because we did not build on it, has passed us by.
We bought this from Australia.
Get out now.
Look at the road.
You told them a story.
Can you talk or not?
Do you know anyone named Mr. Green?
Get out of here!
Tom bought something for Mary.
No one understands Omar's rhetoric.
Have you read this?
You found them.
Call me tomorrow.
A bird that is tied cannot fly.
Wait for him.
Choose wisely.
Is he white?
Did God really call Muslims to kill non-Muslims?
She has a gold-plated card.
Tom may have seen something.
Who ran away?
Tom looks very frightened.
Tom lied.
Where were you this morning?
Did you call to see?
Lidia, can you cook something for Magdalena, Ania, Piotr and Lech?
Tom killed someone.
I'm not lying. You are.
Did you get some sleep?
I like art.
I am not your love.
Be a good man!
I'll get you some friends who speak German.
Pay attention to your behavior.
I am very happy for you.
They all speak English.
Get to know each other!
My garden is small.
He found them.
This is not enough.
You came to Tom's rescue.
Don't give it a second thought.
Peter bought a cat.
What were you reading to her?
Did you come back from Tibet?
What did you say to Tom?
Tom wore his Halloween costume to school.
They all died.
Are you waiting for someone?
Someone is wandering.
The woman said, "Let me go, jungle, I'm leaving you a snack".
This lion was born in prisons.
Tom started work on October 20th.
We were waiting for them.
Don't tell anyone.
You are talking.
Someone started the fire.
Open your books!
I think I'll start with a beer.
Tom knows that Mary has gone to Boston.
Put your clothes on!
There is nothing in his possession.
The cup is empty.
Come by tomorrow.
Praise is jealousy.
I don't think Tom speaks French every day.
Take care of yourself.
Get up early, you'll find your place.
What are you wearing?
Someone has done it before.
Do it now.
Have you had lunch?
Do you remember what Tom said?
I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
I'm not breaking anything.
You're taller than him.
Thank you for your encouragement.
To learn a language, you must know the vocabulary.
Get up!
Who heard?
He didn't think Mary and Tom would stay together.
Someone stole my money.
I'm surprised to see you.
Help him.
Tom is rested.
Stay with me.
Please answer.
Every morning I ask myself why.
Here, I'm watching the TV...
There must be someone who can do something.
Have you finished your work?
Could you please leave us alone for just a minute?
You are lying.
His head is full of problems.
It's not a right wing, it's not a left wing. I'm a bird.
She already knows the answer.
What do you like? What don't you like?
Who are you?
Where are we going? What did you see?
Where is your grandson?
Tom will follow Mary.
That's it!
Try to find a cure.
Let me go!
Tom is already on the bus.
You don't seem to be a problem.
Can I go home now?
Tom shook his head.
When are you coming to Algeria?
I heard him whispering, his brother was not talking.
You are lying.
Tom will never believe me again.
What is considered beautiful in one language may not be so in another.
Has anyone been hurt?
It is snowing.
I like to eat out.
Someone stole my passport.
Tom is back.
We found Mary.
Who found this book?
Italian is a beautiful language, which produces music in a natural way.
Is that Tom's car?
Tom thinks a lot about Mary.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
Tofu is very good with sake.
Why do you think that?
Tom got Mary into the Church of Satan.
Tom is a jerk.
She may be gone.
How can you love a girl who's not obviously okay?
She took water from the well.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Someone stole my food.
Sami sat in the high chair.
Tom and I broke up.
Have courage!
I wish I could stay alone.
I'm not washing your car.
She had always thought him handsome.
You can change that if you want.
Stop lying about me.
Is Muhammad a true prophet or not?
Who is there?
Have you gone mad?
Tom's happiness was short-lived.
Tom lost everything.
Water, please.
I need someone to talk to.
Tom knows how to speak in public.
I was just joking with her.
I don't like to play baseball.
I'm going to quit my job in October.
They have a lot of money.
Tell everyone.
Do you have a problem?
Tom is dying.
Tom was last seen on October 20 in Boston.
Tom is a hopeful man.
I am glad to see you again.
Stop my crying.
You and I like games.
I felt as if someone had cheated on me.
She loves him.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I can teach you to cook.
Where did you eat so early?
Tom needs to talk to someone.
Tom is my real friend.
It was snowing.
Mary was a bit of a jerk.
Alice is sleeping in her room.
Tom called.
Get out of here!
Is this dress any good?
Smile with me.
They're yours.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom cheated on Mary.
Please call him.
Sami and Layla were all fighting.
Do you want to read something?
I was at the door for Tom.
Is there anything you want to read?
Tom wore a Halloween costume.
I kissed her so hard she came out.
I needed to learn how to defend myself.
We all know how to speak French.
He plays guitar well.
Do you want your wife to speak in Esperanto?
He bought his sister.
Someone is following us.
There's always someone there.
Can you get him to her?
I left you some messages.
Who owns this truck?
I'm not sure today is tomorrow.
You can't drive.
Someone is sleeping here.
You've already paid.
Australia was one of the only countries I visited last year.
It's really funny.
Tom sent you something.
Is there anything you want?
Show me your papers!
Go and change your clothes.
Is it October already?
You are a fool!
We are brothers.
Be nice to people.
Please, who can open the door?
I live in Azerbaijan.
What did you do today?
Are you crazy?
I'm crazy about you.
My uncle reads to me every three days.
This book is heavy.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Are you dead?
Tom said that we should wait here.
Leave her to us.
He was disappointed that he wasn't invited.
I'm very happy for your sake.
Tom walked up to Mary.
Choose one.
Your time has come!
She is talking.
Are you Canadian?
You guys! Who do you think they're going to electrocute? I don't see!
Mary helped Tom.
No one can do it!
Some plants are cold-resistant.
I sing every day.
I spent the day by the sea.
You can have whatever you want.
She is here!
Obey your teachers.
Tom is a respected man.
Everyone should leave his trust to himself.
I know Tom's secret.
Are you crazy?
Art is dead.
Aren't you Tom's friends?
He smiled.
This is for you.
Are you human?
Are you happy with this one?
I called for help.
You like to dance.
Tom believes Mary.
It is a defense.
A sick person's or a person's illness is called a wakefulness.
I think so.
You'll be surprised what Tom drinks and beer when he gets out.
Are you waiting for someone?
Are you angry?
Please, forget this matter.
Tom seems busy this morning.
Follow me.
Take it easy, Tom. You're in a bad mood.
I want you to try this.
Someone stole it from me.
Are you in a hurry to eat it all?
Tom died on October 20, 2013.
Sami is scared too.
Look how good you are!
Are you going to swim?
Someone stole my food.
Forget about it.
Will you sell your house to Tom?
I like games.
I don't want to tell Tom what happened.
Look over there.
Tom emigrated to Australia.
Mary was surprised by Tom's answer.
She knows the truth.
I didn't recognize him.
I won't even do that.
Tom was jealous of Mary.
Is the wine good?
He's going to kill me.
No one has sent me a letter.
I have a good idea.
I cannot defend you.
Are they ready or not yet?
Who went with you?
Tom wants to make a lot of money fast.
Nothing has changed.
I have to meet Tom.
Watch out for something.
I'll take Tom's place.
Is this paper?
I'm at home.
You can also go home now.
Where are your sisters?
To be honest, I didn't do what Tom said I would do.
Today is a headache!
Everyone paid for themselves.
Read it again.
Someone was going to pay.
Keep writing.
I don't need your grief.
Have the children eaten yet?
He is crying.
Why do you need a sword?
Tom is currently living in Australia.
I am a nurse.
It's the wind.
Tom and Mary are smiling.
Tom is asleep.
How can you be proud of a man like that?
You're a jerk where I live.
Tom is tired.
Are guns fired in Australia?
Someone will pay.
Tom forgot how beautiful she is.
We need to find someone who can help us.
He went off the highway.
He is tired.
She likes to fish.
Someone is cheating on Tom.
I refuse to grow up.
We were both tired.
Spring has arrived.
Is there anyone you want to see?
Tom took Mary's car keys because she was drunk.
You can't drink here.
Have a car!
Sami and Layla have been together for years.
She kissed him twice.
I agree.
His idea is better than yours.
Get up!
I hate computers.
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
It was their idea.
They were worried about Sofia.
Are you finished?
She stopped him.
Where is the door?
Help us out.
Sami didn't look at me at all.
We have a guide.
Hit him!
Where did Tom learn French?
He was sitting reading a book.
There was someone eating.
Can you give Tom and me a minute?
Layla was dating a bad boy.
You can't prove anything.
Mary came in.
Stop complaining!
Tom can't solve the problem by himself.
Sami doesn't know who Layla is.
How many books do you have?
You are stupid.
Nothing has happened.
He is a fool.
Keep reading.
He went to Spain.
We asked for 40 seconds ago.
Where is your son?
Tom complained.
They didn't say anything.
Someone has problems.
Please be quiet!
You should eat something.
This is a total asshole. And he's the president.
I read books.
Forget about Tom!
You're better than Tom.
I ate it.
Come to the house.
You should ask Alex.
I like to swim.
Please help me!
Once again I will not accept your mistakes.
Tom walked with Mary.
How much can you pay for this?
Why are you afraid?
You are ready to leave.
Mary is as old as Tom.
Come to my room.
I have to do that now.
Let the water run.
We are in spring.
The contract expires on October 20.
Did she use it?
Father, give us a bucket!
Help us out.
I'm surprised to see you.
You continued to talk.
Does Australia have four seasons?
I don't think Tom saw it.
Tom was overcome by the storm.
It is old.
I left Australia on October 20.
Did you eat your snacks?
I see how you're reading.
Tom is afraid of his father.
Give me the chain!
Hello, this is Nancy.
I was out.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
I'll wash my clothes tomorrow.
They still don't know how to pronounce Tom's name.
Get out of here!
I don't usually come to Boston in October.
Sami didn't stop.
She is afraid.
You are a thing.
Hamed is full of jealousy.
Did anyone see anything?
Someone's calling for you.
I need someone to help me.
Just be patient, old woman, he will soon catch up.
Are you Chinese?
The two met in October in Boston.
Uli Rohde, a beautiful German woman, sang a love song in Kabyle in the Kingdom of Kabylie.
Have you put everything in?
Someone has to do it.
Latin is a dead language.
Only Tom should know about this.
You're a winner.
How do you feel about yourself?
You look ill.
I will do that, of course.
Tom and Mary seem to be close friends.
It is impossible.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
I have money.
I love her, and she loves me.
Sami and Layla finally went to the party together.
Love is making you blind.
You are very lucky!
We know.
I know her.
Tom was robbed.
A black cat is eating a white rat.
I'm going to go.
Wash your clothes!
Someone shouted.
She bought a bottle of water.
They called.
We'll ask him for something else.
Are you guys crazy?
What is your favorite team?
Follow your sister's example.
It's near my bedroom.
You still don't understand.
Dinner is served!
I asked Tom to leave immediately.
Tom can't reach Mary.
Can you show me a picture, please?
Sami left his shelter and his protection there.
Are you kidding me?
Is that Japanese?
Do you know anything?
I need you here tomorrow.
Mary is waiting.
Tom seems sad.
Tom twisted his arm.
God is.
Tom has returned from Australia.
Forget about Tom.
We talked about Australia.
Tom said he couldn't eat any more.
He is not a boy.
Someone has already done it.
I don't want to live with you.
I speak some French.
Tom told Mary that he had made a promise.
I have visited many Asian countries.
My garden is small.
I would die for you.
Your work is limited to one thing.
Hit Tom.
Your work is limited to one thing.
By Uber.
These books aren't Tom's.
I want to eat with you.
Take a little rest.
Give it to whoever you want.
Can you take care of Tom?
What did your mother say?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
I'm going to eat a banana.
You are not joking.
Tom wants to marry me.
I didn't sleep until the sun was up.
Tom thought that the grass would one day protect him from the weeds.
She knows how to live.
I was very nervous in October.
Can you help me, please?
Go and get cleaned up.
Sami is a very difficult person.
The teacher looked in my bag.
I want this book, please.
I like funny stories.
I am a human being.
It's our turn!
Can this happen in Australia?
Call Tom.
October is only three months away.
You are happy.
It is a death.
Don't joke with me, Tom.
I'm not a person who cheats.
I was at your wedding.
What's the point of it if someone sees it?
The seeker finds.
There's nothing you can do to help.
Sami knows his limits.
Just let me see it.
I don't know why I'm laughing.
He looks good.
I'm not your maid!
Do you drink a lot?
Someone came.
This is a word, this is a curse.
Are you still at school?
You are part of the problem.
Someone wants to warn you.
We'll discuss this problem in the third section.
My name is Jack.
Please help us.
Tom can't seem to get away.
Tom wants to make a lot of money quickly.
The streets are empty.
It's better if I tell him.
If you don't want to do it, don't!
The baby with foot disease was closely monitored by doctors.
What a mess!
I like to write texts in my own language.
I hate to work.
Leave him to you!
Save yourself!
No one can find him.
Don't you have to work tomorrow?
There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics.
Please stop!
I want to know what you all did.
Help me clean the garage.
Do you see your table?
Tom said he'd be leaving tomorrow.
I'm happy for your success.
I'll see you in October.
It turned out that I had a brother.
I'll rent this place without having to drop anything.
Keep yourself cool.
I forgot your number.
Are you sleeping?
I am starting a new life.
I was already thinking about you.
I like to eat pizza.
He who can bring down mountains can make mountains.
Tom was talking about Mary.
No one knows why.
We just finished eating.
Are you worried?
Do not go!
Be careful.
Someone is sleeping here.
You'll find Tom is intelligent.
We only did it once.
I know French.
You have a fever.
Does this make you happy?
You don't have to be so scared.
Someone's calling you.
I want to surprise everyone.
Is that Tom's watch you found?
Read your book.
See you later, mother.
Tom said he had a day off.
You little shit!
You are a good student.
Someone broke this plate.
I'm afraid I'll have to talk to you again.
I won't be alone.
Find another one.
Tom started laughing.
Which writer do you like?
I already know Tom.
Let her go.
She built it.
Do you want to tell him?
Whose boat is this?
I'll try to help you.
No one is listening.
I want to learn Esperanto.
Please help me.
No one cared.
Who am I speaking to?
I'll like Tom.
My brothers!
I want a new dress.
Tom likes good readings.
This is from Australia.
Tom has stopped smoking.
Someone needs to stop Tom.
Get together.
What kind of girls do you like?
Your time has come!
Try to hurry Tom.
Why didn't you take her home?
She was angry.
Did you get Tom a birthday present?
Construction should begin in October.
Tom gets angry sometimes.
Can you make it quiet?
Are you sick?
Listen to me!
Do not speak!
I think like you.
There is nothing.
Has anyone ever been in a relationship with a vampire?
The sun is coming up.
Do you have any rice?
He loves himself.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't do that again.
Tom is bored.
Tom gets to know Mary a little bit.
How much bread have you eaten?
This boy is clean.
French is hard to understand.
I think there's someone in the front room.
It's finally snowing.
He refused to believe her.
Whose is this neighbor?
You're good at playing the guitar.
I am very happy for you.
I need the truth.
This house is very small.
Don't forget your money.
Spend your vacation days.
Tom is a jerk.
There is someone watching.
Save him.
It might be true.
Every question has a answer.
Tom will show you how to do it if you ask him.
Stop the whining!
How many of us will be there?
A friend of mine called me last night.
Tom ran outside to see what had happened.
I saw someone kiss Tom.
You can read this book.
Tom loves you.
You should be careful with your behavior.
Someone is or was here.
Are you here alone?
Close your eyes.
Who said that?
It's good for you.
We work with what we have.
They don't want me to buy them anything to drink.
I haven't said anything yet.
Teaching English is my job.
Tell them I'm here.
I think he ate his papers.
I need someone to help me.
I made a commitment to tell the truth.
Layla heard a noise outside.
When he was young, he would have liked Sami.
Do Mary and Tom understand French?
Are you at home?
Where are you from?
Someone is waiting for Tom.
They will do what I tell them.
I don't want Tom to stay.
Who said that?
Is this the first one?
You're all alone.
My wife has a lot of work to do.
I don't have to say anything.
There is no need to smoke.
You have a very beautiful smile.
Do not say anything.
Tom isn't like that.
Why aren't we going home?
I want someone to talk to.
I did nothing.
Sami saw the video.
I'm at the door on the right.
Remember last year.
Tom is bleeding.
Let's go and dance.
Someone has to do it.
To your health and better days ahead!
You can have whatever you want.
Take care of yourself!
I love you very much.
Tom is working for Mary.
This is a gift for you.
Just take me home.
I think Tom deserves that.
Tom Jackson is a writer I love very much.
I wanted to kill you.
No one knows who killed Tom.
Ask about it!
Forget English.
Tom collects old things.
No one heard the speech.
I'll take this one.
You've already paid.
Tom missed you.
Look at you.
I think he didn't tell Tom the truth.
Mine is better than yours.
It's a good car!
I know that Tom is a jerk.
Eat all you want.
What sport would you rather play?
Please don't forget to say goodbye to your family.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
May I ask who you are?
You forgot me.
Teachers should explain everything in detail, not just tell students to go home and read their books.
Tom isn't driving his car today.
Who is the last?
Are you ready?
Are you people?
What we don't do makes us stronger.
Have you become witches?
Most Hollywood films have a happy ending.
That's all for now.
Whose truck is this?
We're headed there.
Did anyone call the security forces?
We need to get to know Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
We are expecting guests for this evening.
Get out of here!
I don't know what to say to Tom.
We can, or we don't.
I could ask you to walk with me.
They say that whoever does something will do it again.
Tom is drunk.
Get to work!
Are you serious?
Are you drunk?
The famous Kabyle writer Mulud Faraun, who killed the OAS terrorists in 1962, seems to have said: "We do not know who we are until we become someone else".
I need someone to help me.
He's going to learn French.
I think it's a beautiful place.
Come here.
I think Tom and Mary are tired.
We're not attached to Tom.
How long?
Sami didn't need that.
The way to get us through the mess is to go straight ahead.
I hope Tom is scared.
He didn't help his father.
I hurried home.
Human religion is more open than the religion of God.
I didn't hear anyone.
Do not go!
I don't eat fish that isn't cooked.
I eat and drink.
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Show me that.
Leave it all behind.
I'm not a girl.
Do you like dogs?
Do you like football?
Champagne, please.
I want you to work with them.
Sami didn't like that.
She tried to listen to my conversation.
Tom is not a good friend of Mary's.
Who are you waiting for?
I want to know who's coming with us.
Someone should stop you.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I just want to tell you that I love you.
Who is your brother?
Were you here alone?
Sami has known Layla for many years.
Go ahead and get it!
Mine is better than yours.
You can kill anyone.
Beauty is light.
I didn't understand what the teacher said.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
He spent a few months in Scotland.
I'm going to eat beans.
We are trying.
Your time has come!
Why?
I have no idea.
Have you read the book "The Last Beginning of Reason" by Tahir Ya'ut?
You fool!
Please, call Tom in.
Will you be in Boston next Monday again?
Did someone call you?
She can't love you.
Tom lives in Australia.
Tom has been in trouble many times.
Tom's hair is black.
Don't forget your phone.
It's not a problem at all!
The snake gives a hoot!
Have you seen my sister?
How do I correct typing errors in Kabyle in LibreOffice?
Why are you sitting alone?
The Muslim god only understands Arabic; but one can pray to other gods in any language one wants.
Your father has a fever.
You need a good wife.
Something is missing.
Lend me your car for a change.
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
Add another cookie.
What are you having for lunch?
What happened in Boston?
I know that Tom is from Australia.
Tell him tomorrow.
He refused to let me sleep.
Why don't you do all that?
Let Tom go.
Tom showed it to Mary.
Mistakes have been made.
There must be someone who can do something.
Get out of here!
Just talk to them.
I want to see your sister.
What would they know?
I'm going to learn English now.
We'll do it one more time.
I didn't speak French when I got there.
You're sick to keep working in a place like this.
What do you want her to do?
Thank you, that's all.
Tom is getting married in October.
Don't you know that you can solve this problem yourself?
Is there anyone you want to see?
Sami was trying to get better.
Sami was young.
Both my parents were born in Boston.
He asked his friend.
The whole room is burned.
Tom couldn't get into Harvard University.
I don't think you spoke to me.
The government was under pressure from the people.
Grandfather likes to read.
I want to see my son.
Tom loves his job.
Sami is not going to be happy.
What did your agent say?
Keep your eyes open.
I am a whore.
Do you understand?
You have me mad!
He knows how to play with words.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
Close your windows!
He will arrive tonight.
Tom seems tired.
Call me sometime, will you?
He cheated on her!
Are you Japanese?
I'm close.
How I miss you!
I was in love with her.
Tom is a bum.
Can you do more than that?
Tom took his daughter to school.
It's a cold!
They shouted.
Please be slow.
Start singing.
Tom was born on the twentieth of October.
Tell me what I should do then.
This is for you.
Mary said that Tom did it.
Have you heard?
Show yourself!
Tom loves us both.
I want to make her happy.
My father is a doctor.
Tom is pissed.
He drove his car into a parking garage.
He can talk.
You are all ready.
Why do you want to run?
We should not have done it.
Tom was in Boston on October 20.
Will you promise to sleep with me tonight?
They made him a prisoner of war.
Tom has given me a lot of work to do.
There's someone outside.
You have a black book.
When are you going?
Is something bothering you?
Did they blow them up?
How many points does a sentence have?
What time do you want to eat?
Someone killed Tom.
I think Tom is getting tired.
Finish your study.
He swept the room.
Please burn it.
Do you think I should do that or not?
Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band.
Tom is waiting for someone.
Mary accepted.
The whiskey is passing.
They're gone.
Polish is my mother tongue.
No one listens to the speech.
My arms are empty.
Tom called Mary.
Our business is so busy that it's over.
I'm going next month.
I heard something.
Tom is a bigot.
Tom said we should be patient.
Shut up Tom!
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
There is nothing!
I know Tom is upset.
Someone poisoned us.
I called my lawyer.
How much do teachers pay?
What are you reading?
Tom started talking.
It's obvious where I'm going.
Women like to talk.
I'll take your suggestion.
I don't think Tom would want to do that like we do.
Will someone tell me what happened here?
I haven't kissed Tom yet.
There is no joke.
I am a Russian.
Is there anyone you want to meet?
We'll send someone.
Did someone call you?
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom didn't come to the bathroom.
I haven't been home since October.
I don't eat too fast.
Tom cheated on Mary.
Put it back!
Your work is taking a toll.
I didn't take the case.
I read.
I don't know.
You have made me angry!
I was as crazy as you.
Someone called.
Keep your eyes open.
Is there something bothering you?
I've been waiting for hours.
Sami followed Layla on Instagram and she followed him.
Someone has died.
We suspected him of lying.
Stop it!
Please stay.
You are a fool.
Clean your room.
I smoked when I was young.
Tom is disrespectful.
Thank you, Sherlock.
Someone left his umbrella.
No one will listen.
We'll talk to Tom on October 20.
Can't you eat with us?
Are you safe?
Sami got into Layla's car.
I told Tom that I would never go to the store with him again.
Is that true?
Are you sure he'll come?
Tom talked to the crowd.
I will arrive on October 20.
How many books do you read per week?
You were in Boston.
Tom talks a lot.
Can anyone tell me why Tom is angry?
Do you remember when you did it?
Tom is dying.
You are welcome.
You seem to be sure.
He is fine.
They stopped.
Call Tom now.
Tom needed someone to help him.
Does this room have a sweet and sour side?
How much peanut butter have you eaten?
It is good.
Tom will stay.
Tom and Mary explained why they were there.
I am originally from Australia.
I was told a few days ago.
I wish I was in Australia next Christmas.
Tom wanted to forgive Mary.
You are really a genius!
The last person I met thought I was a jerk.
Ayako, you are a little bit tired.
Let him do it.
Tom will be here next week.
Tom is here, isn't he?
I like to travel.
Did you eat enough?
They've chosen you.
You are a weirdo!
We do not use force unless it is necessary.
The day has come.
Tom didn't take off his hat.
Sami went to a soccer match.
You are eating.
It is a common plant in the Kabila region.
Tom was lying to Mary.
Someone could get hurt.
So, I must finish this work by tomorrow.
Ask Alex about it.
Stop fighting with each other.
I didn't know you had a brother.
No one asked you.
He likes to walk.
No one is listening.
Follow this car.
Get out of here!
Did you see anything?
I love this game.
I fight for my body.
I am not your servant.
He is old.
The children are making a lot of noise.
Read this!
I won't leave you.
Tom studied law school.
He speaks five languages.
Ask for another one.
Stay here.
We'll stay with him.
Wait for him.
The audience laughed.
Write it in French.
Clean your room.
We hope this will never happen again.
Tom is making this dress.
Do you remember me?
He carved his own grave.
Tom can't eat himself.
Do you doubt that Tom loves me?
Please go home.
Just slowly.
I am happy.
She refused his help.
Have you considered it?
Stop reading!
I understand that you know a lot about Australia.
Tom is the chief investigator.
You are a fool!
You're being too nice!
Tom wanted to buy Mary.
We should tell Tom.
You'll find yourself feeling a little disappointed after you rushed out of the airport.
I've already read this book.
Won't you come to my house?
Obviously you're all wrong.
He is afraid of death.
Did you see anything?
Take care of yourselves.
Not yet.
That's enough!
The Kabyle hero loves all corners of the world.
Are you ready?
We must respect human rights.
Sami doesn't complain.
Can I have a bath?
Where are we now?
He sometimes forgets to put books in the trunk.
The weather is up.
Tom loved French when he was in high school.
How many points does a sentence have?
Do you want to eat now?
Shut the door.
I'm going to leave soon.
Tom isn't in Boston right now.
Tom told me you didn't win.
Is that the name of the little shop next to where Tom works?
It's close.
Nothing hurts like the truth.
She issued him a ticket to court.
Are you a foreigner?
Someone called.
Go as soon as you can if anyone can help.
Where do you cook them?
Run away!
No one hates you.
I know we're different.
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
I have forgiven the cow for her wheat and added her spelt.
You sound like your mother.
Why hasn't Tom answered my message?
Tom has been in prison since October.
If you eat it, you will die.
I hope you have a good day.
What is this?
Have you learned to play guitar?
What are you called?
Tom is always looking for pretty girls.
Someone grabbed me by the arm.
Don't swim here.
Are you writing a letter?
He told me an incredible story.
Layla's friends were her friends.
I'm sorry I'm not staying in Boston.
Please go.
Do you have a house in Australia?
They are happy.
Tom is worried.
Is there anyone you want to meet?
Just be careful.
Are you sad?
Tom took his brother.
I hate my computer.
Do you want food?
Did you hear me?
Whoever tells the truth will tie the donkey.
Tom lives in Australia with his family.
Sami started eating.
Then why are you here?
Do you know my wife?
Were you happy in Portugal?
They have water.
I was eating something.
Do you have any friends?
This job is good.
Tom has a sister in Australia.
They made their way to the village.
Stop dreaming about it.
What are you most afraid of?
I am a subject.
Is your stomach leaking?
Tom didn't like him, but he missed him.
I hope no one saw you do it.
I want to go with you.
Do you think Tom committed suicide?
Keep looking!
You refuse to pay.
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't do that.
I like wine.
Why are you laughing?
You made mistakes.
It's cold outside.
I wonder what it might be.
I need some light.
Please don't forget what we said.
We are proud of this beautiful climate.
Time is passing.
I can help Tom.
What is the matter with all of them?
I think you wanted the job.
Did something happen?
You need to sleep.
Don't tell anyone.
Who built the computers?
Tom is upset.
I fell down.
You're older than Tom.
Follow your sister's example.
I don't want to stay at home.
They will do what I tell them.
No one likes that.
Tom knows where you live.
It's just a bubble there.
No one knows.
Please beat him gently.
The world is full of idiots.
Tom was arrested.
We will start sending people to work in October.
Do you have a moment?
I'm going to Australia.
Hello, what did they call you?
Do not move.
I'm looking at you.
They died.
Call us when you get there.
What are you wearing?
Give me the trunk.
Tom said he didn't feel well.
I got a call.
I ate a book.
I'm eating a turkey.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Finish your complaint!
You are all sick.
You better go.
When do you want me to call you?
Wash your clothes.
Why did you go there?
They are the same age.
You should stay away from them.
I was being read by someone I thought was my friend.
Tom was born in the 90s.
Sami was cleaning his Library.
You might want to stop.
No one knows why.
What else?
Can you read this?
Tom saw everything.
I don't want to be bothered.
Kabyles respect all peoples.
Tell him.
Was anyone hurt?
He likes to walk.
You are the girls.
I saw someone kiss Tom.
That's not what I'm saying.
Someone is watching you.
Stop being a dick.
We saw the movie together.
Women are all about sharing.
Keep your strength up.
Did you all understand?
You are a listener.
Will you pass the driving test?
Please don't forget what we said.
How many books do you have?
Does Tom have to stay home today?
Sami still has Layla's pictures.
Someone stole my watch.
I want to die.
Stop dreaming about it.
You are sick.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
Are you alone?
No one cares.
I know Tom can win.
They ate a wounded elephant.
I hope you are clear.
Get out of here!
You must come with me.
Call me back!
Can you drive Tom home?
She speaks Portuguese.
When did you get back from Germany?
You should be careful of your behavior.
Can you help me?
You don't have to go to work.
Can you help me, please?
What's your name?
Are you new?
The room is heating up.
Get up!
Who are you waiting for?
Try to calm her down.
How could Tom not love me?
Hello to you all.
We must go.
Are you going to leave me?
Paul was born in Rome.
He can sing.
Have you read this book before?
Stop moving!
What were you doing when I called you this morning?
It is impossible.
You wear a scarf well.
Don't make up your mind.
I hope no one saw you come here.
A soldier refuses to fight!
Do you want to eat?
I think you're having a blast!
I don't see what to tell you.
Are you Canadians?
I want you to leave town.
No one is listening.
Today is the twentieth of October.
Aren't you happy that he's rich?
Tom got there before Mary.
Tom has a guitar.
I like the dress Mary wears.
Are they going to listen?
This is working.
Have you read this?
I never tried to dress up to do that.
I'm sure you'll like it.
She is a liar.
Tom is angry, isn't he?
You must come with me.
Tom lived with his uncle in Australia when he was a student at university.
Tom's hands are tied.
Your time has come!
Is there anyone here?
Tom is patient.
Tom is smoking.
Sami was trying to get Layla to sleep.
Tom and Mary were sitting in the back.
I believe you.
Tom is a bad boy.
October is still three months away.
You are old.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
The waves are falling.
How far did you give them?
Where is your grandson?
I am an American citizen.
Layla was being groomed.
Wait a minute.
You need to rest.
He asked about you.
Computers make people stupid.
Sami is Farid's friend.
He was a swede.
How long can I stay here?
Did someone call you?
Do not chew food.
Don't throw it in the sand.
I felt like I was being cheated.
The moon is not shining.
You must go.
Tom doesn't let anyone in his house.
Who did you go with?
I thought you'd recognize Tom.
Tom thinks he's better than everyone else.
You speak too fast.
They want to learn English.
Tom didn't say anything.
I love you, Tom.
Please go!
There is no doubt.
You are lying.
I just got back from school.
This is very good.
What is your friend's name?
Do you see how Tom looks at you?
They crossed the bridge.
Don't restrict yourself to food if you don't want to.
Respect yourself.
Are you angry?
Then, the dreams turned out different.
Are you teachers?
Are you lost?
Is there nothing you can do?
Someone has taken my place.
Let's sleep on it.
Try to get Tom busy.
I will never forgive you.
It was a very good day.
I'm waiting for a phone call.
You know the way.
I know that Tom is not Canadian.
Writing for yourself is good.
I blew the whistle!
I don't like this story.
Are you going to Boston tomorrow?
You are a bunch of assholes.
Tell Tom that you lied.
Go to bed early.
I can teach you how to sing.
I'm your friend.
You drink too.
Tom and Mary both swim.
I haven't done that since October.
Think about your future.
I took Tom to his home in Boston.
I hate him to death.
How did you find her new novel?
You are drunk.
Tom said he wouldn't go to Mary's wedding.
He understood with his eyes.
Why do I have to do this alone?
Why are you reading this?
Someone is watching Tom.
Get in the house!
Tom doesn't like Mary.
Change your clothes!
You should learn from your mistakes.
Tom didn't turn on Mary.
What time do you think you'll leave?
Are you ready?
I've spoiled your sleep.
Has anyone died?
The back door is open.
I'm eating.
They said nothing.
Make me a sandwich.
Nothing stops Tom from reaching his goal.
Tom said he never learned French.
I have a drink.
You love your Kabyle culture.
He gave us everything we needed.
Someone might hear you.
Why doesn't anyone speak?
It's hot today.
She didn't understand the answer.
Have you heard her new song?
You are blinded by love.
I think he is not alive.
Darwin wrote about the evolution of species.
Someone is trying to kill me.
Are you pregnant?
You don't have to go to work.
I made a doll for Ann.
Running is a good sport.
Don't restrict yourself to food if you don't want to.
I saw one.
I couldn't do it without someone's help.
Tom told everyone that he was hungry.
Tom lost his bed.
A dog is following us.
Do not be shy.
I'm not trying to say that I don't want to go to Boston.
You are screaming.
Do you see me as pretty?
Bring me a bottle of wine.
Have you ever worked with them?
Is Tom still here?
Tom and Mary got married in October.
You are in Boston.
I still remember doing that.
There is a guest coming.
Hello, Lisa. How are you?
I cut it in two pieces.
May I ask who you are?
I'm not washing your car.
Listen to me!
I'm as hungry as a dog.
I don't want to eat here.
Mary was bitten by Tom's dog.
Ask your neighbor.
You can go home now.
Don't you read this book?
The old man learned to write.
Someone stole my suitcase.
Don't worry, there will be a solution to your problem.
I'd love to go fishing with Tom again.
Tom was killed by Mary.
What do you want then?
I obviously forgot we weren't called.
Tom loved me.
Tom tried to save Mary.
I don't want you to sit here and watch me hide.
I'm learning Latin because it's my favorite language.
It's going to snow today.
What do you want?
Somebody has made a mistake.
Give me a cup of coffee, please!
We always speak French to each other.
Where are you going today?
Please do something.
Get started !
I need someone to talk to.
I think you tried to deceive us.
My hand is weak.
Someone is watching Tom.
You're the one who's lying. I'm not.
He is here!
Don't count on luck.
Are you an American?
Can we ask you a few questions?
Tom can't save Mary.
He was suspicious of the witch case.
I like insects.
Tom is outside.
Is it true that Tom is going to Boston?
Someone is waiting for you.
It is good!
I couldn't do it without your help.
Tom has lost his mind.
He wrote a love poem.
You can use my dictionary.
You should look up this word.
Sami is sitting outside in this heat.
He likes to study.
Have you read this?
You are grown.
Have you eaten?
Someone tried to kill Tom.
Where will you be on October 20th?
Tom cut his hair.
That's how I got to know them.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
You need to rest.
I like the summer.
Get more out.
Are you alive?
Get up off your feet!
Please, don't be such a dick.
Tom was angry with Mary.
I don't care at all.
We really liked that.
We got married on October 20, 2013.
Please dress yourself.
Have you read this?
I don't think Tom needs our help.
Tom has a kidney disease.
I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you.
Can you walk Tom home?
Are you a Buddhist?
If you eat it, you will die.
Tom is finished.
From the heart.
Just look at my new car.
Tom eats all the time.
Once again, what is it?
What time is it in Boston?
One of them is a senior, already retired.
What's the name of the song you're singing tonight?
Stop there.
Are you Russians?
Tom ate something.
Have you been swimming?
He is trying to save his life.
Shut him up.
Are you scared?
Honestly, I don't want to see anything.
At first, he couldn't speak any English.
I told you this would happen.
Can I ask a rude question?
Tom was surprised.
Where are you?
Drink up!
Tom was against Mary's hiring.
This is the end.
Why didn't you ask someone?
Let's try something.
Tom will be back next week.
Please stay.
You are real.
Are you talking?
I've already read this book.
I'm not eating here.
Tom isn't afraid to ask for help.
You are hot!
Tom lives in Australia, right?
I know all his friends and I know what he tells them to do.
Someone stole my knife.
Your parents love me very much.
I'm the only one in this group who doesn't speak French.
They're all waiting.
He won, and he kissed me.
Churchill met with Stalin in late 1944.
I never thought I would win.
I'm tired of this wall.
Someone has taken my place.
I ran away.
He is a fool!
I'm in the process of translating.
I am a Muslim, but I like wine.
Tom is a winner.
Are you making such a joke about me?
If you have a good garden, it will add value to your house.
I hope I didn't write the comments.
They are drowning.
I hope Tom is strong.
I'm hired to work with you.
Can't you see we're talking?
It's work.
Do you understand?
Who wrote the sentence?
Someone saw you.
How was the time in Boston?
