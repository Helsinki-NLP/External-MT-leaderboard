Professor calls 911 and confesses to killing his girlfriend.
University professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told police he shot his girlfriend with a gun and told them to come to the house, only with a slight shudder.
Lamb said that his "lovely dog" was alive and probably upset, and that the dead woman's family's phone numbers could be found on her cell phone.
Officers found Amy Prentiss's lifeless body in the house and a handwritten note on a white notebook that read, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could put everything back, I loved Amy so much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me", the officers said, signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus where Ethan Scmidt, a beloved history professor for the police, was also shot and killed by Lamb outside his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard gunshots at 10:18.
He also said Lamb made the 911 emergency call shortly after that.
Later in the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as police approached him.
A day after the school shooting left students and professors hiding behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what drove Lamb to do it.
The details extracted from investigators on both sides of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, painted a picture of a gifted but probably troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to taking her class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal or criminal record.
Schmidt even referred to Lamb in a book he wrote as one of the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students took lessons from both.
However, there were also signs of mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke highly of Lamb, noted that he was also a worried and nervous person and that he "seemed to have a problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously applied for sick leave from Delta State University citing some health issues.
He only taught two classes online this year.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policies did not guarantee Lamb would automatically become a full-time faculty member, despite his hard-earned doctorate.
University dean William LaForge stated that he did not know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it was obvious that Lamb had something on his mind".
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After the campus was cleared, police traced Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said Lamb committed suicide in the backyard of a home about a mile from his family's home in the Greenville, Mississippi suburbs with a single .38-caliber handgun before he was arrested.
Lamb's car was found on the highway.
While it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to the house, Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the residents.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at the university in 2009, teaching geography and education to 3,500 students in the city of about 12,000.
She got her doctorate in education this spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a nice, big guy who tried to teach him how to play guitar for a few years.
He was a man whose heart beat so fast back then.
Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon, said of Lamb, "When he came, all the girls would melt".
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously dating for a while.
Lamb said on the 911 call, "I killed my wife", but there's no record of them getting married.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in their brick house by the river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was in good condition.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but he and Prentiss have always been friends, and they now have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also stated that his daughter was completely devastated.
He and his mother were great friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail performed at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together in public performances.
O'Steen stated that his daughter wrote and sang the music herself.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, who served as bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a seedy bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5 after Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica to a small audience.
There was no sign of a problem.
He said they were a pretty happy couple.
Sometimes we cut and threw lines at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the same university, said the murdered professor Schmidt was leading a seminar program for first graders and was an expert on Native American and colonial history.
He was married and had three teenage children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas, and was president of a student solidarity group he founded.
On Tuesday night, about 900 people, including academics, university staff, students and visitors from the local community, attended a candlelight vigil on the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the memorial service, where the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes are on Wednesdays.
LaForge said, "We're trying to get our students back".
The crisis is over.
It's time to heal.

Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (in Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed to the story.
This news text was edited to reflect that police stated that Lamb called 911 after killing Schmidt, and that there was no official evidence that the two were married, although Lamb referred to Prentiss as "his wife" in the 911 call.
Toys R Us plans to buy fewer holiday elements
Toys R Us announced that it will not hire as many holiday season employees this year as it did last year, but the toy and baby product manufacturer said it would give more work opportunities to existing employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in its stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be part-time.
The company said interviews with candidates will begin this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
With months to go before the holiday season, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip their stores and help them sell, ship and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox joked about his "relationship" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also very important for personal reasons.
In the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time, she explains: "We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana was going to be sitting next to me.
The movie started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and arm stretch to me.
Back in Time, a documentary about the film Back to the Future, features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future first came to light 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel movie I've ever made".
Back in Time will be released on VOD and DVD, as well as select theaters.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
On Russia's growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the nearly five-year-old Syrian problem "cannot be solved by military intervention" and that more weapons would only lead to more violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together and engage in constructive talks in order to find a political solution to the issue.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council, the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France, at the UN General Assembly meeting to be held towards the end of the month.
He expressed deep regret that the division between the council members and the Syrian people had "made the problem insoluble" by regional forces.
Ban invited the five permanent members to unite in the Syrian crisis as they did in the Iran nuclear deal.
Eight polls show Donald Trump is serious
Some tried to label it as flammable.
The others threw it at him like it was a joke.
And some are supporting internal explosion.
Some Republicans have tried to push Donald Trump down in the polls, but it hasn't worked.
The last 11 national polls have put him in double digits ahead of Donald Trump, and some are seriously questioning the real estate mogul's chances of running.
Of course, it's early in the election cycle.
None of this means Trump can win the Republican nomination race.
Experts say that Rick Perry's rise during these periods in 2011 also caused a rise for Herman Cain, both of whom failed to win the nomination process in a single state.
And there are many reasons why he's going to be in trouble in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC group and the economic conservative Growth Club are realizing Trump's enduring power and are starting to spend their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent polling results showing that the real estate empire is not just a temporary thing:
Trump's approval ratings have changed 180 degrees.
A poll at Monmouth University just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed two out of 10 Republicans had a favorable opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
It was 52 percent in early August.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 express a negative view.
And those numbers are looking high in the early stages.
Last week, a poll in Quinnipiac, Iowa, showed that 60 percent of Republicans there favor Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters might be happy with Trump's candidacy.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "sad" if he was nominated.
Only Ben Carson is as enthusiastic as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiastic" while 40% say Trump is).
The other person closest to the enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters said they would be "displeased" or "saddened" if Jeb Bush, the party's favorite, ran.
The majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been criticized for his flashy language and insults, a poll of 52 percent of Republicans polled Monday by ABC News/Washington Post found that the real estate mogul is in the right frame of mind to be president.
The same is true in Iowa, where the nation's first party convention is being held, where 52 percent of Republicans believe he has the personality to lead, according to Quinnipac last week.
Still, 44 percent feel he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't suit the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their political pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who the best candidate to win the GOP nomination was, four out of 10 people said Trump was the best.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 people put their money in Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal ball of GOP voters has been less clear.
In the last election cycle of that period, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be the nominee, compared to only 28 percent who chose Mitt Romney, who was the eventual nominee.
It still seems that the majority of GOP voters find Trump's election campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans rally around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field may also contribute to Trump's rise, and it's a fact that anti-Trump support is scattered among more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September showed that Trump has won the support of the majority each time, in a likely head-to-head matchup between Trump and many Republican candidates.
She's ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14, Walker by 15, Jeb Bush by 19, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In the event of a possible head-to-head, Ben Carson leads the businessman by 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made their decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they've locked down their ballots.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they won't change their mind.
Forty-six percent said they left the door open to change candidates.
Trump's biggest rival is still brain surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made their decision are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the forefront and center of his 2016 conversations.
Some think Trump's over-talking is alienating important Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and will hurt his rebranding efforts.
But a new ABC/Post poll on Monday found that six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration is on the agenda, Trump seems to be on the agenda.
Anger at the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are getting roughly half the Republican vote because of their largely out-of-state status.
In a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they'd rather have someone from outside the government than someone with government experience.
And they're angry with Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago found that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were angry at Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent saying they were "dissatisfied" and 21 percent saying they were "extremely angry".
In the Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn will take the podium for the first time.
Since the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn's appearance on the Prime Minister's Question Show has been eagerly awaited.
New Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will take the podium for the first time since David Cameron at the Prime Minister's Questions.
Mr Corbyn will be asking six questions shortly after noon, and his performance looks set to be closely watched by the media and Labour MPs.
In his weekly show, he called for "less theater and more reality".
He also said he could skip some sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
This confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test of leadership, following his appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's silence during the reading of the national anthem at a memorial service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was also criticised by some Tory MPs and made front-page headlines in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem has drawn attention.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he stood in "respectful silence" and appreciated "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But Owen Smith, one of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet members, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief in abolishing the monarchy.
While about a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's senior team because of differences over the economy, defence and foreign relations, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant notes that policy differences within the Labour Party are also "growing" over Mr Corbyn's appointment to the EU and the government's implementation of the aid ceiling.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that he had proposed new changes to the Labour Party's ceiling completely.
Hours later, the shadow minister for work and pensions, Mr Smith, said the party was only against the government lowering the £26,000 ceiling to £23,000 and was "very open" about it.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron on the floor of the House of Commons since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader has promised a different approach to politics, saying he has received "publicly sourced" and over 30,000 recommendations to ask Mr Cameron.
MP Islington North told the Prime Minister that the Q&A programme was very provocative and would focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people rather than "reasoning" and ironic rhetoric.
Mr Corbyn, when he was not, for example when Mr Cameron was travelling abroad, told the Prime Minister's Questions programme that he would be represented by his shadow trade minister, Angela Eagle.
He has even suggested that other colleagues should take the floor from time to time, and he has asked the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to address the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron expressed his desire to move away from the "Puppet Game" style of politics often associated with the Prime Minister's Questions programme, but admitted a few years later that he had failed to do so.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, Questions to the Prime Minister has been used as a primary gauge of leaders' decision-making abilities, their position among the ruling class in the House of Commons and MPs; however, some critics have expressed that this has been caricatured and that far-reaching reforms are needed.
'Filmed in Joburg': Homeless youths are training in photography
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place for the homeless.
But a group of former street kids have found a way to earn a living by acquiring a new skill.
I was shot in Joburg, a nonprofit studio that teaches homeless youth to take pictures of their neighborhoods and make a living from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound is rising as wages in the UK accelerate.
The pound rose sharply following data showing rising wages in the United Kingdom, while the FTSE 100 index rose following a takeover bid for SABMiller.
Wages excluding premiums in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9% between May and July compared with the same period of the previous year.
This rate, which represents the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as a leading indicator for possible interest rate increases.
Sterling gained more than 1% against the US dollar to $1,5505 and the euro gained 0.84% to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index is up 1.49% to 6.229.21 points.
The most notable company in this rise was SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase with its attractive acquisition offer from rival AB InBev.
This offer will bring together the world's two largest beer companies and bring together the world's most recognizable brands, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch, under one roof.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% on positive earnings news from rival luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures have exceeded expectations and show that sales are starting to pick up again in China, one of Burberry's key markets.
Shares of mining giant Glencore rose 5% after it announced it had made $2.5 billion from the sale of allocated shares as part of the company's debt reduction strategy.
Shares of packaging and paper group Mondi were among the most impaired stocks, with a 4.3% loss after Goldman Sachs downgraded its offer for the company to "Sell".
Shares of JD Sports rose 3.1 per cent after the company announced a six-month pre-tax profit of £46.6 million, an 83 per cent increase.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports Chairman Peter Cowgill said that a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But he said that he felt that his spending power would not be enough to cover the high employee costs of his company.
He added that the expense would affect JD Sports' expansion plans and that it could mean less extra work.
Metcash has launched a public campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend its retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against a $700 million Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and are trying to build the IGA brand with mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide fair.
IGA retailers and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Simmo, a Dunsborough-based ice cream manufacturer that offers taste tests in IGA stores, and with shop owners who sell their loyal customers South Australian Football League tickets at a discount.
Food, beverage and hardware retailer Metcash is expected to provide more details on its defense strategy as it adjusts its annual investor strategy day on September 29.
The risk is high, as South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australian and Western Australian retailers are negatively narrow-minded, and IGA retailers enjoy much stronger market share than they do in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% more in GA and 24% more in BA than in the Eastern states.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take about 5% of the grocery market within 12 months of opening its first stores in those two states, with sales going to existing players but generally unrelated retailers.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose $360 million in a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This is based on Aldi's forecast that it will open 25 stores in GA and 30 in BA next year, and generate sales figures of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
Mr. Kierath noted that the loss of grocery and grocery store sales and Metcash's high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash approximately $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite recent Roy Morgan research that found IGA customers to be the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's grocery and grocery sales will decline by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, reducing its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, a leading fund manager, said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "could very likely be wiped out in ten years".
Metcash declined to comment on Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it appears a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's revenue from its food and grocery business, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43% since 2012, an indication that operating leverage is declining as sales and margins come under pressure.
But the wholesaler is resisting, investing more than $150 million a year in matching shelf prices for hundreds of products each week at Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers revamp their stores, adding faster-growing fresh foods, and opening a better specialty-labelled chain of stores to the public.
Metcash executive chairman Ian Morrice says price matching and store renovation programs are starting to pay off, and the wholesaler is expected to return to core profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
According to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis was an accidental casualty of the recent storm that hit his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than criticism.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo normally referred to as the "Special K's", found himself under the unwelcome spotlight for Kyrgios' face-lifting crushing of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a tough qualifier in Cincinnati that afternoon, Kokkinakis and opponent Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the elephant referee, with Harrison stating: "Wawrinka came on Kyrgios, so I have to go on that kid".
Most recently seen at the US Open potentially breaking his racket to the displeasure of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was faithfully defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing in Glasgow with Sam Groth in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain for second place behind Bernard Tomic.
Healy said, "What I feel quite eagerly about is that I think Thanasi is a little bit drawn to the debate".
He broke his racket when he lost in the U.S.A. But he's not the first player to break his racket because he was disappointed in himself, and I know Thanasi knows he shouldn't be proud of that.
But in reality, in the United States, Harrison and others have handled themselves quite well under extremely provocative circumstances, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team, a great family, and I think he's been pushed a little too hard.
He's 19 years old, but he's extremely mature, he works hard and he fits in with the team, he has no problems with the other players, he's very respected in the locker room, he's doing some tough training, he's a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged by his peers.
Healy also supported the decision to tolerate Kyrgios for an important draw, explaining that from Friday onwards, what was right for everyone was to "mutually decide" but support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term mainstay.
Healy said, "First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the game, not the arguments around [Kyrgios]",
And I think that as people like Nick, Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's risen up so fast, he's grown up in the public eye, and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not in the spotlight, he's deeply thinking that my thinking is right, that it's what's best for the team and what's best for him.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detain migrants
Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, declaring a state of emergency to stem the flow of migrants and detaining those trying to enter the country illegally.
Hundreds of migrants have been gathering in the neutral zone, creating chaos at the border and Serbian authorities have reacted with anger.
Migrants fleeing violence in their own countries set up tents along the roadside for an indefinite period of time between checkpoints in both countries.
But their anger grew.
As a police helicopter passed overhead, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and hurled insults at the Hungarian agile police.
Some refused to accept food and water as a protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that Hungary's return of migrants from Macedonia and Greece was "unacceptable" as the flow of migrants continues.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not be harmed by this process.
In the coming days, it will be necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries", Dacic said in Prague.
The tensions on the Hungary-Serbia border came just a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common migration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who have been attacking Greece and Italy, and spoke of the hope that an agreement could be reached to admit another 120,000 migrants to EU countries by the end of next month or year, including those from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for an EU summit next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
Hungary is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the matter.
The emergency call issued Tuesday in two southern regions gives authorities broad powers to deal with the crisis, including closing roads if necessary and speeding up asylum-related cases.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country planned to pull a barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from that country after the barbed wire was pulled to the Serbian border.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agata reports that prisoners are even being deployed to pull the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major gateway and transit point to European Union countries, and many of these migrants are refugees fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of arriving migrants are "economic migrants" trying to cross into Europe for a better life rather than innocent people fleeing war - a view that is in stark contrast to that of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws that took effect in Hungary at midnight make it a crime to cross or damage the 4-meter (13 feet) barbed wire that crosses the border with Serbia and impose harsher penalties on human traffickers.
Speaking to reporters in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency due to the situation caused by mass migration".
We are very clear on one thing: it is a crime to cross the border illegally.
While the deployment is still pending congressional approval, Associated Press reporters in the area say they've seen soldiers with dogs and vehicles equipped with heavy weapons here for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities had arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 who crossed the border and entered the country.
They've been through the damage of barbed wire, and now they're in police custody and charged with a crime under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the barbed wire.
Hungarian authorities also used a train car covered with barbed wire to block one of the seven border crossings with Serbia, while closing two of them on Tuesday morning.
The chaos was also reflected at the main border crossing near Roszke, as the Hungarians moved a small metal container filled with people to carry out the operations.
20 people got in, but thousands were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the highway between Serbia and Hungary and said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders is cut in half in the national election
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton maintains a two-digit lead in the Democratic primary for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton currently holds 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%) while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he's running for president, is up 15% of the Democratic vote.
For more than five months before the primary, most Democratic voters said it was too early to decide which candidate to support.
But Clinton's supporters have more solid ideas about their choices than other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News, Clinton has been losing ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton is leading by a huge margin between women and moderates, but that gap is closing.
His support among men has plummeted, and Sanders trails him by just five points.
Clinton's under-50 Democratic voter advantage has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now on equal footing.
But Clinton is way ahead of the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was leading Sanders by two digits among liberals, but now Sanders is leading the group by five points.
At the national level, nearly half of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter will support him on certain conditions, while another 15 percent will only support him if he is a candidate.
Six percent of the people don't support Clinton.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters tend to be especially passionate about supporting her.
Opinions are even more mixed among those who do not support Clinton at the moment - only a quarter may support her passionately.
While 48 percent of Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican front-runners talk about Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters were asked open-ended questions about why they wanted Clinton to run, the top responses were that she had the right experience (16 percent), thought it was time to elect a woman president (13 percent), and was the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention a relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Being able to compromise on issues and being eligible are among the criteria.
As a potential vice president, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race, but a third don't think so.
When Democratic voters are asked what their second choice of candidate for the party is, Biden is in the top spot.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden could easily win reelection, according to Sanders.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, rising from 20 points in a race with Biden to 30 points in a race without Biden.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election, but that number has dropped to this level from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second in this regard, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely candidate has increased.
Again, when asked what's most important about a candidate, Democratic voters put the issues before electability.
Similar to last month, no Democratic candidate or candidate seems unlikely to be a candidate for this primary.
Democratic candidates, or candidates, perform well among their party's primary voters on some key characteristics.
Most see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the top three honesty contender, while Clinton is strong in leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, and about half of them say the same about Sanders (15 percent), while 27 percent have no idea.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as aligned with their own ideology.
By all accounts, a quarter of the Democratic voters have no idea who Sanders is.
While questions about his use of his personal email address and server during his State Department tenure continue, most Democratic voters find the explanation of the matter satisfactory and state that their views on it are unaffected.
But that's a different story for the general American public.
Half of the Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, while only a third find them satisfactory.
Public opinion on the issue was divided in March, shortly after the issue was brought under scrutiny.
Most Americans say their email quarrels have not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, while their negative opinion has increased by 36 percent.
These are mostly Republicans, and more than six out of 10 say they have a distorted view of Clinton.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by her own party's voters, the issue remains a problem among registered voters in general: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't find him honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't find Trump honest or trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are getting good marks in leadership.
Among the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson and Bush scored the highest on honesty.
More often than not, Sanders is honest, but like Carson, most people have no idea who he is.
The margin of error in the sample of 351 Democratic voters is 6%.
Ben Carson is just behind Donald Trump in the national polls.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running just behind Donald Trump.
New polling shows that two candidates are up for election with almost half the voters in favour, with the other candidates having little chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, rising from 23% in the last CBS poll before the Fox News debate last month to 27% in the poll released Tuesday.
But support for Carson has risen from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson did well in demographic groups, with support among college-educated Republican voters far higher than Trump.
The rest, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, have now fallen to 2% from 10% last month.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
This latest poll of 376 Republican voters has a margin of error of 6%, and the poll was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's support among Republicans rising to 19%, just behind Trump's 32%.
The most recent poll by ABC News/Washington Post puts Trump seriously ahead of Carson.
Faced with Carson's rise last week, Trump continued to randomly wave at the retired brain surgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said last Saturday, "We need energy".
Five fraternity members charged in the death of a freshman at Baruch College .
Almost two years after a college student was killed during a fraternity ceremony in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
At a September 2013 commencement ceremony, Chun "Michael" Deng was brutally attacked by the New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity, which, according to police, contributed to his death by delaying his transportation to the hospital.
Authorities report that he was blindfolded, clinging to a backpack full of 30 pounds of sand, and constantly being gagged as he tried to walk toward his target in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that he had headaches over time and then lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members didn't call 911 after Deng passed out and police say they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But according to police commissioner Chris Wagner, speaking at the press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, Googled his symptoms and contacted the national president of the fraternity, Andy Meng, for advice.
Lieutenant Wagner said that at this point, the members started hiding personal belongings and put the good of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng.
He was unable to be revived and died the next morning.
An autopsy report showed Deng suffered trauma from repeated blows to the head, torso and hip with an unsharp object.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement that many families have been broken as a result of Brotherhood admissions ceremonies, with at least one student dying at admissions ceremonies every year since 1970.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step taken by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe town grand jury has recommended that the first five members be tried for murder in the third degree.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal conspiracy.
Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday that we would hold not only the people involved but any organization that officially or unofficially confirmed it accountable.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?
With interest rates rising, the bull market is upside down, bond yields are rising, and the economy is in recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take.
History, especially in economics, provides little information about timing.
The recession has been as short as 11 months after the first interest rate increase, and as long as 86 months.
The Fed's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has been, if not continuous, often decisive in the response of the economy and financial assets.
That's why central bank officials have been so adamant that investors should focus not on when to start raising interest rates but on how long the normalization process will take.
It's true that there are variables.
But as a result, market participants may think that the interest rate hike is overblown.
Julian Jessop, the global chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients: "The Fed's first rate hike since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money.'"
On the contrary, we do not expect US interest rates to gradually return to normal, but the still low levels appear to be the seismic shock that many fear.
But we can't say it won't have an effect.
Based on past trends, the response of some sectors of the economy may be:
As we've seen in the market over the past few months, waiting for interest rates to rise can throw things off balance for a while.
And once the interest rate goes up, the effect won't be as noticeable.
In a new study of what happens after the Fed increases, Deutsche Bank analysts say "equity yields appear to be on a downward trend for 12-24 months after the first interest rate hike, which may reflect a slowdown in monetary policy".
According to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, an analyst at Nuveen Asset Management, who shared it with Barron's, the market has generally seen sharp increases over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - moving in a straight line toward interest rate increases after 250 days (average 2.6 percent increase) and returning to normal after 500 days, averaging 14.4 percent returns over the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the effect on stocks was more pronounced in the later stages of the rate-raise cycle, with yields heading for the brink of disappearance.
Depressions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes help them too.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that didn't exist before and that will accelerate the downturn.
The most remarkable thing is that gross domestic product is at its lowest level ever for the Fed's interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 percent increase since 1950, nominal gross domestic product has fallen below 4.5 percent only twice year over year.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, the Atlanta Fed said few expect this to be permanent, with the third quarter at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, raising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question of "will it be different this time around?"
Market participants, who have been waiting for the Fed to raise interest rates for a year, are focused on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends Thursday.
While most strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, futures trading only points to a 25 percent chance.
"In our research since 1950, all growth cycles to date have been in a super upward trend, with gross domestic product rapidly reaching pre-recession peaks after a recovery", the report said.
Rather, it was an unprecedentedly slow recovery from the worst recession in a typical period.
The current cycle was the longest the Fed had expected since the last recession - the longest on record was 35 months, and the one we're in is in its 74th month and still going on.
The market is expected to increase interest rates, so fixed income has become unstable and the order is somewhat similar to that of equity.
The difference is that when the Fed changes the course of its policy, the effect is more rapid in bonds than in stocks.
When the first up/down of the cycle comes, bond yields don't change direction immediately.
At the end of the cycle of interest rate increases, bond yields immediately fall", Deutsche said.
According to strategist Charles Schwab, interest rate increases will smooth the trend by bringing yields between longer and shorter-term bonds closer together.
Kathy Jones, a Schwab analyst, said that high-yield bonds generally perform better in this environment, but "we're still careful about reaching yield".
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adjusting to the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is adjusting to tighter monetary policy", he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all features that will be seen in the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies doing most of their business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and more attractive local products.
The situation for multinational companies with high debt will be worse, because rising dollar prices will make their products more expensive on the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
In a report for their clients, Goldman Sachs analysts said: "History shows that 'quality' stocks can underperform at the beginning of such a rise".
Companies with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percent following increases in 1994, 1999, and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility stocks also outperformed their low-quality competitors by an average of 4 and 3 percent, respectively.
The debt will become a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies with high volatility are the ones most likely to suffer.
In addition to the pure stock market game, consumers are also predicted to benefit from rising dollars.
Although experts differ on how fast to save, savers can also benefit from high returns.
Andrew Bingham said it was a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accused the station of 'making a mess'.
He argued that radio was becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial competitors.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, accusing her of rigging the Brit Awards.
His running mate Damien Collins accused The Voice of being unoriginal.
A representative who came forward pressured the broadcaster to reveal its difference to other commercial stations by saying that BBC Radio 3 was gradually "turning" to Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham told BBC bosses that the public service radio station was "getting dirtier" and increasingly out of step with its commercial rivals.
"I don't like to use that expression, but Radio 3 has become 'dirty,' it's becoming Classic FM", he said.
It also targeted the BBC Music Awards last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which were launched last year, are another version of the Brit Awards.
Bingham said, "So if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to mind, whereas you're just taking what's already on the market and copying it".
The BBC's director general has denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is clearly ahead of its commercial rivals in both live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to go and learn anything about classical music from anywhere else.
And that's a commitment to live music, and making music is unlike anything else.
He also said that I think it's very important that Radio 3 is trying to discover new music and promote new work.
Alan Davey, the manager of BBC Radio 3, had argued earlier this year that radio needed to work harder than in the past to reach a wider audience, as Britons are less educated in classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only component to be held to account as it stepped on the tail of the BBC's commercial rivals at the Culture, Media and Sport selection committee meeting.
Tory MP Damien Collins also attacked The Voice, the BBC's music talent competition, which was bought for £22 million from Dutch production company Talpa Media.
Can't you see why the show is making so much noise, because it's not original and it's not special?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was judged by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was made in a "BBC-like style".
He said he wanted the agency to "find a hit out of his own blood" before he ever did entertainment again.
However, he did not accept the idea of preventing the production of more O Voice programs in the future or spending the money spent on licensing fees on other formats.
Is Black Friday the reason internet sales hit their lowest point in August?
In the first three months of 2015, Internet sales increased by 7 percent.
Last month , the lowest growth since 2000 when records began to be broken .
Three years ago , when mobile devices were first introduced to shopping , Internet sales exploded .
Experts say Black Friday in November could be a factor in the spending cuts.
Online shopping has been booming for more than a decade, turning Britain's most vibrant shopping streets into ghost towns.
After figures showed an increase of only seven percent in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say there are more signs of decline.
Total spending in August was up only five percent from last year, the slowest growth since records began to be broken in 2000.
After figures showed that Internet sales increased by only 7 percent in the first three months of 2015, experts say there are signs of a further decline
Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian: "If you look at the growth levels of previous years and especially 2000 you actually see that over time things are going back to normal".
He added that three years ago, when consumers started using their mobile phones to buy products, internet sales saw a huge increase.
This meant that more people could shop even while lying on their couches.
But now it's going horizontal, you can see the descent.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept borrowed from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts say consumers may be looking forward to the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November, to buy something.
Last year's event saw five times as many consumers as the year before attack companies' websites to get cheap products.
Experts say Black Friday shoppers may have been restrained "for now" showing shoppers fighting for discounts.
A study published by the British Retailers Association found that 1 in every 5 pounds spent on shopping is spent on online shopping.
One third of some products, such as TVs and washing machines, are now bought online.
More than a quarter of people also buy clothes and shoes online rather than on the high-end shopping streets.
With the conviction of the bin Laden family, Muslims are saying goodbye to the last journey of those who died in the crane crash in Mecca.
The bodies of 29 people who died after the first funerals in Mecca were carried by Muslims in the streets.
Saudi Arabia has blamed the Saudi construction giant Binladin Group for the crane accident.
The health ministry reported that 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the bodies of 29 people who died when a crane fell on the Masjid-i-Haram.
The crowd, mostly white, blocked the roads to greet the first burials on their final journey to the Muaysim Cemetery in Mecca.
The crowd passed the holy site where a crane tore down the roof of a mosque and crashed on pilgrims.
The bodies of the dead were brought in for burial after the Saudi kingdom blamed the family of Binladin, owner of the construction holding, for the incident, which also resulted in 394 injuries.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who died when a crane fell on the Masjid-i-Haram were carried on the road.
Among the dead was Kasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram came to the Masjid-i-Haram with his parents at the beginning of the annual Hajj service.
Saudi leaders have announced that the Hajj will continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
In his speech today, King Salman said that the Binladin Holding group should not leave the crane arm open when it is not in use.
The Saudi Press Agency, which is run by the state, has prepared an Arabic version of the order, which states that the only party to be charged in connection with the incident is the Binladin Group.
The English service of the news agency did not pass on this detail, but it reported that the company officials were banned from going abroad.
Earlier in the week, Salman vowed to find a reason for the crane to hit the courtyard of the Masjid al-Haram, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are coming to perform the Hajj at the end of the month.
Binladin's group has not made any comment on the overturned crane and its representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal decree accused the group of failing to take up-to-date security measures and of failing to cooperate with meteorological authorities.
The Masjid-i-Haram in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, much of which is under the management of the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has had close ties to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and is the name behind many of its construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, the last leader of al Qaeda, was a wayward son whose adoption was forbidden by his family.
The accident occurred just days before millions of people were flocking to the Hajj pilgrimage, which every adult Muslim is required to visit at least once in their lives, amid heavy winds and rain.
Authorities said 158 people are still being treated in hospital.
Authorities have ordered the families of the dead and the survivors with permanent disabilities to be paid 1 million rials (£174,000) in compensation.
The other wounded will get half that.
The boss of B&Q says that the trend is due to Eastern European craftsmen working cheaply
Veronique Laury says the British are hiring more and more craftsmen
The reason for this increase is the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe
As a result, 200 new Screwfix stores are opening for artisans.
Kingfisher is also closing 60 B&Q outlets nationwide.
Written by Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent for the Daily Mail
It is said that the British began to employ skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do the work at home instead of leaving their hammers and paintbrushes
If you're a master hammerman or a wall-painter, you're in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, the British are hiring more and more craftsmen to do DIY jobs in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of home improvement chain Kingfisher, said the trend was driven by a huge increase in the number of skilled Eastern European craftsmen offering services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets and plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for artisans.
Ms. Laury said she wanted more women hired at B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions at the store were made by women.
The majority of the staff are men now.
She said that there is a need for single women who have more home improvements than in the past to meet the developing demographic trends.
"Our stores are still predominantly male", says Ms. Laury.
We need to balance even more.
Basically, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions about the products they buy are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laury, one of five women to head Britain's leading firm index, the FTSE100, has also restructured her senior team to include an equal number of male and female CEOs.
Kingfisher is almost alone in this field with a staff of 50 percent women, including the CEO and CFO.
"It was a conscious decision - diversity is a big deal here", Ms. Laury said.
It wasn't hard to find good women to take on our board.
After the group charged for the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher announced a decline in both bottom monthly profit and sales.
As a result of the trend, Screwfix and B&Q owner Kingfisher will open 200 new stores.
It 's time for the Fed to decide on a rate hike .
The two-day meetings of the U.S. central bank on Wednesday and Thursday are being watched by the world to decide whether to raise interest rates in ten years.
In a Reuters poll, just over half of the 80 economists who said last week that the Fed would implement the policy now think it will suspend it and keep rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
This is historic, because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said: "For the first time, we will see a major central bank move from zero to normalize interest rates".
The U.S. economy is doing relatively well, and the process of economic recovery is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and creating a small amount of inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less promising global picture.
Markets have warned against a rally, but there are signs that they believe it will not be possible.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8:00.
The killer at Delta State University left an apology note.
Authorities said Tuesday that Shannon Lamb left a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder after shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning and before killing his co-worker later that day, wishing he could take it back.
Mississippi Gautier Police say Lamb, a geography and social studies instructor at Delta State University, called 911 at 10:00 a.m.
Monday and said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the officer on the phone to send the police.
"I killed my wife last night", Lamb said, adding that he had "a sweet dog that never hurt anyone" in the house and was probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't say.
Lamb didn't make any explanation about the murder.
When police arrived on the scene, they found the lifeless body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a note written by Lamb, 45, that said: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could turn back time.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only person who ever loved me.
Lamb drove to Delta State, 300 miles away, after writing this note, and killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, then committed suicide when he was cornered by police.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it was obvious that Lamb had something in mind".
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed his girlfriend Prentiss was also having an emotional relationship with Schmidt, on Tuesday authorities said they had "no information or evidence" that it was a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as "a good person".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, and she was "devastated".
O'Steen also noted that Prentiss and her daughter were "definitely best friends".
Linsday Knowless, described by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Parentiss, said Prentiss was working from home on the internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owns a hunting dog named Lightning, has been with Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "He always liked to help others".
Police say Lamb called his family on Monday and said he wasn't going to jail.
That night, when police approached him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped on foot, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
According to his CV posted on the university's website, Lamb earned a doctorate in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their charm
The actor (left) seen with his son Redmond (right) has spent several years under a lot of stress.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his life partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor, who is also said to have struggled with drugs, was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All of this hurt him, of course.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been out for months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered two fractures to his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
The incident, which has left the defender in tears, will keep him out of the field for at least six months, and he remains hopeful that Louis van Gaal Shaw can return to the field this season.
The break was caused by 20-year-old Shaw's reckless attack on Hector Moreno in the 15th minute of the game, which landed him on the field like a bomb.
He was on the field for nine minutes, and then needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a broken ankle and is in hospital".
Today or the next day, maybe he'll be transferred and operated on in Manchester.
It's a terrible situation - a young man who transfers to Manchester at 18, first has a rough time, then a great game, and then this happens to him.
When he was in the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on his face.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a fracture in your hip, it's at least six months and means you can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get away with a red card and a penalty.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official made a mistake.
When I say it's a penalty and a red card, you can judge for yourself.
It was a bad fight with two legs.
Shaw tweeted on his account: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how disappointed I am, my recovery journey is now beginning, I will return stronger".
Luke Shaw is in shock from his injury in the Manchester United PSV loss.
The Champions League in France next July will be a boost for the English defender's recovery.
PSV technical director Phillip Cocu said: "It's a very bad injury".
If an injury like this happens to any player, it's a sad day for everyone.
Our players never intend to injure their opponent.
Moreno also suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
Cocu said he found it very difficult because he never intended to injure his opponent and it didn't get any better after hearing that it was a very bad fracture.
I couldn't see the moment from my perspective.
All I could see was a ball going the other way, like Moreno touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's play.
Speaking to SBS 6, Moreno said: "I know what it feels like.
I feel really bad about it, and I'm really sorry.
He was taken to hospital after a fight with PSV's Andrés Guardado against Chris Smalling.
Of course David Cameron knows more about The Lorax than that?
This is something every parent learns in a short time: When your child loves a book, you know it won't take long to learn it almost by heart.
It seems that if you are not David Cameron.
When asked by a holiday programming supplier for childcare what her favorite children's book was, the prime minister chose The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fairy tale by Dr. Seuss.
In a message posted on the SuperCamps website, Cameron said that this was a difficult decision: "I love reading this book to my children because it has a funny, moving, creative and powerful message, and it contains an image or message that we always skip".
So far, everything's going well, until Cameron supposedly writes something about the contents of the book, but actually adds new characters and details to inflate the contents of the original story, which is summarized in the 2012 film version of the book.
In Thneed-Ville, a walled city where all nature has vanished and even the air is commodity, a boy named Ted wants to fulfill his dream of seeing a real tree to win the heart of his dream girl Audrey, writes the author, who incorporates a love story that Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, did not know.
If that didn't strike you as suspicious enough, the text Cameron deals with is in some ways very similar to the short synopsis of The Lora at the Internet Film Archive, which begins: "In Thneed-Ville, a walled town where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted wants to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his childhood dreams".
Given his claims of being a devoted parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron was unaware of the main theme of the book in which he heard an unnamed young boy's local environment being destroyed by the greedy, tree-cutting, weeping Once, despite the objections of the bald, mustachioed creature called the Lorax, who gave the book its name.
It's likely that a PR job this weak was assigned to a valet who apparently never read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokeswoman for the presidency said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but he made no comment beyond that.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of expulsion from England, but he's still intact.
Playing Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but after seeing the England team selected for the tour, I don't think a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat last time is in the cards.
Still, I'm not ruling out a transfer win.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but he has players who have a good comeback on the batting line and a strong sense of collective play, which does not heal the wounds of 2012, but only provides a little youthful optimism.
In the batting, Moeen Ali is developing as a wicket-keeper and Adil Rashid represents an attacking option even though his quality at Test level is unknown.
Adam Lyth has left the England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to remove Adam Lyth is a difficult one for me as head coach at Yorkshire to analyse.
The Seven Tests were against two good batsmen in difficult conditions and the simple but inescapable truth is that cricketers are judged by the results.
For example, there was no question mark about Joe Root, it had to be announced because, as I said before, the players were their best options.
After a few fifty-odd issues, Lyth could see his career stretch, but he decided his own destiny.
I hope he gets another chance if he works more for Yorkshire.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player's attitude, which didn't surprise me, even though he didn't perform at his best; he's a team man after all.
It's hard to say how long it'll take a batting champion to get a score.
Lyth - like Sam Robson before him - took seven caps, while Nick Compton took nine.
Compton is the only one who's got a rematch.
The only pain you can feel for Jonathan Trott is that England will be the first to go to the Caribbean - when Lyth's form is at its peak - but that wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a top-notch hitter to me.
He's an X-factor cricketer, and we saw that earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, in Yorkshire.
He should be able to get at least the same opportunity as before, but that depends, of course, on the team formation in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen opening with Cook to get an extra game-winner while holding four quick ones worked, and I'm not against it.
I don't see why a batsman can't hit here, and this left-hander has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them and it doesn't make much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests in his first fall before he started his 2001 outing.
He grabbed the three hundred and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a substitute pitcher and in my limited interviews with him, he has surprised me as an impressive young man.
People can look at his raw stats -- 31 batting average and 35 on the mound -- and think it's a dump, but there aren't many game-changers who raise their hands, and the player selections are made since he was young.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, it seems England have made some clever additions to their coaching staff.
It may be a clever move to appoint Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a Test match adviser.
He's one of the most lovable men in the game, and he'll bring a wealth of experience to bear against any and all odds.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white ball foot and adds a brutal run to both the energy and the game.
I always thought he was born for the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and he has a sense of direction like Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even messages that were said before, can bring something new to the team.
Colly's team-mate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is on a one-day break, Root has been given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, plans aren't made by coaches and players.
And you have to remember, like the players, their work depends on the results.
Decisions like this are never easy.
If the economy stagnates until 2017, the Brexit camp could win
David Cameron's half-baked re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and this is despite Jeremy Corbyn's "Yes or No?" election as Labour leader or the TUC's rampage over Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A friend of mine, a European diplomat, recently said that some member states are tired of the British agenda of divisive privileges and self-serving treaty changes, in an EU that is mired in a variety of crises that are entirely not their fault, many of which they do not want.
The TUC decided at its annual meeting in Brighton that it did not want them if they were to harm social protection.
You might even call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, pose for pictures of themselves in front of famous monuments, whether they are leaders or not, and then go back to their countries and say they are gathering allies for reform.
This is all about me.
When Berlin said, "Don't leave us alone with France", my European friend in the EU tent, who wants an outward-looking Britain, pointed out that there is a growing myopicism in some capitals and that the authorities are no longer concerned about us staying or not.
Germany's cautious and sane chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, yet she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before things get worse, as in the cases of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande faces re-election or a change of power in France in 2017.
It's a fading force.
Soon a right-wing nationalist government will come to power in Poland, and a left-wing government in Spain.
It's unlikely that these countries will make an effort for the Selfie Britons, who should be using their energy to prevent Scotland from breaking away from the United Kingdom, because they don't want to because most of them have separatist leanings.
So some of these ministers, like the Scottish National Party, may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements during the 2017 UK referendum campaign that will not help this situation, my friend says.
"There was no way to renegotiate" and "Britain got nothing to gain from renegotiating".
Europeans know from their past experience how exploitative, how anti-EU the oligarchic press barons of Fleet Street were because they were not so in the time of Tony Benn, who inspired the 1975 referendum that approved our entry in 1973 by a two to one margin.
That's how they remember Boris Johnson, the head of the Euro-opportunist, who was a Brussels correspondent in the early '90s, known as the "EU flat bananas".
All the nonsense aside, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included tax-defying thugs, illegal phone tapping foreigners and so-called foreign residents who owned most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair, in fact, often thought the same thing about this, except that when a horny gorilla was trapped in a cage, he realized that he needed to distract it by giving it bananas for lunch and then tea to avoid eating.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in his opposition to Cameron's brilliant referendum idea, as Blair had compromised on principle on the EU constitution, which was repealed in 2005 by the French and Dutch voters who gave him the exit card.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who patted my back in Westminster on Monday - and I told him he had no time to lose to me - seems in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's then and now flawed 1980s strategy of boycotting Murdoch.
It will take time, but he needs to develop a consistent strategy to communicate with the media, not me, especially with Andrew Marr, who will be leaving the BBC chair on Sunday.
I'm saying Corbyn's official position in Europe is gently evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most people who are outside the UKIP hostile bias and the ardent supporters of Conservative Little England say yes.
And that's what Hilary Benn, who is a Benn but not a Bennite, said on radio and television this week, because she naively forced herself to not accept that it was a bad idea for Corbyn to appoint John McDonnell as shadow chancellor.
It reminded me of his father's struggle on television in the 1970s to disloyalty to his colleagues in the workers' cabinet, not going far enough and losing his cabinet post.
Hilary's struggle was more appealing.
But in Benn's words, fighting to stay "at all costs" was not the same as what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to the Lords to the MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
And considering that it touches me, the detail that Corbyn is trying to convey, whatever the glitzy image, it still maintains its message discipline in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the social media whirlpool that is a bed of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it makes sense to make a difficult case for Europe, which would guarantee Cameron the support of the Labour Party in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's transition to EU membership, in keeping with their Bennite background in the economy of siege and anti-capitalist, is no longer a particular debate among left-wing opponents, where narcissism of small differences is just one of the cornerstones of the doctrinal rhetoric.
As with his passage on NATO - Tom Watson is determined that JC will not campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will have to try to make sense of it for their masters back home.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital on concessions to Britain when they have skeptical voters of their own?
As I was told at the opening of the British Impact Security Forum on Monday, the US is already disappointed by the British underperformance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the cost-cutting Conservative government in power.
Experts criticize the UK public health e-cigarette research
Researchers told a 12-person meeting of people with ties to the tobacco industry, conducted by a government-funded agency, that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released its "tipping point" report last month, which it described as "a detailed examination of the evidence".
But some researchers questioned the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month's Lancet medical journal headline targeted "extraordinary foundation of decay" based on PHE's main finding.
Two other researchers, writing in the BMJ, questioned whether the claims were "built on sand or rock".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of effectiveness".
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking, according to the best available estimate", to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this stems from a meeting of 12 people who came together to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms of different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting, the general manager, was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which had previously reportedly received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent investigation.
They also said that he approved BAT's public health promotional document in a sustainability report.
They added that one of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but this was not the previously reported funding received from Philip Morris International cigarette company.
No details were given on how the panelists were selected, but they included some of the known giants of e-cigarettes, some of whom the article reported as industry funds.
Some other attendees are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The person in charge of tobacco at PHE was also present.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the research paper the group wrote "effectively" admitted that it lacked "concrete evidence of harmfulness of most products by many criteria".
However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said that claims that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers" are too early.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been answered earlier.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers dies from the addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear mission: to educate the public about what the evidence shows and what it doesn't show, especially at a time when there is so much confusion about the harm of tobacco compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
We are fulfilling our national responsibility to make clear the existing evidence - that e-cigarettes, while not risk-free, only carry a small fraction of the harm caused by smoking - that is being exposed.
The former head of Channel 4 said the BBC should leave EastEnders.
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and noted that its advertising competitors could "give their right arm" to hit programmes such as the Albert Square series.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make programmes of the kind not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes on channels like BBC4 that were likely to be watched by a smaller audience, versus programmes that received the highest ratings of their competitors at valuable intervals.
After Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, said the organisation wanted to collaborate more with other organisations, Johnson said that this had been tried unsuccessfully for six years in his time at Channel 4 to establish a link with the BBC.
Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee during a question about the future of the BBC: "I am opposed to the idea of the BBC ordering and broadcasting programmes that can be shown by clearly unsubsidised competitors".
If you continue to use the license fee, which I'm not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, then at least the output should be reduced to programs that others don't make or order.
They're running The Voice in prime time because they want to provide as much support as possible for my future.
The whole idea here is based on the idea that no one else will publish, which is ridiculous and frankly nonsense.
"I don't see why programs that can be funded without aid should be funded by a reduced tax rate", Johnson said.
The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, and it's actually done in-house.
To be honest, the other networks would give their right arm for that.
I'm trying to see how public service broadcasts are.
I don't think it's going to diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, blamed the BBC for chasing ratings "because of the passion of the people who work here and because these employees see this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support".
His comments about the BBC's most popular programmes echo those of Tony Ball, the former Sky presenter who used a MacTaggart class in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest the BBC sell its programmes such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programmes went to BBC4 and that there could be no audience measurement here but that they were tax-exempt and could be discussed to continue their show-piety duties of providing ground for £4 billion in licence fee revenue, adding: "We do all these slick programmes that of course nobody watches".
They put them in the gaps where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I would urge you to find a more regressive system for those who would benefit most from it.
Now, of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is a lot of money, but I wonder if for people where £150 is a lot of money, why would they do that if they don't watch a lot of BBC?
David Elstein, the former Sky and Channel 5 administrator who also presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC needed to revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that some of the BBC's output was now officially classified as education - that was 1% of TV output and 0.1% of radio output - and that public service broadcasting in Australia and Canada should be at the forefront of this and that this should be replaced by "information, enlightenment and education".
On partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do something about proms that are only shown on TV and partner with advertisers to ensure they are all seen online.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows how the threadworms change direction as soon as they are hit by the sound vibrations.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically engineered nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny threadworms change direction as soon as they're hit by sound vibrations that humans can't hear.
The vibrations are triggered by activating motor nerve cells that have been genetically engineered to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers read and record brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms proved the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, which allows ultrasound to be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical vibrations into people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms.
Fibreworms don't usually respond to sound beyond their own, but Chalasani found that they do when surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he found amplify the ultrasonic waves, allowing the worms to pass through.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
According to a report in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To create ultrasonically controlled threadworms, Chalasani genetically engineered the worms to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the micro-shells and transmitted into the worms, where they activated the modified motor neurons.
This procedure has similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that must be sent through an optical fiber to a desired point in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unimpeded and thus be sent through the skull into the brain.
Chalasani said, "We believe that by using gene therapy and a curative virus, human neurons targeted in a clinical setting for specific neurological treatments can be temporarily made sensitive to the ultrasound signal".
He added that other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment-- right on your doorstep!
The ads are blaming the British arms trade.
Watch the video of the Amnesty International anti-gun fair.
The dreaded killer drones!
The cuffs that break your ankle!
The particle hit bombs!
And electric shocks that cause severe pain but leave no trace!
The fine audio and cartoon footage produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's desire to sell arms to oppressive regimes through the ExCel Centre for Defence and Security Equipment International in London Harbour leaves no doubt that the world's largest arms fair is a blatant fraud.

But a different campaign is going on with posters at bus stops and subway trains that require a second look.
One, using London Underground fonts and branding, turns the DLR line into a tank and says, "Important announcement, will you be traveling on the DLR between September 15 and 18?"
This September, a gang of arms dealers are going to attack the DLR... asking customers to help stop this arms fair.
300 posters from artists who exhibit at Bansky's Museum of Cruel Design in Dismalland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it using "Blow to Advertising Space Packages", which cost £6 and claimed to "give access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet".
Transport for London was not happy with the "vandalism" of this poster.
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol Group collective.
Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a faculty member at the University of Essex, says artists are becoming more questionable every day and are looking for ways to take political work outside the gallery to the masses.
Many artists are moving with activists in protest movements and they're starting to realize that they need to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun poster is also showing up on the subway.
The video of Amnesty International was viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook within 24 hours and was created by the free-working advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and sound artist also produced it for free.
Matt Lever, creative director of the VCCP, was surprised by the silence over gun shows - with a blank space in the Excel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic, subtle corporate ad, but "decorated with bright colors and animation, it became more eye-catching".
"They helped us a lot to raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair", said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is for the British government to act and stop the illegal sale of torture equipment on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art at the gun show comes from ExCeL inside, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover products.
In a press release, Saab showed the US military's order for "AT4CS RS launched from our shoulder".
It has a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers a powerful blow through the armor to the target".
Whatever he's doing, it's not gonna be pretty.
Eight golden rules for living in a dorm
It's been 11 years since I moved into a dorm as an uncaring 19-year-old, and I still believe in fairy tales and moral relativity, but now I remember the fake smiles of those who bothered me -- and their countless complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be summed up in eight golden rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from annoying to downright terrifying.
The seductiveness of gossip: telling people where it came from, whether it was a waste of years, where it insisted on Corbyn and why you "obviously don't like or hate Marmite because really, guys, it's just yeast extract HAHAHAHA I'll be in my room".
Take a breath. I need you to breathe.
And let the others have one -- ask questions and show relevance.
It will guide the conversation and help you distinguish what you like from what you don't like from people who may be on fire or who may be pulling on a fire extinguisher.
Give people some space.
People's rooms often become reception areas, movie night venues, and social gathering places, but they are also places where people dress and arrange their underwear.
Related: Don 't even think about starting a relationship with a college
Insiders get treated badly at the university.
Your room may be a place of seclusion, but many dorm hallways foster a culture of interroom hanging out that is open to sociable, social, lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone trying to store energy.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want to keep this friendship going, but I need you to go away for a while so I can make up for the energy I've spent communicating with you".
If your friend is tired of socializing, try to sense it and perhaps text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A friend of mine in the dorm had a policy that if the door wasn't locked, he was allowed in.
He's seen a lot.
Don't make friends by cooking.
Since you started college at the height of the food-competition craze, it's less weird to introduce yourself by knocking on people's doors with a plate of brownies, and it's less like the 1950s, "Welcome to our neighborhood, I cooked you something, now I'll smile when you ask personal questions".
Giving people homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk and perhaps associate your face with a sweet surprise.
Well, obviously, it's about you being a master cook.
A good-tasting dough, sugar and butter will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Well, obviously, scratching someone's chicken is stealing, but getting a few drops of milk for your tea is stealing?
Double-check the milkman.
Even if he's swimming in it, he'll probably tell you to take care of yourself.
It's very uncomfortable for someone to steal your stuff, and I understand you, but try to handle it more maturely than my roommate, who put liquid soap on the floor to punish the person who stole your milk.
He's in prison now.
Don't make noise that will keep people from sleeping or studying.
Not just because you're a decent person, but because you're Einsteins in glass houses.
A girl in my hallway told her neighbor next door to press down and slow down the drums because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had a test in the morning.
Their response was to raise their voice.
When they finally closed at 5 a.m., she played her last music and locked the door, gently allowing them to sleep for two hours before leaving for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife moved into the same hallway as you?
Wouldn't it be weird if you misunderstood a hallway friend and thought she was your future wife, and you hung out and left and had to see her every day and watch your roommates get captured?
Of course it's heart, but if your hot hallway neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, at least talk to the little guy and give him some common sense.
When you're in a happy moment and you notice someone leaving their keys inside without locking the door, the line between being funny and being cruel is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to come back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson in safety by hiding their stuff - but never dirty someone's room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in a glass of water in the freezer, but don't stick your stuff to the ceiling more than twice.

Police are investigating whether the drug she used daily, called "Potenay", played a role in her death.
The real cause of death will be revealed after the autopsy.

Oil companies are officially bankrupt.
Since 2014 when oil prices started to fall, nearly $400 billion in investment has been put on hold until the end of last year, with most deepwater oil exploration projects suspended.
According to research by consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have caused the suspension of $380 billion in oil and gas exploration/production projects, while also delaying millions of barrels of production across a wide geographic area from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa.
The report, which highlights the biggest reason for the cost cuts as oil prices dropped 70 percent in 1.5 years to their lowest level in 12 years from $115 in the summer of 2014, says "Company budgets have narrowed dramatically".
$ 400 billion in the bank .
With crude oil prices surprisingly high every day, they've recently dropped below $30 to their lowest level in 12 years.
With the debate raging over whether gasoline should be cheaper than water, a study by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie shows how the industry is being affected by falling prices.
In his latest report, published in July, Wood Mackenzie reveals that falling oil prices have caused 46 major energy investments worth $200 billion to be suspended, and his new research reveals where that number is by the end of 2015.
According to this, in the last six months of 2015, 22 other major projects were postponed, while a total of 68 major projects have been suspended since 2014 when the oil slump began.
These projects are worth about $400 billion.
2.9 million cases a day
The study, which highlighted the "harsh" impact of low oil prices on company plans, said deep-sea development projects were the projects most affected.
The suspended projects represent a total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent reserves, thus delaying production of 2.9 million barrels of oil per day until 2025.
According to the study, the final investment decision of most of the projects in question was postponed to 2017 and beyond, while the first production targets were shifted between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 projects that have been postponed, the report highlights a potential investment of $170 billion over the next five years, "most of which is deep-sea projects".
And that's because the upfront cost is so high.
"70 percent of deep-sea spending is also accounted for by oil-intensive projects in Nigeria, Angola and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico", it says.
According to the study, the countries with the most oil project inventories are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of the deferred oil reserves.
The countries with the largest deferred gas reserves are Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, which together account for 85 percent of the total.
While much of the natural gas waiting to come out here is in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions like building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant from scratch.
The companies most at risk are oil giants with successive commitments in the deep sea, Canadian oil sands and Caspian region, while companies are also said to be trying to adapt to a "longer, lower" oil price scenario.
The eyes in Iran
Not so long ago, four years ago, the picture was that the United States and Europe had imposed an embargo on Iranian oil to stop Tehran's nuclear program, oil was about $110 a barrel, and there was a debate about how to cut Iranian oil exports without causing a sudden spike in prices.
And when we come back this week, we see a very different scenario.
Oil prices have fallen below $30 for the first time since 2004, largely due to the explosion in production in the United States and the lifting of the embargo on Iran.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, more oil will flow into the oil market, which is already said to be quite saturated.
And that could cause prices to drop below the levels that surprised us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, which does not want to lose market share to Iran, will pump more oil and a price war between Iran and Saudi Arabia could occur.
As soon as the sanctions are lifted, Iran's main target is reportedly its former partners in Asia's fast-growing oil market, India and Europe.
Iranian officials had previously said they would initially increase exports to 500,000 barrels per day and aim to bring that number to market in the future.
According to Reuters' map information, 22 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) are waiting in Iranian waters, at least 13 of which are fully or heavily loaded.
Iran has the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the world.
Thanks to sanctions exemptions, Iran is still exporting about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Before the sanctions, Iran's daily oil exports had risen to 3 million barrels a day.
Aysun Göksu, a specialist in support securities research, answers the question of whether oil will fall below $20, saying: "Global growth concerns centered in China are increasing downward pressure on commodity prices, while the loss in oil prices is deepening".
In China, the world's biggest oil importer, we've seen losses of up to 20 percent since Christmas, with concerns that oil demand will decline in parallel with the economic slowdown.
Additionally, with the global appreciation of the dollar and the global oversupply problem, we may see oil prices below $30 in the coming days.
Unless we see a sustained price increase above $32 to $33 levels, the upward movement in oil may remain limited and downward pressure may increase.
At this point, closing below the critical $30 level is arguably a key factor in keeping the declines going.
It should come as no surprise that the lows are continuing down to the 23:30-25.60 support zone.
Isham Sardouk: 'The age of the angel is over!'
Why did you take the route to Turkey when you were the fashion designer for Victoria's Secret and WGSN, the fashion house that sets the world on fire?
- I'm always for change.
I was born in Paris, lived in London, then went to New York.
I've held important positions there.
Meanwhile, I've been consulting Cotton for the past two years.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and the Cotton brand.
I realized that in the age of the earth, you have everything you need to be a chain store.
And now I'm here to make that happen.
Can you do it in a short time?
- I'm sure you are.
Although it's a young brand, it's already sold in 50 countries.
We release 50 collections a year, 15 different sections.
So it's got everything a chain store should have.
We can meet the needs of consumers in different geographies from Dubai to Moscow.
Now we're opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era...
Do you have to open a shop in Paris?
- I know.
It's not because Europe's economic situation is great.
But you open some stores for image.
You have a shop in fashion capitals like Paris, London, you make money in the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, both essential for a brand that plays to the global.
So let's talk about the trends.
- We have a very romantic, stylish season ahead of us.
Flying chiffon dresses, soft tones, pink, white, red.
The patterns...
We are living through very difficult and cruel times, and the fashion world is always trying to bring a little happiness to life by bringing stylish, revealing designs to the podium during these difficult times.
That's what we do.
That's why the new season is back to the "golden age".
Let's go back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
I'm not just talking about her gorgeous physique, she's so positive, so good.
He would sit next to me while I worked, and he would feed me apples and stuff, like, "Honey, are you hungry?"
I mean, he was so sweet.
You know what I'm talking about, because I did my research and you interviewed all the Victoria's Secret models.
How beautiful was Caroline?
But Adriana Lima was also very impressive with her beauty.
- Oh, yeah, that voice!
That speech, that tone...
You're gonna pull the trigger and say, "Sit back and look good, and don't do anything else".
It's annoying.
Right, that's the kind of shock you get.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen, but I was terrified of her hollow head.
- Most of them are now.
The new angels aren't like the old ones...
I remember the Gisele days.
Although, he was a tough guy to work with.
He came backstage, smoking like a cigarette.
It's not that it's a turkey.
Nobody can drink, he can drink!
The point is to be a diva.
The Victoria's Secret fashion show that premiered two months ago has the lowest ratings in history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, the days of the legendary beautiful angels are over.
I'm sorry, who would want Gigi Hadid?
What's good about it?
Kendall Jenner, for example, is like a piece of wood...
No curves, nothing at all.
Kate Moss has zero curves, but she's become the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how beautiful was her face?
I'd like to exercise my right to object here.
I interviewed her last year, and she was pretty down...
- All that smoking, drinking, now it's ugly.
But she had such a pretty face in her 90s.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
She was at the end of her supermodel days.
It's like the days of Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, and all that.
Christy was my next-door neighbor, and I'd see her every morning without makeup on.
Such beauty, such elegance, cannot be.
What about Cara Delevingne?
- He's wasting himself.
Not every campaign.
People are getting tired.
There's no hunger for models and celebrities like there used to be.
People like to see their real faces on the campaign trail.
We're going to go after that.
Because it's the trend.
Letter from 25 writers from Turkey
Writers, including presidents of the International Writers Union (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, said threats and physical attacks targeting colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life.
The letter also mentioned the two attacks on the Hürriyet newspaper in Turkey, the raid by the Koza group and the detention of Vice News reporters, as well as investigations and arrests of journalists.
Mother's right to work half-time is a matter of debate.
"We believe that mothers are given the right to work half-time so that the rented work can be restored".
"This could be a Trojan horse", TISK said, "We are concerned that this regulation in favor of women will prevent women from working".
The new rights that are planned to be brought to the employees of the civil service and the workers after birth or adoption passed the commission with talks that lasted all day.
The most frequent topic in the committee discussions was "hired labour" for the provisions that provide for six months of part-time work after birth or unpaid leave, and the possibility of part-time work until the child reaches primary school age.
CHP Izmir MP Musa Çam, who said it was right to have the child work part-time until he goes to primary school, but expressed some concerns, said, "If you bring in hired labor after this, we will be up to the end".
Enis Bağdadioğlu, who participated in the Commission's talks on behalf of Türk-İş, expressed similar concerns, saying, "We have doubts about how the place of female employees in part-time work will be filled".
"We will be following developments in the private employment bureaus with concern", Baghdadioglu said, adding that if hiring comes up again, new problems will arise that will go beyond outsourcing.
TISK Secretary General Bülent Pirler said that the law introduced a five-year period of part-time work.
Look at it this way.
"Where there are 1 or 2 employees, you have to think about the consequences of this practice", he said.
Ahmet Şagar, the TOBB advisor, said that if the application is implemented, there will be difficulties in finding workers.
Shagar said that there is no legislation on the rules to be applied in part-time work, "When there is a regulation on special employment bureaus, a compromise should be made between the employee and the employer".
We are not supporting this.
Feyzioğlu's explanation is: "We do not agree with this declaration, we cannot participate and support it".
Because there's not a single sentence of criticism of the PKK.
You didn't say a single negative word to the PKK, the divisive terrorist organization, you didn't dust it.
The heavy statements made only and only against the state, we do not take seriously and do not find sincere considering who made them.
We are lawyers, we are lawyers.
If there is any illegal behavior by state representatives, public officials, security forces in this context, we will follow it.
When we say to the remnants of the apartheid era, who look sympathetically at the dividers or the dividers, who romanticize them, "Don't destroy the state", they attack us as "Divisors, fascists".
When we say, "This government should follow the law, always uphold the law", they say, "You're causing division".
We are the bridge.
We are people who are obligated to tell the truth at all times.

Who is Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name is Belgian Sarılmışer, was born on July 16, 1960 in Mersin.
After her parents divorced, she moved to Ankara with her mother Sebahat Çakır in 1966.
After Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Primary School, she entered the piano department of Ankara State Conservatory, but left due to financial difficulties and worked for a while in PTT.
In 1979, she accepted an offer to work at the Feyman Nightclub, where she had gone to party with friends.
At the Feyman Night Club, he performed with the Lokomotiv Group Orchestra with repertoires of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and the fashionable arrangements of the time.
Bergen, who went to Adana for work after Ankara, met Halis Serbes there and married a year later.
In 1982, she released her first longplay from Atlas Plak, "I Have a Complaint".
Bergen, who could not stand the violence of her husband as she continued her artistic career, ran away from her many times.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, she was beaten in the face at the insistence of her husband.
Bergen, who lost one eye and burned a large part of her body in the attack, was persuaded to perform by Cengiz Özşeker, the composer of the song "Kimbilir?" that made Kibariye famous after the treatment.
The artist, who performed at the Izmir Pırlanta Pavilion, which was owned by Özşeker until 1985, together with his boss made a demo tape called "Brotherless Fate" and sent it to Yaşar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist, who released his first professional longplay in the Istanbul music market, "Insans Severse", under the musical direction of Burhan Bayar, gained fame with "Acıların Kadını" towards the end of 1986.
The album was well received and in April 1987 she was awarded the title of "Best Selling Arabesque Female Artist of 1986" by the record company with a Gold Record and a Gold Cassette.
In the same year, she appeared in the film "Acıların Kadını" with the script and direction of Ülkü Erakalın, along with Yalçın Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron.
Bergen, who has a huge fan base, survived a knife attack in Adana where she was attending a concert.
The artist, who left the stage at a certain time, released the albums "Onu da Yak Tanrım", "Sevgimin bedeli" and "I don't want" under the direction of the great masters Selami Shaahin, Özer Şenay and Cengiz Tekin.
Bergen, who was also officially divorced from her husband in April 1989, made her return to the stage in June 1989 with her last album while alive, Years Don't Forgive.
The artist, who began touring to promote the album, was shot dead by his divorced wife in Adana Pozantı on the night of August 14, 1989.
He was buried in his hometown of Mersin.
Bergen has recorded 129 songs in 5 long plays and 11 cassettes, and a video film in his short life of 29 years.
The claims about the legendary artist who signed the arabesque with a different and powerful voice, became true with the first day of the album "Giden Gençliğim" released after his death.
Bergen's official released studio albums:
1982 - Complaint I Have LP (reissued as MC in 1986)
1983 - Brotherhood of Kader LP (reissued as MC in 1985 and 1990).

Nazım Hikmet was commemorated on his 114th birthday
Nazım Hikmet Ran, known as the country poet, was commemorated in his 114th year with the event "Ingi ki Borndun Nazım".
The event was organized by the Konak Municipality in the Güzelyalı Cultural Center in the hall named after the poet.
The event included poetry and music listening and the poems of the famous poet were sung by theater and cinema actor Rüştü Asiyalı.
The Three Anatolian Music Society also accompanied Asialy with their comments.
Nazım Hikmet was accompanied by many art lovers.
These names included Ali Seçkiner Alıcı, Erkoç Torun, Nedim Yıldız and Zeynep Göknur Yıldız and Ziya Özsökmenler.
In Istanbul, an event was organized by the Nazım Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation.
The foundation's chairman Rutkay Aziz and members, daughter, son-in-law and grandson of Nazim Hikmet's wife Vera Tulyakova, actress Tarik Akan, gathered in Tarabya for the event.
"Living alone and free as a tree, and to his sister as a forest", he will sing and drop carnations into the sea.
The event, which is organized with the contributions of the Municipality of Sarıyer, will be accompanied by the Nizam Hikmet Choir.
Nazım Hikmet was born on January 15, 1902.
The poems of the world famous poet Nazım Hikmet have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He was repeatedly arrested for his political views and spent much of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poetry has been translated into more than fifty languages and his work has received many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
Bursa Nilüfer Municipality has organized special works for the 114th birthday of world famous poet Nazım Hikmet.
The municipality, which is working on a documentary about Nazım's 11 years in Bursa Prison, also issued a personal stamp for the poet for the first time in Turkish history.
Thus, with the cooperation of PTT, the first personal stamp in the history of Turkey was issued in the name of Nazım Hikmet.
The stamp and the envelope will be given to guests on Thursday, January 14 at the Nazım Hikmet Culture Center.
They're gonna be deported on bicycles.
But with no deal between the two countries, the refugees, most of them Syrians, will have to pedal back to Russia this time, in minus 20 degrees.
In the summer, a group of refugees flew to Russia, where it was safer and cheaper, and then through the north of the country, through Murmansk to Norway.
The migrants crossed the border by bicycle because the agreement between the two countries did not allow them to cross the border on foot.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
So the Norwegian police ordered the bicycles to be repaired after they were left behind.
"Turkey to 3 billion euros" crisis in the EU
THE crisis over the €3 billion pledged to Turkey for refugees is ongoing.
European Union Commission President Jean Claude Juncker has criticized Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for blocking the transfer of funds to Turkey.
Juncker said the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe was not good and that the EU had to find 3 billion euros.
Juncker said, "This money is not for Turkey, it's for Syrian refugees in Turkey".
We're not even close to $3 billion.
"This is a matter of EU credibility, and therefore important", he said.
Juncker said he expected the money to be completed by the previously set date of January 26.
Italy is among the countries that have been noted for their positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources are of the opinion that Rome's stance on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey and is connected to problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some union countries.
There's been tension between Italy and the EU for some time.
Renzi continued to harshly criticize German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU during and after the last EU summit on energy, banking and migration.
Juncker, who criticized Renzi's attitude at yesterday's press conference, said: "Renzi should stop blaming the EU".
"It is wrong for Renzi, who I love very much, to insult the EU Commission at every opportunity".
Juncker implied that Renzi was playing into the public's interest.
Of the 3 billion euros promised to Turkey, 1 billion will be met from the EU budget.
The other 2 billion euros will come from the member states' budgets.
Germany will contribute at least 427 million euros.
The Greek government, which announced that it would not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, decided to transfer its share of 2.3 million euros to the EU budget to be used to support Jordan and Lebanon.
The resource is planned to be used in the period 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw the Chalie Hebdo cartoon.
Speaking to the Russian official news agency Sputnik, father Abdullah Kurdi reacted harshly, saying, "I cried over this cartoon, if you want to be honest".
"I felt so bad", she said.
Expecting positive things from Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine that has become a symbol of freedom of expression following the armed attack, Father Kurdi said:
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everyone was very upset about that cartoon.
Aylan is a two-year-old boy and he's dead.
Aylan, me and my family should have been treated with respect by Charlie Hebdo, but it was the other way around.
This magazine is supposed to show respect for people.
They've published a disrespectful caricature of the Prophet.
They even made books about God.
It's a small thing to do to my child in the sight of Allah and the Prophet.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbil, called on the world and the humor magazine to respect all the children who died.
He must not upset their families, add pain to their suffering.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt, Tima Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was also one of the people who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, autographed cartoonist, has a hint that 3-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, who dumped his lifeless body on the beach in Bodrum, could grow up to be one of the bullies in Germany.
Last year, French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo, which was attacked by radical religious extremists who killed 12 people for publishing cartoons of Muhammad, was again the focus of controversy for its cartoon about Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicted harassers chasing women with pig faces and recalling immigrants, as in the case of the harassment of women during the Christmas celebrations in Cologne, Germany.
The cartoon that caused a lot of different reactions on social media is actually part of a four-square column.
It reads "This is not France" and many readings criticize the growing hostility to refugees, along with other values that are lost to France.
The cartoon, however, has led many to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Charlie Hebdo magazine praised Germany for accepting 800,000 refugees in a number published last year, while criticizing France's reluctance to open its doors to migrants.
The cartoon said, "He was so close to his goal", while the billboard said, "Two kids' menus for one price".
'Autopsies for Germans killed in Sultanahmet in Germany'
According to a report on the website of the weekly Der Spiegel, the German Federal Prosecutor's Office has decided to bring the bodies of the 10 people who died in the attack to Germany.
The bodies of the dead will be flown to the country today or tomorrow by a German Air Force plane and will be received at the airport with a ceremony.
In Germany, experts from the Identification Commission of the Federal Criminal Court (BKA), which conducts forensic procedures, normally travel to the countries where the accident or attack occurred for identification and autopsies of German citizens who died in the accident or attack.
But Der Spiegel magazine said that this time it would be different.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Directorate appealed to Turkish authorities to have the identification and autopsy of the dead done in Istanbul, but the Turkish authorities did not accept this proposal.
The Federal Criminal Bureau sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are being treated in hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has died.
Meiksins Wood, a prominent political theorist and socialist historian, was particularly remembered for his important work on the origins of capitalism.
Meiksins Wood, born in New York in 1942, of Latvian origin, whose works have also been published in Turkish are: Escape from Class -- The Archaic Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- The Origin of Capitalism -- The Empire of Capital -- A Return to Marx
Refugees men are banned from swimming in the pool
The news in the German press says that if the social workers in the home report that the message of the ban was understood by the refugees, the municipality will lift the ban.
Markus Schnapka, a social worker who told WDR that the municipality did not want to punish the innocent for the behavior of several people, said that they informed the residents of the dormitories in three languages about the values that matter in Germany.
Schnapka noted that they do not discuss the value of gender equality that Germany values, adding that the municipality will punish any kind of attack and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival parade in Rheinberg was canceled due to the possibility of harassment scandals in Cologne being experienced in the upcoming carnival parades.
The city announced that the carnival parade was canceled because there was no guarantee that there would be no harassment.
What are the benefits of steaming?
Steaming, a technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals in foods, is becoming increasingly popular.
Steam cooking, a popular cooking technique in the Far East for centuries, promotes metabolism and facilitates digestion.
This method, which eliminates problems like indigestion, also kills bacteria and microbes in food completely.
Protein, cellulose, and starch in food are completely dissolved by this technique, making the food softer.
Low pressure steaming is done in a pot with the help of steam pots or a steam machine.
High pressure cooking uses little water and takes little time.
The best example of this is cooking in a whistling pot.
To cook foods, especially those on the diet, vegetables must first be washed thoroughly and then filtered thoroughly.
A deep pot is filled with one-third water and a steam filter is placed inside the pot.
The mouth of the pot is left half closed.
This allows the steam to escape easily from the pot.
The fire is first brought to the highest level to boil the water, then brought to a lower level to obtain a constant heat.
Vegetables and foods steamed for about 10 to 15 minutes are checked with a fork after they are thoroughly cooked.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the stove and placed on plates to be served.
The steaming technique preserves the appearance, color, and smell of food, so it is healthy.
Your food will taste the same.
This will preserve the quality and taste of the food.
At the same time, steaming, one of the most economical cooking methods, minimizes nutrient loss.
Steamed vegetables are more alive and vibrant, and they provide a satisfying treat to the eater.
This method is often preferred, especially in dietary foods, because it is lightweight.
David Bowie - Blackstar: the "last" album by the alien
Knowing you're gonna die, making that last album without telling anyone, turning your deathbed into a space of artistic expression in your music video...
This kind of work can seem a little too "top" for us earthly mortals.
I say earthly mortals because I am one of those who sincerely believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came to our Earth from another part of the universe, and now he's back home, that's all.
He came because he had an inspiration that needed to be given to all the artists in the world, not just Kiss or Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga.
He has done his duty with dignity.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price is $9.99 5/5
He probably fed on Warhol, Kubrick, who was from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he decided to say, "Is that something, I'm an alien?" and he interrupted us by saying, "Space Oddity".
He didn't really get involved; he was always a few steps ahead.
Many people have found their lost ways because of him.
He's a musician and a listener.
And if we leave aside his interest in the visual arts, his acting, it's unfair to say that his music was just music.
The characters, the song-by-song flow, the messages, the innovation, the taboo-defying, the discography, that he creates, that is an artistic whole for me.
I can't remember him as the progenitor of glam rock or the cousin of punk...
What about that avant-garde electronic movement, the jazz that he's had a love for since he was a kid?
David Bowie kept reminding us what the word "icon" meant until we chewed the word out.
It wasn't male, it wasn't female, it wasn't "human".
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a while on a mission.
That body left this world two days after the release of his 26th studio album, "Blackstar".
"Blackstar" and "Lazarus" that we listened to before the album came out, he tried to get us used to him going.
We thought, "He's old, he talks about death or something", he was aware of everything.
One more game...
The album's message and emotional charge are backed up by the wonderful "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", which were released long before, but re-edited and recorded for this album, along with "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", "'Tis A Pity She Was A Whore", which we can say were the number four songs we knew when the album was released.
I'd like to say the rest of them, "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are really good songs.
It's built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's just as sincere, as instantly emotional as "Blackstar".
Not death or a "reckoning with the past" album...
It's just a real "last" record.
The writing of "The End" of a musical life that is a masterpiece from start to finish.
Turkey was targeted in the Sultanahmet attack.
Holger Münch, head of the Federal Security Department, made statements on Tuesday on the attack on Sultanahmet Square in which 10 German citizens were killed.
Münch said the target of the attack was not German citizens, but Turkey.
"400 people under my watch".
But Münch said the Sultanahmet attack did not change the terror threat in Germany, adding: "We are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously".
Münch noted that the number of people who went to Syria from Germany to join ISIS has decreased, while many people have returned from war zones.
"There are almost 400 dangerous people we should not be keeping under surveillance right now", Münch said, noting that this was a major challenge for security units.
Munich called for better coordination and closer communication between police agencies in Europe.
Turkish authorities said the bomber was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the attacker's identity had not yet been determined.
Sezen Aksu is saying goodbye to the stage
Sezen Aksu, who celebrated his 40th anniversary with a concert series, charmed his fans with his concert "Sezen'li Yıllar" at the Volkswagen Arena yesterday evening.
The final concert of the series, the first part of which was held in July, took place on January 15-16 at the Volkswagen Arena.
Aksu took the audience on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
Besides love songs that touch on our personal lives, Aksu sang about social issues that are of deep concern to our country and our world.
Aksu, who said he would be leaving the stage after his promises, saddened his fans.
At the "Sezenli Yıllar" concert, Sezen Aksu came out with a different story in each piece to the fans who filled the Volkswagen Arena.
Each story, show, light show and stage show took the audience to a completely different time.
In the final part of the memorable concert, a video showing of Istanbul paintings of Revolution Erbil was also made.
Aksu also hosted her fans for the first time, featuring pre-recorded videos on stage.
In Ankara and Istanbul, the price of bread has increased by 25 cents.
In Ankara, 250 grams of bread has been sold for 25 cents, starting from yesterday.
On the eve of the New Year, especially in December, the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Livestock Faruk Çelik and the Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci had made statements in the form of "No increase in bread".
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of bread were sold yesterday for 1 TL.
"The increase in the price of bread was not made, the tariff decision was implemented two years ago", said Halil İbrahim Balcı, President of the Turkish Bakers Federation.
"This was a tariff decision made two years ago".
The Chamber of Commerce set that two years ago.
It's a price that applies throughout Turkey.
So, a new raise was applied for, and no price increase was made.
But because of the competition, in some areas of Ankara, the craftsmen were selling for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already selling for $1.
The craftsmen who rely on their counters, their bread, they don't lower the price.
No raise or raise.
They're enforcing the unenforced price.
"In the first half of 2016, the price of a kilogram of bread will definitely not exceed 5 TL and if we do not have a very big problem, we will finish the year at this price".
In some parts of Istanbul, bread is now selling for 1.25 TL.
Terrorism has covered Burkina Faso with blood this time
In the West African country of Burkina Faso, 23 people from 18 different countries were killed in an attack on a luxury hotel known to be a favorite of foreigners and UN officials.
The attack was claimed by al-Qaeda's North African branch.
The attack in Burkina Faso comes four days after the Islamic State carried out a terrorist attack in the capital of Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country with a population of 250 million.
A Canadian and an Indonesian were killed in a daytime bombing and gun attack on the Starbucks branch and police station on a busy street with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops.
Indonesian officials have said the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre on November 13.
The BBC's security correspondent Frank Garner pointed out that this action is part of a frightening trend that has recently been manifested in many cities around the world.
The United States has also recently been hit by acts of terrorism.
In early December, 14 people were killed in a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, USA, by a couple of ISIS sympathizers.
The San Bernardino attack that shook the United States
After the live bombing in Sultanahmet that killed 10 German tourists, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere recalled that there were terrorist attacks in many parts of the world.
If we say that, then terror will have won...
We used the phrase "without a backward step".
ISIS has left WhatsApp and is talking to Alrawi.
A new report says the terrorist organization ISIS is using its own chat tool to communicate independently of chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to a report from Defense One, the organization is using a new messaging app to communicate with each other.
This Android app called "Alrawi" is distributed and downloaded through an APK file.
The app allows organizations to message and share media among themselves in encrypted form.
Flash attack from ISIS in Iraq
The app's functionality remains "primitive" compared to popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
It's not known how strong the encryption used is.
ISIS previously used Telegram to send all of its communications through an encrypted connection.
However, Telegram had revealed the channels that ISIS members spoke on.
Moreover, the US government requires app developers to install backdoors into their apps.
So instead of relying on WhatsApp and Telegram to encrypt, the organization is now using its own solutions.
UAE: Iran is a nuclear satellite to the deal
Speaking at a press conference in Vienna, Kerry said Iran had fulfilled its obligations under the nuclear deal and that the United States had officially lifted economic sanctions against Iran.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted that he congratulated the lifting of sanctions following the nuclear agreement signed between six countries and Tehran.
The champion of the veterans is Fenerbahçe!
The 4 Seniors Hall Tournament, where the legendary players of Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray and Trabzonspor fought each other in the league format, ended with the final match played yesterday evening.
Fenerbahçe won the match 8-6 in the closed sports hall in Sakarya.
Fenerbahçe, which started the match quickly, closed the first half with a 5-1 lead, especially with the effective play of Marco Aurelio.
Galatasaray, who put tremendous pressure in the first minutes of the second period, scored consecutive goals to make the score 5-5.
However, Fenerbahçe managed to overcome the shock and scored two more goals to win the match 8-6.
While Elvir Baliç, Mehmet Aurelio, Ceyhun Erish and others were in the limelight in Fenerbahçe, Ayhan Akman, Umit Karan, Papen Mustafa, Hasan Shash and others were in the limelight in Galatasaray.
How should the semester be spent?
We asked Murat Aydın, an education specialist and student coach, how students should evaluate the semester vacation.
Semester holidays should not be thought of as just for students to relax, have fun, and spend time in front of the TV and computer.
The half-yearly leave is a very important opportunity to prepare for the new academic year and to review the past.
The so-called half-year holiday is also an important opportunity for personal development, knowledge, skills and hobbies.
Make a half-yearly evaluation list.
Write down everything you're going to do, everything you're planning, and try to do it.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and have a very productive semester.
Now let's talk about how to make a productive semester for our fellow students who are primarily preparing for YGS-LYS.
Because the most common questions we get from our friends who are preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are: "How should we use this period, should we solve a lot of questions or do we have missing issues?"
To answer these questions and to have a productive semester, let's start with some tips for students who are preparing for exams.
While the process of exam preparation should normally be a process that starts in the ninth grade, we try to complete it more in the last year, which forces us to spend the last year more effectively, efficiently and appropriately.
The senior must also complete his schoolwork along with exam preparation.
Although the graduate student has taken the exam (YGS-LYS) at least once and has had experience, the year in which he will prepare for the exam again as a graduate student is also critical for him.
Because most graduates and their parents see the year 10 as their last chance, and that creates even more stress.
Studying is something that the student does not enjoy, but only because he feels compelled to, and therefore usually always leaves at the end, but for the students who make it a regular, habitual practice, it becomes a task entirely and it is always within a plan of what to do when.
Now we have a half-year break ahead of us and we have to make the most of it.
To do so, we must have a plan that will help us to manage our time well.
Studying during the semester:
Each person should first make a plan that is appropriate to his or her situation.
Phase 1 should plan what has been done, what is missing; the day, the week and the 15-day time.
During this period, there should be both repetition and question-solving.
At the same time, students who are not too lacking can also solve an average of one or two test cases.
Fix Your Missing Topics: Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn within a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent within an hour.
And the best and most effective way to eradicate forgetting is to repeat.
Students who make a lot of mistakes in past subjects should especially emphasize general reviews.
Identify your missing items first and plan for the day, set a topic for each day, and make sure you address them.
This planning will give you both academic and psychological comfort.
And when you're putting things in your plan, be sure to notice that they're the ones you make the most mistakes about.
Because you won't be having a vacation this long in the future.
Make the solution of the question:
It's just as important to solve the question as it is to repeat the topic.
Because we can only know how much we understand about our work by the feedback we get from the questions we ask.
Remember to set a specific number of questions each day.
The number of questions you have to solve can vary depending on what you're doing that day, and you may not be able to solve many questions on a day when you're doing a lot of subject-based study, but we still need to do some sort of question-solving exercise to see how much we've learned about the subject that day.
Solve the test:
Another thing you should do during your semester is solve the exam.
Even though you're not done with the subjects, at least you can do the homework test solutions.
Let's say you've done a lot of Turkish, you can do 40 questions in Turkish.
And make sure you do time-training while you're doing it.
If you can solve 40 English questions in 60 minutes at first, then your next goal should be to solve them in a few minutes if possible.
Planning your vacation and hobbies:
Vacation, of course, does not mean just studying; you should also set aside a few days for rest, recreation, and hobbies.
A vacation spent studying alone will prevent you from being discharged and resting.
So you should plan for special times to be alone.
Reading books, watching TV, surfing the Internet may be part of your schedule, but the most important thing is how much time you spend on them.
I'll give a little advice to any friend who says I didn't have a productive first term.
If you think my first semester didn't go so well, I didn't work hard and I'm short of things, this semester is a great opportunity for you.
But first you have to decide and believe.
In the Turkish football super league, the goals were scored most often between the 76th and 90th minutes in the 2009-2010 season.
Now, answer your own question. Is the game over and you're going to the locker room, or is the game still on and you have a lot of minutes to score?
I guess no one wants to hear the classic comment of a losing football coach or player, "Now we'll look at the next game".
All you have to do now is let go of the past and look ahead, not walk, but run.
So, to sum up what we said:
1) Plan a semester vacation as a priority,
2) Repeat the same thing over and over again.
3) Fix the things you're missing.
4) Confirm the topic by solving the question,
5) Solve the test questions,
6) Read a book,
7) Set new goals for the new period,
8) Make time for yourself, your hobbies and things you enjoy,
9) Spend time with family and friends,
10) Spend time in social and cultural activities (movie, sports, theater, concerts, travel, picnics, etc.)
The caravan has travelled a long way.
Shinasi Demirel, founder of Kervan, one of the largest home chain stores in Turkey with 45 stores of an average of 1,000 square meters each, and his son Hasan, have added Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad and 25 stores in the country.
With the recently completed commercial registration operations, Kervan also owns 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Shinasi Demirel said that there are no Karavan stores abroad, "Now we will continue with Karavan, and Home Sweet Home".
He said, "The caravan will be sent abroad".
With the merger of Home Sweet Home, which had a turnover of 50 million liras in 2015, and Kervan, which had a turnover of 90 million TL, a retail chain with a turnover of 140 million liras, also with production, emerged.
With 45 stores in 35 provinces, the total sales area of Kervan is 45 thousand square meters.
25 of the stores are owned by the parent company.
I have about 500 people working at the caravan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores in 25 countries and overseas with a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and 320 employees.
Kadir Kalaycioglu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Home Sweet Home, who is a manufacturer, exporter and retailer, said he was very pleased to join the company.
From the beginning, we'd have a brand with the support of the Shinasi gentlemen.
Mr. Shinasi is the TRT of this industry.
We learned a lot from him.
We even got our first taste of shopping when he gave us the White Center.
We were already working with Caravan as strategic partners, not as rivals.
"Now with this merger, there will be a very serious synergy", he said.
Kalaycioglu said that Home Sweet Home has 17 stores abroad, with the bulk of them in the Middle East.
Kalaycioglu: "We also opened our first corner in Shanghai".
We made a deal with a chain of 200 stores.
"After that, we will develop large retail abroad as Caravan, small retail with Home Sweet Home", he said.
Poroshenko is selling his factory in Russia.
In an interview with the news site Liga.net, Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky said the factory was put up for sale for $200 million.
Moskalevsky said, "Yes, we put the factory up for sale".
"As soon as it went on sale, all the real buyers suddenly disappeared", he said.
As for the price of the company's plant in Lipetsk, Russia, Moskalevsky said: "We have set it at about $200 million".
Roshen, which produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and candy a year, is one of the world's largest producers and is owned by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Yıldız Holding is abroad
Yıldız Holding has merged its global businesses in the biscuit and chocolate sectors under the name "Pladis".
With the merger of De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ulker, a new $5.2 billion food giant with 26,000 employees is born.
Speaking at the meeting on the merger of global companies within Yıldız Holding, Yıldız Holding Board of Directors Chairman Murat Ülker said, "Becoming a global company was our goal from the beginning and added:
Murat Ülker broadcasted the 335 million liras sale live on Periscope
Founded 72 years ago, this company is now a global brand, a global company in the business of biscuit and chocolate confectionery under the name Yıldız Holding.
In that time, we've grown from biscuits to chocolate to candy to retail to packaging to real estate, personal care and a variety of industries.
We have 77 factories in 14 countries, 300 brands and thousands of points of sale.
Ülker said that the All Star Holding is "a family of more than 50 thousand people", and said, "Now that we look at the possibilities in our family, we want to go back to biscuits and chocolate sugar, which is to focus on our main business and be global in this field; for this we are reorganizing", and explained the new structure:
The life story of Ülker's father, Sabri Bey
We're reassessing our corporate structure, reorganizing.
We've divided the world into zones.
And we've assigned these areas to our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tuvcu is responsible for the Middle East, South Africa and the Turkish Republics.
Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for our global Godiva business as well as the Americas and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be in charge of the UK, continental Europe and Africa.
Ali Ülker, who I can call a guru of quality and innovation, will take on global responsibility in his field, while Cem Karakaş will help me manage the business.
China, Russia, partly Southeast Asia, will be the regions we will establish and develop.
Murat Ülker sold his shares in SAF GYO
"We promise happiness to the whole world with every bite", Murat Ülker continued, "Our global company we founded to achieve this is called Pladis".
"If you ask where you invented Pladis, it doesn't really have a special meaning", he said, adding:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
The Japanese are Subaru, the Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, we were inspired by the name of the Pleiades constellation, which is a seven-pointed star in Latin, meaning Country.
So we translated Ulker into the global.
Ali Ülker, Vice President of Yıldız Holding Board of Directors, also stressed that by cooperating with laboratories in different countries, "we have started to create synergy in innovation" and added:
We have very valuable R&amp;D teams, and we've gotten some synergies so far in working on a R&amp;D platform by bringing these teams together.
We have 27 R&amp;D centers under Pladis.
The largest of these are in Turkey and the UK.
We have over 300 R&amp;D specialists working here.
And the synergy work is already starting to pay off.
The Digestives' drage (Nibbles), which is produced in Ülker and will start exporting to the UK, is produced in Silivri at Ülker's chocolate factory.
Another example of synergy: the brands are different but the products are the same.
We quickly adapted a cracker technology developed in England, Jacob's Crinklys, to Turkey, bringing a nice flavor to our country under the name of Ülker Krispi Tırtıklı.
The Laviva we all know so well met with consumers in America today.
The Call of Duty franchise has surpassed 250 million
The series, which Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games have carved into the gaming world in gold letters, looks set to be remembered for years to come.
Especially the newly announced sales figures are proof enough of how legendary we should find them.
Activision, which holds the licensing rights to the series, showed 250 million copies in sales by the end of the year in a special share.
The company, which shared the sales figures for the entire series earlier last year, has since sold 75 million Call of Duty games.
And a large part of that is certainly Black Ops 3.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was elected as the President of the Republic once again
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected as the general president in the ordinary parliament.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who received 990 votes out of 238 delegates, became the president again.
248 of the votes cast were invalid.
After the result was announced, the partygoers celebrated.
CHP had a total of 1,275 delegates.
The congress has completed its work to meet at 10:00 on Sunday.
Kılıçdaroğlu summed it up:
We'd like to play games here, sing songs.
But the point we're coming at isn't encouraging.
There is an unmanaged reality in Turkey.
The atmosphere that's formed overshadows all of this.
The reason for the gloomy picture is the people who run the country.
As CHP, we are against terrorism, no matter where it comes from, no matter how it comes.
Terrorism is a crime against humanity and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terrorism is fought with intelligence, knowledge, and wisdom.
Of course we fight, we don't want anyone to bleed their nose.
How are the photos in Syria different from the photos in Lebanon, the photos in the Southeast?
While sitting at the table, they made some serious mistakes.
The blood that flows, the tears that die, all of it is power.
In 2002, they took over the country with zero terror, today we have a Turkey that is back to a lake of blood.
Who's responsible for all this?
The taxi driver in Diyarbakir is Shahmuz?
What is Turkey paying for?
We will attend meetings and share our thoughts about the change of the coup laws.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone's personal opinions.
I say, "Let's change the spirit of the coup".
The intellectuals of this country are being raided and detained in the early hours of the morning for expressing their views.
There are some things we disagree with, but people should be able to express themselves freely.
This dictator's son says, "He who eats the bread of the state and is an enemy of the state".
I want to ask him, why did those who eat the bread of the state and take advantage of all the facilities of the state not think when they robbed the state?
CHP is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country.
We will prepare together for the fourth great revolution.
We will bring libertarian democracy to this country at any cost.
They can arrest us, they can detain us, whatever they do, no matter how heavy the price, CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I make a clear call to you, Son of David.
Hiding behind the coup law, the man hiding hasn't lost his coup mentality.
You gave the man who gave you the honor a medal for distinguished service.
What kind of hit are you talking about?
It's all about deceiving the public.
The party officials listed the other 3 revolutions as follows: 1. the great revolution ending the monarchy and the establishment of the Republic; 2. the great revolution moving from the one-party period to the multi-party period during the Innu period; 3. the revolution with Bülent Ecevit and the transition to social democracy...
The president has qualities, duties.
Article 103 has the oath of office of the president.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
And if a man go out and make a vow, he shall perform it in his death.
Because honor and honor are not in dispute for us.
The man with the dictator's disguise, what honor and dignity mean to you.
What do you know of honor and honor, you who have made this oath?
What do you mean by honor and dignity?
I want to know that.
In a religious man, the concept of honor and honor is the crown.
Their intention is not to abolish the coup law, but to arbitrate the coup law.
Not enough, they want the presidential system.
What kind of presidency? A boss-led presidential system.
Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?
One person gives the orders, everyone does what they have to do.
Is the parliamentarian healthy in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring in libertarian democracy, the system works.
They call it a coup, but they've strengthened the law of coup.
Mustafa Balbay, a member of the parliament from Izmir, who announced his candidacy for the presidency, could not participate in the race because he could not collect the necessary 128 delegates' signatures.
Balbay, who collected 92 signatures, said, "I can't run under the current circumstances".
He noted that the former CHP Leader Deniz Baykal was sitting in the stands with the party members, while the MPs were sitting in the parliamentary hall.
Istanbul MP Gülay Yedekçi instead of sitting in the seat reserved for MPs, came early and sat next to the seat reserved for General President Kılıçdaroğlu.
The meeting between the MP from Yalova, Muharrem Ince, and Kılıçdaroğlu was also one of the topics discussed in the parliament.
Ince explained that he was offered PM membership and he refused.
However, from the general center sources, the claim came that the request for a meeting came from İnce and that the PM membership was not proposed.
Ince shared a message on Twitter, "Anyone can learn about this general center sources, the content of the meeting from Istanbul MP Ali Özcan".
And Ozcan said, "How can I know that two people are talking?"
He said, "He's been to see her".
The swordsman often applauded his father.
The party's parliament (PM) has marked the first day of the "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood Congress".
After the congress speech, Kılıçdaroğlu went home and started working for the PM list.
It was learned that while preparing the 100 key list of Kılıçdaroğlu, he told the current MYK members that he did not want to take part in the administration and that he would call 13 MYK members except Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karakaş and Seyhan Erdoğdu, who once again ran for PM.
It is stated that Kılıçdaroğlu may point to a narrowed list of 100 PM keys.
The 21-article final statement adopted unanimously at the CHP Congress demanded the removal of comments on the European Local Government Charter, which were raised by the DTK's autonomy debates, and increased power sharing at the local level.
The declaration also included goals of "ending the party state order", "establishing a sound and accountable rule of law".
The meeting was attended by the Deputy General Chairman Selçuk Özdağ from AK Party, Idris Baluken from HDP, Ruhsar Demirel from MHP.
The AK Party delegation left the hall after Kılıçdaroğlu's harsh criticism of President Erdogan.
"I saw that he missed the dose of criticism, I couldn't accept it", said Özdag.
The hall featured a banner with photos of the jailed journalists, Jan Dündar and Erdem Gül, and a banner with the words "How can darkness come to light if you don't burn, I don't burn?"
The congress started with the group commentary and Ahmet Kaya songs in the morning.
The message sent to the parliament by the wife of the head of the Diyarbakir Bar Association, who died in the armed attack, was applauded.
Berkin Elvan's mother Gülsüm and father Sami Elvan also attended the congress.
The part where Kılıçdaroğlu said that they would have the "death" of democracy at any cost was the part that got the most applause.
CHP, which has gathered 52 congresses so far, including 34 ordinary and 18 extraordinary, held its 53rd congress yesterday in Ankara Arena.
Turnout was high.
There were over 15,000 CHP in the 12,000-seat auditorium.
But the crowd was not enthusiastic.
The most exciting moment was when Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued as the couple greeted the hall.
There was no sign of discipline in the hall, as seen at AK Party congresses.
Even as Kılıçdaroğlu was speaking, there was a lot of activity in the arena.
Apparently, CHP members who wanted to enter the Party Congress preferred to seek support by telling party leaders and journalists about themselves.
One CHP executive tried to explain that this is not a bad thing, saying, "It is better than party members sitting like a rope, like party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union".
There is another difference between the CHP congress and the congresses of the AK Party or the MHP.
Only the general presidents speak at these parties.
In the CHP, the congress becomes a platform where party issues are discussed.
When the number of party members who wanted to speak at yesterday's congress was too high, the President of the Tribunal, Murat Karayalç, had difficulty in arranging the time.
There was a distance between the faces and the tongues of the people who said, "The country is going badly", and the comments, "You're going to change the course of things with the picture that comes out of this room".
All the CHP members said "Something must be done" but there was no consistent and strong answer to the question "What should be done".
The big impact was that there would be no election in the next four years.
When Kılıçdaroğlu came on the podium, we journalists were waiting for his answer to the question "What should we do?"
Kılıçdaroğlu first answered the question "What's going on?"
He pointed out the issue of the journalists in custody, what was done to academics due to the announcement, what happened in the Southeast, the impasse in foreign policy.
He responded to "Anatolian legends" about his party, such as "it is a non-religious party", "supports coups", "is the party of elitists".
And as for the "what to do" phase, he tried to come up with a "strategy" instead of talking about concrete steps.
He stressed that all these problems can be overcome with a stronger democracy and more justice.
He made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "We will work no matter what the cost until we bring democracy".
"We will fight to the death for democracy", he said.
A final note: the CHP has solved the "organization" issue by the 53rd congress, and now it can assemble without problems.
Meanwhile, a card was printed for 900 journalists who were told to follow the convention, but the press participation in the room was not at that level.
Representatives of media organizations in Ankara were not as eager to follow the congress as those at the AK Party congresses.
The self-government was asked for eternity
The indictment against the 7 accused in the Diyarbakir Republic Prosecutor's Office was accepted by the 4th Court of Heavy Penalties.
The indictment stated that on the instructions and calls of the top-level managers of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization, statements were made under the name of "autonomy" in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbakir, Istanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Muş, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Agrı.
The indictment, which stated that the leaders of the organization and youth and women organizations called for illegal actions, stated that there was an increase in bombing, long-barreled weapons and rocket attacks on security forces, public institutions and organizations, homes, workplaces and vehicles of citizens in Sur, Bağlar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro districts of Diyarbakir.
Our police station was hit by a shell.
The clashes between ISIS and the Fatah Army, which was formed by the opposition groups, in the village of Kara Mezra Bygddin, Syria, opposite Yavuzlu village of Kilis, have intensified in recent days.
The sound of gunfire and gunfire during the clashes between ISIS and the opposition near the border is also heard by Turkey.
While the smoke rising from the areas where frequent explosions occurred was visible to the naked eye by Turkey, security forces on the border line took intensive measures with armored vehicles.
On the other hand, from the village of Bygyddin under the control of ISIL militants, harassment fire was opened at the Shahid Mehmet Border Police Station near the village of Yavuzlu in Kilis.
As per the rules of engagement, the soldiers responded with shells and heavy weapons to the area where the harassment fire was opened.
It is alleged that Russian warplanes attacked the village of Hameyin, 17 kilometers from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians injured in the airstrike were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
The lottery rich got their checks.
The Robinsons, who live in a small house in Munford, Tennessee, worth $150,000, chose a single payment of $328 million over a 29-year period rather than a total of $528.8 million.
The couple said, "Well, we don't have a guarantee of tomorrow".
John Robinson, a chain store owner, and his wife, Lisa, who works as a dermatologist's assistant, said that even though they are now millionaires, they will be back at work on Monday.
The couple aims to use the money they earn primarily to pay off their mortgage and help their loved ones.
The grand prize was said to be split in three.
iOS9: how to get the new iPhone operating system, Apple update released
You can go to the Settings app for the new operating system, tap "General" and select "Update Software".
When you're ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and install.
Some users experienced a problem after this installation and received an error message saying "Software update failed".
To overcome this problem, users are advised to wait for the system to slow down or try iTunes and upgrade from there.
The phone will guide you through the rest of the process.
This could include deleting apps to make room - but Apple has prevented this from happening by shrinking updates and recommending some apps to delete and using a special tool to reinstall them when the process is over.
It's worth making sure your phone is charged or near a charger to keep your battery running while you're updating.
If the battery is too low, Apple won't allow the update, because the phone may stop halfway through to stop the update.

FedEx's revenue mixed, financial outlook will decline in 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant cut its full-year profit forecast due to declining demand for cargo services and rising costs on ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
It fell about 2.5 percent in pre-opening trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 based on research by FactSet.
Despite the average 4.9% increase that will take effect on January 4 and the high surcharges on heavy or large packages that will start in November.
The company says that profits from cost cuts, higher revenue and growth in e-commerce are still expected to be higher than last year.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing strongly despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday job plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire the same number of additional workers as last year, 90,000 to 95,000.
For the three months ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% year over year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, falling behind the $2.44 forecast of 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx was hit by a decline in international priority shipping last year, which led to a stagnation in revenue at the Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted FedEx Local Services' results.
In the last quarter, ground services revenue increased 29%, but operating income was essentially stagnant due to large packages and high costs on internal insurance.
While the cargo business saw a decline in revenue due to high labor costs, the express unit saw a high return due to high base rates.
In pre-opening trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday with an 11 percent drop for the year and a 17 percent drop from their record high of June 11.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers this week spent two days sitting around a 27-foot Honduras monster table deciding that it was time to raise interest rates by the times they have for nearly a decade.
The two-story conference room in a wing of the central bank will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The central bank has two tasks from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and to keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a third unwritten mandate: fiscal balance.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in an unpredictably close decision to be announced on Thursday as to whether the U.S. economy is ready to begin cutting off the unique stimulus support from near-zero short-term interest rates that have been in place since late 2008.
While most data shows the economy is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may make Fed officials, who are currently cautious, wary of adding vulnerability by raising benchmark federal funds rates - even by less than a quarter of a percent.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they're going to be watching", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they're looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer", he said.
There's no consensus on what the Fed should do, and that in itself is causing volatility in financial markets.
Half of the economists Bloomberg recently interviewed were expecting a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to hold off with the main indicator showing only a 30% chance of a rally.
This could signal a downturn in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless policy makers mitigate the impact by promising that another increase may be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
"The increase was triggered by Fed policymakers' expectation that the rate will remain stable this week", said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed raised rates right now", he said.
If Fed executives had decided to do so, "they would have had a long year to calm down the financial markets so they wouldn't panic".
Other experts suggested that a rate hike could calm financial markets as the fog of when the Fed would act lifted.
Just a month ago, the Fed looked set to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be a small step toward slowly tightening monetary conditions, strengthening the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said he expects this year's rate increase in the spring and early summer despite the Liberals' complaints about the need for a more economical process.
Despite the slowdown in the pace of job creation in August, growth in the labor market has been steady this year.
The unemployment rate last month fell to its lowest level in seven years, 5.1 percent, and is nearing the Fed's full employment rate.
The pay increases showed signs of improvement.
And even though inflation continues to watch below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed policymakers say the temporary impact of sharply declining oil prices is a major reason.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy "can and needs to cope with higher rates despite the labor market shortages".
But financial markets around the world began to shake after China devalued its currency late last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen below its May record high of 16%, as investors fear a slowing Chinese economy could drag down global growth.
The market somehow bounced back when the Dow was now almost 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil makes it even more complicated to calculate when to raise interest rates.
Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research associate at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official, said, "They may have been a little constricted at this meeting with the uncertainty of what's been happening in the financial markets in the Chinese economy over the past few weeks and the lack of news about the economic weakening".
Now he estimates they'll have to wait at least another month to better manage those effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects will be on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on to put forward developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's top concerns, so it should not technically be a factor in its takeover processes.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The only clue from then-President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed might "de-inflate" monetary expansion triggered by global market shocks.
In a world of increasingly interconnected markets and economies, Fed officials can be expected to not only follow developments elsewhere but also consult other central bank governors and experts to better read the global economy.
Zachary Karabell, global chief strategy officer at asset management firm Envestnet Inc., said decision-making is "more a skill than a science".
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Vice President Jeffrey Lacker pointed out this month that "the Fed has overreacted in the past to financial market movements that do not appear to be linked to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee who lobbied for rate increases, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
Lacker said that "despite limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth", the financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75% over three meetings.
A year later, Fed officials took back those cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee, said: "The Fed should only put monetary balance concerns on the front line during major crises, as it did during the 2008 market meltdown".
He said the last swell wasn't even close.
You really don't want to be afraid of going up a rate because the markets are upset, said Peterson Posen, president of the International Economic Institute.
The central bank law still has two powers and it doesn't mention financial equilibrium, and I don't think they should move in that direction until that changes.
You want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown
The market/depot opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Ltd.
LAX-C, often referred to as Thai Costco, is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, that's Chinatown, not Taiwan.
The market/depot is a one-stop shop selling a wide range of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asian and Thai snacks, kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive part if you want to buy motor oil.
The store is huge and it can take an hour to walk through all the hallways.
If you're hungry after all this shopping, grab some food from LAX-C BBQ Express.
The inside of the store is the food section (good, accounted for) next to the safes, and there are various out-of-store options.
What's in stock: you want something from Thailand?
It's probably at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes specialty Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits, and more.
The meat is on the shelf, and so is the fish - the people behind the counter clean the fish and make the fillets, and even fry them if you want.
A large part of the store has a large freezer section where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole duck, fish, calf blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial food and more.
Who's shopping: restaurant owners and cooks, families and individuals.
The wide corridors are lined with shopping carts and forklifts.
Fresh monthong durian found right by the exit stand.
Where: The store is in the industrial district of Los Angeles, between Chinatown and Downtown, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Park: LAX-C has its own parking lot, shared with other stores and restaurants.
Even though the store is very busy, it is not usually difficult to find a parking space.
The Rio Grande Pediatric Society of Brazil promotes healthy eating during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS used a shocking method to try and teach women the importance of healthy eating during breastfeeding by including images of infants with unhealthy food.
Human milk is made up of many proteins, fats, vitamins, and a variety of carbohydrates that provide all the nutrients needed for babies to develop a healthy immune system.
Because of the excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories.
However, recent research shows that the dietary supplementation that mothers need is not limited to calories.
A new study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women affected the genetic expression of their babies, protecting them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets have been shown to adversely affect a child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to dominate the ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's moves to Canberra to overthrow the Liberal leadership failed to deliver a rating boost for Today.
After Tony Abbott's fall to Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was staged in the national capital.
Hosted in London by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, Rival Sunrise was wedged between weekly international series including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
As if the distance issue didn't make much difference to Australian viewers, Sunrise averages 397,000 viewers in five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today posted a slight increase in ratings on Monday (317.000) compared to last Tuesday (283.000), but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343.000).
Today has been closing in on Sunrise for the past few months.
Today averaged 318,000, compared to Sunrise's 330,000 in August.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, the Sunrise average is 349,000 compared to Today's 314,000.
This is the most exciting thing that's happened in all the mornings.
The winds of change are affecting more people this morning than the parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The first half hour of the new information contest hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
In the second half (17:30-18:00), the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
The first half hour of Monday Night Live Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, while the second half hour saw an increase to 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Following Australia's second night's rating decline, Nine thought the Hot Seat would take the lead at 5:30.
Next up was Australia, a replacement for the failed Million Dollar Minute on McGuire's show.

The last three think that Single Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he pick?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who won The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood was going to pick at the end of his bachelor show was kept a secret.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell me who took the last rose.
But if we check with Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski the day before the three fell to two, they may have given a hint without knowing who the winner would be.
Sam Wood has sealed his mouth until Thursday's final.
All three women spoke lyrically about why Wood was perfect, highlighting his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude, and why they wanted to be his partner.
But their answers to the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?" may contain a hint of who will win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been pretty close since day one.
"From the moment I got home", Jeavons-Fellows said, "I read [Sarah's] energy and Sam's energy and felt they fit together, and I thought that way throughout the program".
Markoski added: "Sarah is very practical, and she's a lot of fun to be around".
I saw them together, and there's chemistry.
They feel so good and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would make a very good couple.
Mackay said that last week's house calls made him think Wood was "the right guy".
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was definitely not just a game - I was now completely dependent on him", she said.
When asked who Wood would choose without him, it was a mystery.
He said, "I don't know if I can say that".
"I love the other girls equally - Snezana and Lana equally".
The Bachelor airs on Ten on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m.
First release: is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had a number of options as to where he would begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown great interest in him since he moved to the States, and after his impressive open practice day last year, many other teams have approached him.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems like a very wise decision.
Some coaches have placed Hayne on the bench for his loss in the Australian rugby league, as in the 20-3 win over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed this guy and gave Hayne another shot at a game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued to show her true colors in the locker room after the game.
Instead of humiliating the rookies in front of the whole team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne at the post-match press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also took encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey and was advised to forget about the fall and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne, leading the Minnesota Vikings to a score in the first quarter, drops the ball
This was not what Hayne and his broad Australian fan base dreamed for his first game in the NFL.
Hayne was seen swearing off the field after dropping the ball, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not think of a worse start to his NFL career.
Hayne said, "It was just one of those things, you get upset about the next game and that's it".
Hayne also recalled his 2007 Origin debut with a rebound pass that scored for Queensland.
Still, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a post on Instagram after the game, holding an Australian flag with fans.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at a crossroads in Siberia with a gun.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was jailed, the oil company Yukos was seized, and pro-democracy efforts were cut short.
Four people killed in Nepal police plastic bullets fired at protesters
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed when police fired plastic bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The incident occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
District chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 people gathered outside a police station, some throwing rocks and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police fired pepper spray into the air before using plastic bullets.
He said 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It's not clear why plastic bullets, which are known to kill but are generally a less lethal alternative, result in such a high fatality rate.
The clashes were the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group have suggested that the areas created by the proposed new constitution will dilute their political influence.
Ethnic Tharus groups who want to establish their own state are also protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes since August 10, including 11 police officers.
At that time, the four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions - an important but unrest-ridden step toward a new constitution in Nepal, which has been ruled by a central government for centuries.
Work on a new constitution had been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands.
Lawmakers worked on the draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new text would be ready by Sunday.
NHC says there's a 60 percent chance of a hurricane in the southern Cape Verde Islands.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday that a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 kilometers) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical storm within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecast center said there was a 60 percent chance of a tropical storm forming in the next two days.
Google has launched a matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a matching fundraising campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries to Europe.
Google announced the donation initiative on its blog with an unexpectedly personal approach.
Instead of an executive making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her own personal experience.
"Our journey was one of hunger, thirst, cold and fear, as well as many dark bus and train journeys", he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe grows, many families, like mine, need help.
The donations will go to four nonprofit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the first $5.5 million donation at google.com/refugeerelief until it raised $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely due to the four-year Syrian civil war that has displaced more than four million people this year.
They also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For moderately obese diabetics , weight loss surgery may help .
A new study suggests that it may take at least five years for obesity surgery to show benefit in moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
But it's too early to tell if moderately obese diabetics live longer after surgery for obesity than patients who haven't had surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery who wrote a paper on JAMA surgery, "it takes a long time for mortality rates to show up".
Weight loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the diameter of the stomach.
These reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with advanced obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9, measured as the ratio of height to weight, is considered normal.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, while a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI at this link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital used data from an experiment that compared two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastric bypass - used to treat moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes since 2007.
By the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those who had surgery had dropped from 31 to 24.5.
In contrast, those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment had a BMI of stable around 29.
Diabetes is completely resolved in 36% of surgical patients and partially resolved in 28% of surgical patients.
In contrast, only 1% of the patients in the medically treated group had complete and only 2% partial resolution of diabetes.
The authors also noted that blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "surgery group".
The researchers also imaged blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels of the patients over time.
The researchers wrote that it's best to keep A1c hemoglobin below 7%.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c dropped from an average of 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the treatment group, it was stable at about 8 percent.
But this improved "glycemic control" with the improved A1c hemoglobin levels did not reduce mortality over the five years, according to the study's lead author, Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team compared the findings with the two types of surgery.
By the fifth year, the bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 kg to 14.2 kg) than the gastric tube surgery group, had higher decreases in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and similarly in A1c hemoglobin (3.1 to 2.1) and were more likely to have their diabetes completely resolved (46.9 to 16.7%).
Although the study did not show a clear benefit in survival after surgery at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of the Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix said that a study in Sweden of overweight patients had valid data that surgery extended life expectancy.
In this Swedish study, obese patients who had bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years than a group who had more traditional treatments.
Although this new study did not show what the survival benefits of surgery patients are, Blackstone said it is reassuring for those who are relevant and have a BMI below 35.
And this is the most vital part of the article, because it says that in the low BMI group, this surgery is safe, there's no increase in the risk of death or kidney disease, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking weight gain seriously once a patient's BMI falls below 27 to 30.
I think we've waited long enough for people to take this seriously.
I think it's really hard to reverse once you've accumulated these genetic changes in your body that are linked to obesity and diabetes.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama said Europe could not accommodate all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis at the opening of the Dalai Compassion Centre in Oxford, which will study ethical issues, at the start of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He argued that under the present circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of nations or continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, although appreciated, was inadequate in this context.
In his speech, he said, "It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe".
While he appreciated the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, the Dalai Lama said they were only a temporary solution.
"It's great to take care of a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions, how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries, primarily through education", he stressed.
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never been the solution to problems".
In his address on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also referred to George Bush's actions after the September 11 attacks, saying that the US' violent response had started a chain of events that could not be controlled.
In my letter to President Bush after 9/11, I expressed my wishes for mental health and said that the only way to solve this problem was through nonviolent means.
I know his motives were well-intentioned, but he used force and it led to unintended consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
The number of children swallowing hand sanitizer has quadrupled in the last four years .
The U.S. Centers for Poison Control reports a nearly 400 percent increase in swallowing wet wipes with high levels of alcohol in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, reported cases of hand antiseptic swallowing in children under 12 years of age rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are becoming more interested in these kinds of products, and unfortunately, there are those in the percentage that will be taken to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said some kids drink hand sanitizer on purpose, while others do it to impress friends or in a social media claim.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking antiseptic for a cheap drink.
Some teenagers have been reported to mix antiseptic mixtures with alcohol-containing mouthwashes to get a harder drink.
Young children can be attracted to the attractive antiseptic scent.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think that's a bad thing".
The most attractive ones are the ones with the smell.
There are hand sanitizers with strawberry, grape and orange flavorings that are extremely appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer is 45 to 95 percent alcohol by the looks of it.
Especially in young children, just a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City that it was "high concentrations of alcohol".
You don't leave a few scotch glasses lying around, but people leave these hand sanitizers lying around, and that's an easy way for kids to get a fair amount of alcohol.
Recently, six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who swallowed only four strawberry-scented hand sanitizers at his school, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated him at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, which was twice the legal limit for an adult.
Nhaijah couldn't pronounce words and when he got to the emergency room, he couldn't walk.
Rithey reports that alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, so doctors kept her in a separate children's hospital for overnight observation despite any signs of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN it was "very scary".
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or to keep antiseptic wipes out of reach of children, keeping their skin contact short.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a hand sanitizer containing an unnamed poisonous substance.
Health authorities suggested that the substance in question might be methyl alcohol, not ethyl alcohol, as listed on the ingredients list.
In January, three fourth graders from upstate New York conspired to "plant antibacterial products around the classroom" in order to poison their "wicked" teachers, according to police reports.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and has banned its use in class.
The police described the plan as a "futile attempt" and recommended disciplinary action to the school administration.

The killer is out there, waving his arm and looking at us and smiling.
Some are trying to distract attention.
When the killer is in sight, instead of pointing at him, he creates opportunities for him to escape.
It's a trap for the killer.
He's hiding it.
And after he disappears, he tells the person he's meeting that he didn't really do anything wrong.
The battle we've been fighting for the last 10 years is very clear.
Someone wants to narrow the ring of fire around us and burn us too.
And someone is trying to stop it, to put out the fire around us.
Someone's in trouble for robbing and robbing.
Someone's after making, manufacturing.
There are those who see us, our region, in all forms of war.
The civil war.
The war between the states.
The war of the factions.
The proxy war.
And they have suburbs.
They're dirty terrorist groups.
Bloody clowns with hands.
Different names, different formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight each of these.
He fights, and therefore he must face the evil of all.
Keep fighting until you're sure of your harm...
The traitors had no skirts and took refuge in white cloths.
The PKK members, who are cornered in the neighborhood, find the solution to mix and flee among the white flags and the citizen.
Security forces are using GBT to prevent infiltration.
The activist power of the organization, which has suffered a major blow in the countryside and beyond the border with peace and democracy operations that began on July 23, is also being broken.
According to sources in the area, the weapons and ammunition depot of the group that suffered a major blow in Silopi was seized and rendered ineffective.
Some civilians fleeing attacks by the PKK are fleeing the conflict points under the control of the police and soldiers with white flags in their hands.

The commands will prompt the deletion
In the area, the military and police have dealt a major blow to the terrorist organization in Cizre.
The Yafes neighborhood, where the militants are nesting, has been largely cleared.
Joint teams of police and gendarmerie special operations units completed their tasks and gave their place to commandos.
The commandos stationed in the Jaffa neighborhood are also taking precautions to prevent the terrorists from re-entering.
In other districts, security will be left to the commandos in the neighborhoods where the joint teams have cleared the terrorists.
A ton of baklava for the police and the soldiers
The municipality of Kilis sent 1 ton of baklava to special operations police and soldiers serving in difficult conditions in Cizre, Sur and Silopi.

15 million liras for 7 thousand 750 euros
Viola Colombo, a woman from Venice, Italy, won the right to convert 15 million lire into euros from an old chest she bought on the Internet auction site eBay.
Colombo's bid to exchange the former Italian currency lira for the euro, which had been worth several euros in 2014, was rejected by the Central Bank.
Colombo, who was found to be right, will receive 7 thousand 750 euros (about 26 thousand TL).
Application to UNESCO for island where no woman can enter
Japan applied to make Okinawa Island a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2017, where only men are allowed to set foot because of its temples.

Saudi Arabia has not given up on TÜBİTAK
Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Fikri Işık said that a new agreement has been made for the sale of the second batch of the Balistic Image Analysis and Recognition System (BALISTICA) developed by the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Organization (TÜBİTAK) to Saudi Arabia.
Işık made statements about the ballistics developed by the TÜBİTAK Space Technologies Research Institute.
The system allows for the comparison of ballistic examinations of weapons, ammunition cores and shells seized in the incidents with the data in the central database, Işık said, thus eliminating the problems that ballistics experts encounter when examining shells.
Işık said that data obtained from different geographical locations and accompanying information can be questioned by being hidden together thanks to ballistics.
Noting that one of the most important features of BALISTICA is the ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data that provides more detail and fewer errors, Işık stressed that thanks to the innovations brought by the system, decisions that the ballistics specialist will make can be made quickly and the success rate is greatly increased.
BALISTICA was exported under the "SUBA-1 Project"
Işık stressed that BALISTICA met all the criteria in the success criteria and received a full note from the General Directorate of Security, and said that the system, which was set up in 10 different regions, including Ankara, covers the whole of Turkey.
He said that the system was successfully launched abroad and that the "SUBA-1 Project" with Saudi Arabia had been exported and installed successfully in 6 regions in 2013.
Işık said that a new agreement was made for the sale of the second batch of BALISTICA to Saudi Arabia, and the SUBA-2 was signed, which is the continuation of SUBA-1, adding that the number of BALISTICA that will serve in Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement, which includes the development and installation of 8 additional systems.
A crocodile fossil the size of a bus was found.
A prehistoric sea crocodile was reported to have been 10 meters long and weighed 3 tons.
The crocodile's skull alone was measured at five feet [1.6 m] long.
The researchers have named the species "Machimosaurus rex" and published their findings in the journal Cretaceous Research.
Federico Fanti, senior author of the article, of the University of Bologna, said that the fossil, thought to be 130 million years old, was "almost the size of a bus".
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said that the giant saltwater crocodile "was at the top of the food chain at that time, at least in some areas".
Paleontologists explain that M. rex, thought to be the largest crocodile in the sea, hunted by ambushing in lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is believed to have lived 110 million years ago in Africa and South America, reaching up to 40 feet [12 m] in length and weighing up to eight tons.
They're all so confused!
Ece Temelkuran's first book, 'All Women's Heads Are Confused', was adapted into a play by Aysa Production Theatre.
The play, which stars Deniz Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, Kaynak from İpek Türk, Kadir Çermik and Shebnem Sönmez, is directed by Selen Uçer.
Ucher's first experience as a scriptwriter and director, her plays 'Poz' and 'Dry Sıkı' are still ongoing.
The play met with an audience at the Trump Center last week.
The play begins with the radio play.
A voice in the dark, taking us back to the past...
Then the curtain goes up.
A woman standing by the window, about to jump.
Who he was and why he tried to kill himself, can be seen by the intervention of his next-door neighbors.
A letter is left
'Ebru Uysal' played by Deniz Chakır, a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
It's got stuff from when you were a kid.
The lack of fatherly love, the rejection of his student life, his lonely childhood, his bad relationships, his feeling of being misunderstood, that's what got him to this point.
He decided to kill himself by leaving a note behind, but he can't jump out of a window.
Because the chatty cleaner of the next apartment, Aysel (Zeynep Kankonde), is being talked into it by the mysterious woman Perran (Sebnem Sönmez), who sits across the room from her.
They're approaching it as a normal, routine process.
She's getting more tense and can't concentrate and jump.
The conversation between the three turns into a thriller when the famous singer who cleaned his house, Meltem Kaya, joins in.
'Meltem' approaches the situation in her own naive and intimate way, but when she sees the crowd below, she can't help singing.
This interesting suicide attempt takes on a different dimension when real estate agent 'Murat' (Kadir Çermik) enters the girl's house with a spare key.
The singer Meltem's false information to the press is making things worse.
The song "Street Girl" by Nazan Öncel is also used in the play.
The BUNALIM GREEN
Ucher, who directed the first time, managed to provide the tempo and fluidity of the play.
The comedy part of the play is being performed by Zeynep Kankonde and Silk Turk.
The two of them are cartoon characters who make the audience laugh with their facial expressions and their lines.
While Sönmez's experience is very well translated into the stage, Deniz Çakır also shows a convincing performance in reflecting the depressed mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Çermik, who made a name for himself with his performance in Tolga Çelik's award-winning film 'Sarmaşık', is successfully accompanying these four women.
Described as a tragic comedy, the one-act play promises to be a laugh without confusion.
Often, the words that come to mind from the mouth of 'Perran' played by Sönmez are:
All children have thought about dying once to punish their parents and for some reason they have cried all the time.
She's hanging in the air like some kind of misunderstood joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she forgot the most important part.
In fact, every story begins with some kind of abandonment.
I have to stick my hands in my pockets sometimes; I can't stand things without pockets.
You wonder where you're gonna put your hands.
The more surprising, the more hands we have.
People talk behind their backs, make up stories.
A misunderstanding is real.
All women are confused because they get confused.
You're lucky to live if you can't die.
'Eat the infidels and live long'
Can be safely consumed at any age
Speaking about the health benefits of kefir, which is the main ingredient of milk, but is more beneficial than milk, expert dietician Pinar Kural Enç said that kefir is one of the foods that can be consumed with confidence at any age.
It's also rich in vitamins B1, B12 and K.
It's a foundation for a healthy nervous system, thanks to its calcium and magnesium content.
It's also a good source of phosphorus.
Kefir, which also keeps you full, also doesn't lose weight.
"It's a very high-quality drink and very easy to digest", she said.
♪ The cure for all the troubles ♪
Speaking about the possibility of children, elderly, pregnant women and women who have reached menopause consuming kefir, expert dietician Pınar Kural Enç said, "Kefir is a local drink made mainly in the Caucasus".
But now he's starting to make his name known to the world.
Kefir, the secret of youth, the potion of long and healthy life, is a cure for almost every problem.
And one of the most natural ways to keep babies from metabolic disease is kefir.
It's a friend of the gut.
This unique drink, which is not limited to its benefits, is a friend of the intestines.
There are 1.5 to 2 kilograms of bacteria and fungi in your gut.
The microorganisms in your digestive system are also divided into two groups: beneficial and harmful.
Beneficial microorganisms are called probiotic microorganisms.
The activities of probiotics are as important as our liver, and when consumed in sufficient quantities, they prevent harmful microorganisms in the gut from sticking to the intestinal wall and spreading.
An imbalance of healthy microorganisms in the gut causes many diseases.
The health of the digestive tract must be maintained by proper nutrition.
And for that, we need to eat enough probiotics.
It eliminates these intestinal problems.
Kefir is the most potent probiotic bacteria food, and the beneficial bacteria it contains have a huge effect on the strengthening of the intestinal system.
It allows the beneficial bacteria and fungi in the gut to reproduce and be useful.
Regular use of kefir helps bowel function, eliminates intestinal disorders, reduces swelling, and improves digestion.
A healthy gut means a healthy body, free of disease.
"Kefir, which also helps with appetite, insomnia, upper respiratory infections and allergies, helps babies get more quality vitamins and minerals from food, so it plays an important role in baby nutrition", he said.

The technical director of Beşiktaş, Şenol Güneş, is expected to put his ideal 11 in the field against Mersin Sports Stadium.
The experienced technician, who faced 1461 Trabzon from the PTT 1st League teams twice in the Ziraat Turkey Cup and assigned different squads in these matches, will return to the ideal 11 in the Mersin İdmanyurd match.
In the last match against the representative of the Black Sea, Ismail Köybaşı, who was slightly injured, was expected to be in the first 11, while Güneş, in the middle field, planned to give the form to Olcay Shahan.
Probably 11
The possible 11 of Beşiktaş are as follows:
He is also a member of the board of directors of the National Association of Realtors.
Three players on the penalty line.
Three players are on the yellow card limit in Beşiktaş before the match against Mersin İdman Yurdu.
Mario Gomez, Luiz Rhodolfo and Andreas Beck, who have three yellow cards in the Super League, will not be able to wear the uniform in the game against Trabzonspor in the 19th week of the season if they see a yellow card against Mersin İdmanıurdu.
Gomez is the lamb of Beşiktaş.
In the match between Beşiktaş and Mersin İdman Yurt, the eyes will be on the German player Mario Gomez.
The 31-year-old, who also scored in the last four league matches in black and white, was at the top of the goal-scoring competition.

Crisis of technical director at Mersin Sports Center
Mersin Sports Stadium, which couldn't finish the first half of the Super League where it wanted, had a technical director crisis in the middle of the period.
The 48-year-old technician was separated from the other coach at the Mersin Sports Center, where he finished the first half under the guidance of Bülent Korkmaz.
Hakan Kutlu, who was appointed to lead the red-black team instead of Korkmaz, only stayed one day at the helm of the team he had previously coached.
In the middle of the round, an extraordinary general meeting was held at Mersin Sports Center, where Hüseyin Çalışkan was elected president of the club.
Mersin İdmanlı, after Nurullah Sağlam, he will be facing Beşiktaş without a technical director because he has not yet reached an agreement on a new name.
Emotional letters from tiny students
Letters from children in the West poured in to the police and soldiers who are conducting terrorist operations in the region, including Sur district, the center of Diyarbakir.
First up is Aksaray 75.
The students of the Istanbul West Ataşehir Natural Science High School and Eskişehir Ataçag Middle School, which is the Republic Primary School, began working in coordination.
As a result, students in schools printed choreographed moon-star shapes on chocolate, and then made nearly a thousand letters, poems, and drawings.
The children sent their work to the Diyarbakır Police Department.
The Diyarbakır Police Department has set up an exhibition table on the coordinated work of children in the west.
The exhibition was set up in the new building of the Police Department.
The exhibition was visited by police officers and citizens who were serving in the building of the Security Directorate.
The letters and pictures, with their meaningful writing and poems, touched the hearts of the readers.
A student wrote a letter about the operations in the Sur district of the center, saying, "Dear police, we are grateful for your sacrifice to protect innocent people in Diyarbakir".
It's been learned that the exhibition will last until the middle of next week.
She named her daughter 'Angela Merkel'
Another refugee baby has been named after German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been criticized for her refugee policies.
Memun El Hamza, 26, who managed to reach Duisburg, Germany, fleeing the war in Syria, and his wife, Tema El Havar, 21, named their first child "Angela Merkel".
"We are grateful to be here.
We named our daughter Angela Merkel to show that".
Father Memun El Hamza said: "Germany has become like a mother to us".
This is the second "mark"
It was learned that baby Angela Merkel was born on December 27.
According to German media reports, little Angela Merkel, who weighs 3 kilos and 300 grams and is 55 centimeters tall, is in good health.
Last year, a refugee from Ghana named his daughter Angela Merkel, and some refugees held up banners saying "Mother Merkel" in support of Merkel.
Consumer confidence in the US at seven-month high
According to university data, UMICH was up 0.7 points in January compared to the end of December to 93.3.
As a result, the market expectation for the index, which recorded its highest level since June 2015, was set at 92.9.
Michigan Consumer Research Director Richard Curtin said in a written statement, "Consumer confidence has increased for the fourth consecutive month as expectations for future economic growth improve".
"In general, individual funding expectations have also maintained their highest level since 2007 due to weakness in inflation", he said.
The statement also predicted that consumer optimism would now depend on inflation remaining extraordinarily low.
UMICH, which last year posted its best annual performance since 2004 with an average of 92.9, is determined based on the results of a 50-question survey of at least 500 people each month.

Putin is licking his spit.
While Russia is preparing to grant Turkish companies the status of "can do business with Russia" if they cannot afford the services Turkey provides in another way, the Russian Tour Operators Association has made a statement that "Russian citizens are not giving up on Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which estimates that the severance of existing economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia, has prepared and published a new draft "Exceptional Situations" regarding Turkey for the Russian government.
According to the draft published in the Russian Federal Regulatory Directory, Turkish companies and firms are allowed to do business with Russia even if they enter the sanctions zone if necessary.
According to the draft, Turkish companies and firms will be able to use their products and services in cases where it is impossible to provide them from other sources outside Turkey or if domestic production in Russia would bring significant additional costs.
The mixed commission to be established within the Russian Ministry of Economic Development together with other relevant ministries will determine which goods and services of Turkish origin will be included in this category.
So that it can be decided by the bureaucrats which Turkish companies can work with Russia.
Again, according to the same document, state agencies and private companies in Russia will have to prove to the commission that their work with Turkish partners is not equivalent.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government and comes into force, the registration of privileged Turkish companies in Russia will also be created.
The Russian Association of Tour Operators said in a statement yesterday that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey.
"Despite the ban on tour sales and the Russian Foreign Ministry's advice not to travel to Turkey, our citizens have begun to look for the formula to organize their holidays on their own", the statement said.
The number of posts on social networks with the title 'The most practical and cheapest way to vacation in Turkey' is skyrocketing.
The most common suggestion is to book a hotel online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the fall in oil prices below $30 as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
"It was a very bad surprise for our government, as no one thought that oil would fall to $30", Medvedev said.
It seems that the budget will not be able to be implemented as it is".
The last month of the year 2015 that we left behind.
In the wake of the downed plane crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that economic sanctions would be further tightened.
In those days, our businessmen, our personnel, who tried to go to Russia in the usual way, were literally struggling at the border gates.
Turkish goods are being dragged through customs, subjected to unimaginable controls.
Not long after, a month has passed and yesterday Nerdun Hacıoğlu reported from Moscow.
One way or another, the sanctions are easing.
But why?
The reason is simple.
In an era of such economic globalization, closing the border gates with the methods of a century ago is no longer enough to turn political strife into economic war.
Look, we still report on Iran and how the economic embargo that's been in place for years has been broken.
Two neighboring countries that seem to be very friendly, but are not really, like Russia and Turkey, actually need each other.
It's technically impossible to tear apart these two countries, merging businessman, tourist, entrepreneur, client, overnight.
If you close the gates, people from both countries will be able to enter each other's country.
The best thing to do is to have a political discussion at the table and settle the score before the sanctions create new Reza Zarrabs.
Without contaminating the economy...
Hotel attack in Burkina Faso: 20 killed
At least 20 people are reported to have died in a car bomb attack on the Splendid Hotel in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso.
Burkina Faso's Interior Ministry officials said security forces found 20 bodies, some in the hotel lobby and some in the hotel cafe.
The operation, which was carried out by the security forces supported by French special forces, reportedly rescued 63 hostages, including the Minister of Labour of Burkina Faso, 33 of whom were injured.
It's unknown how many hostages and assailants are in the 147-room hotel.
Eyewitnesses said that two bomb-laden vehicles exploded outside the Splendid Hotel, which is mostly used by United Nations personnel and foreigners, and that three or four masked people entered the hotel.
Sad news from the wall: 1 martyr
Ali Bulduk, a police officer who was seriously injured in the explosion of a homemade explosive device planted by terrorists in Sur district, where the curfew continues for the 46th day, was taken to the Diyarbakır Military Hospital and died despite all the interventions.
It was found that the martyr was registered in the population of Adana.
Diyarbakir did not support the terrorist act!
According to the information received, at 17.00 pm, a protest was planned in front of AZC Plaza on Ekinciler Avenue in the Office district of Yenisehir district of Diyarbakır.
No one took part in the call to action, which was called by the citizens with leaflets and calls.
Thousands of people participated in the previous demonstrations, but the recent demonstrations were not supported by the citizens.
The group, which could not secure sufficient majority in front of AZC Plaza, disbanded without being able to carry out their actions because they did not get support from the citizens of Diyarbakir.
Terrorists burned down a school in Diyarbakir
According to the information received, the incident occurred in the 1007th Street of Yunus Emre neighborhood, central Bağlar district.
A group of masked terrorists entered the Nuri Zekiye Has Middle School here around 7.30pm and fled after setting the building on fire with Molotov cocktails.
The building caught fire and the citizens who were around it called the fire department.
The fire department called the police and asked for security to allow them to enter the area.
A large number of police teams with armored vehicles were sent to the area.
Firefighters who arrived at the school after security was taken over extinguished the fire without enveloping the entire building.
Then, while police teams were conducting an investigation, a multi-pronged effort was launched to apprehend the fleeing terrorists.
On the other hand, some police officers who were at the scene helped the journalists to take pictures, while one police officer tried to prevent the journalists who wanted to take pictures.
ATM thieves gave up the collar
Police teams from the Izmir Police Department started working on a complaint that some people had their bank card information copied and money was taken from their accounts, and spent.
The police, who identified the perpetrators as M.M.G. (43) and R.O. (32), found that the suspects copied the card information of citizens with the help of "card copying system" and "mini camera" placed in ATMs in different provinces of Turkey.
The suspects learned the passwords and were identified as having used them to make transactions.
The operation led to the arrest of the suspects.
The teams that examined the laptops used by M.M.G. and R.O. found numerous video recordings of a mini camera system set up to intercept the passwords of citizens who transact at ATMs, and determined that the suspects stayed in the provinces they went to for a short time to avoid being caught.
It was also revealed that the suspects obtained 50 thousand liras unfairly by copying the process on 15 different ATMs in Izmir.
The suspects were arrested and taken to court.
Authorities warned citizens to check account movements regularly against such incidents and to screen their hands when entering passwords at ATMs.
Netherlands: Assad should be tried in The Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.
Speaking at a conference in The Hague, Koenders said Assad was responsible for the refugee flow.
Pointing out that peace in Syria is not possible as long as Assad is in power, Koenders noted:
Assad needs to be tried at the Hague.
Someone with that much blood on their hands should be held accountable.
Assad is also solely responsible for the refugee influx we are currently facing.
I am aware, however, that Assad will not be leaving office anytime soon.
This issue needs to be discussed first and Russia needs help in this regard.
Protests against Burak Yilmaz
In the 59th minute of the game against Medicana Sivasspor, Burak Yilmaz failed to reach the goal he wanted to give Sneijder.
Burak Yilmaz reacted to the whistle-blowers with a hand gesture.
Then the reaction escalated and whistles of protest were heard as each ball hit the goalkeeper's foot.
Then some of the stands supported Burak Yilmaz and protested the fans who reacted meaninglessly to their own players.
Then a large part of the stands supported Burak Yilmaz.
There's no inconsistency at Celtic.
Deila says the Hoops are in a bad place and she'll get over it, while Griffith ignores the word "incompatible" at Celtic.
The battle of hearts, the SFA's punishment of Neilson and Warburton's timidity in the face of the January signings that disunited the team.
The Don's have the lead on Celtic to five.
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a fair victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, giving the Dons the chance to create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about the word incompatibility.
Griffith pushes back on the rumours of inconsistency at Celtic, saying he and his teammates were not bothered by the increased sense of scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League Leaders.
I don't think we're feeling pressured, I'm sure the players are looking forward to it.
The fact that the Scots aren't in the title race is upsetting the Dutchman de Boer.
Ronald de Boer, former Rangers midfielder and former international star of Dutch football, says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as they have no competition with Rangers.
De Boer, who is already an Ajax ambassador, said: "They don't give Celtic match summaries in the Netherlands anymore, why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old team.
They're talking about teams, they're talking about each other, they're interested in this.
The old team's games were high-tension and the people who wanted to watch those games weren't just the Scots.
I'll make it right, Deila swore
RONNY DEILLA: Celtic admitted they were struggling, but the Norwegian boss said the move would be reversed.
The defeat to Malmö and then the Champions League farewell was followed by a loss to the 10-man Aberdeen, who now lead the points table by five points.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad days in the past, we will return".
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are angry or upset about what happened.
We're in the same situation - but we have to keep going.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's reluctance to transfer in January
Despite comments he made just a couple of weeks ago setting some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is reluctant to sign, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt Ibrox's team unity.
The former Brentford coach said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
For players who come in the summer, you have a pre-season period to get them used to, and we've seen that in our own squad this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes it hurts more to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celtic Michu for retirement
Swansea forward Michu has been linked with Celtic in the transfer window, shattering predictions that he could retire when his contract with the Swans expires.
At the age of 29, he suffered excruciating pain from a problematic ankle for two years and could not find a way to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts are preparing for the SFA battle over Neilson's comments.
When Paterson was sent off, the Hearts were up 2-1 and then they lost 3-2, turning things upside down after a red card from the defensive player - Collum's third red card to be canceled in eight months.
Neilson does not back down, insisting: "I never questioned the unity, I never commented on the performance".
Griffiths tried to stop Tynecastle
The obsessed Hibee was reprimanded for singing a song that had offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, just before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby game and there was a heat of the moment", said the striker, adding: "I can say with certainty that I will not go to Tynecastle from now on except to play for Celtic.
Tannadice board has confidence in the Dundee United management.
Simon Donnelly, the Dundee United board is still confident that the management team will make things right - but they agree that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the kids ready to go again", Donnely said.
Mclness is pleased with the "ugly win" against Hamilton.
Derek Mclness admits Aberdeen's team had to hold on desperately against the Hamilton Accies to see their seventh consecutive win, which propelled them to the top of the league table by five points over Celtic thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
"There is no team that wins anything without winning games in this way, whether it is cups or leagues", said Mclnnes.
Unemployment rates in England have risen, but the rates among Scots have remained the same.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed across the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than the 5.5 per cent in England.
In Scotland, on the other hand, employment fell by 12,000 in three months to 2,612,000 today.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent - above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's been almost a full year since Scotland decided to remain part of England.
Over the last 12 months, we've seen improvements in the Scottish labour market with increased employment and decreased unemployment.
Why I Witnessed an Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, I'm going to watch a man be killed in a legal action.
I hope not, but if it does, I'll be sitting in the death chamber gallery at Oklahoma State Prison watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made through his best friend in January, and I accepted, shocked as I was.
As that day approached, I became afraid of it.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
It'll give you a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to cover executions in America, and with more applications than there are places, a terrible lottery is drawn to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has cut media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever gets elected will watch without feeling.
I can't do this.
I'm gonna sit next to some of Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a relationship with him over the past few months, through phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison officials said that I could not be a witness and a journalist, so I would not be given a pen and a notebook to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma tweeted that I compromised my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, gain access.
I complained to him.
He admitted that he "could have put it better", but he still thought what I was doing was wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me on some of the things I say and write.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could take me off the witness list any time he wanted.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to cover it.
If he dies, he thinks that spreading the word will help the anti-death penalty movement.
I'll be joined by a reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware.
If you want to learn more about this, please listen to the podcast series I've prepared.
I'm not going to go into all the details here.
I have no idea if Richard Glossip is innocent.
What he did after Barry Van Treese's death is enough to make him an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murder.
I believe there is absolutely no evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm gonna watch her death from that perspective.
I can't really claim to be objective.
You can check with the other reporters there.
The impression you'll get from me will be the same as you'll get from watching the death of a man he loved, killed needlessly.
After a wet police chase, the man was persuaded to leave Canning River.
Canning Vale police officer was paralyzed when he tried to persuade the man to get out of the Canning River.
A Perth man's claim to have escaped from a police car behind him ended in shallow and muddy water when a police officer tried to "convince him to gently return to shore".
Canning Vale Police were called to the scene of a break-in at Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, the man tried to run away from the police by going into the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"Veteran Deputy Shandell Castledine, standing in the water himself, said, 'I'm not coming out, come get me.'"
Police Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to get his uniform wet and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Senior Deputy Commissioner Castledine said "sometimes people try funny things to try to escape".
Champion football player Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to escape a police liquor check and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
Their efforts failed, but it inspired the locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon for fun.
Peter Moody claimed that the stewards had snitched on him and threatened to have him drop out of the race.
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria stewards tried to set up a mess in their barn last year and threatened to force him to leave the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted stewards and the union department, saying they were running a personal campaign against her to disqualify Lady Tatai in the final feed for the race on the pre-race Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do his best in racing, and told the business leader that he found himself in unexplainable straitened circumstances when he tested positive for cobalt.
He said he bit his tongue for 18 months over allegations of espionage because he didn't want to "look like a drunken grape".
"I wasn't gonna say it, and I kept you covered for a long time, but sometimes you get really angry and it all comes out of nowhere", Moody said.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you react and you suffer the consequences of it, and I will suffer the consequences of what I say.
I'll sleep well when I go home tonight.
I want to walk with my head up and let my bosses know that I'm trying to do the best I can for them.
When they start thinking I'm not doing it, I shouldn't be coaching anymore.
I was wondering what I was gonna do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had detonated a bomb in a racing.com interview accusing the unit department of being in a rat race in his barn.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I'll call him that if asked - and they offered him a job in my stables in exchange for telling them what I was doing in the stables", Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they all have to return their shorts because they weren't skilled enough to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL president, David Moodie, new RVL president, and the current RVL CEO knew it then, and they know it now.
Does that make me think it's getting personal?
RVL has a bunch of balls, and maybe they want to hold someone other than the trainers responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what I say will make them think.
But I don't care about anything when I get there, and that makes me sad.
It really upsets me.
I'm going to put pressure on them, make them responsible for making decisions.
I have the support of my family and I walk.
The operator's long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari and his frustration with the subsequent scratch incident led him to say, "Throw my license across the table".
Moody, who is famous for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day care rule "ridiculous", stating that it was against the rules to apply mud or clay to the horse's feet.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this".
One of my guys accidentally rubbed mud on her foot.
He could have gotten it last night.
He could have bought it yesterday, which he did.
He took the day of the race.
Moody could face a three-month ban for using a racing-day maintenance rack as a result of an investigation by the administrators.
This is a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We understand we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
The hit-and-run driver in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a hit-and-run driver in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the hit-and-run driver fled the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man named Nathalia turned himself in to the police station in Shepparton.
He's expected to be charged with failing to stop, failing to assist in an accident and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram remains in stable condition in hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has responded harshly to his opponents' claims about the wrestling match.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his own team as an attempt to "set the agenda" for the NRL's two favourite premierships.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees "allowed him to wrestle" with his own team in the game that saw the Storm beaten in the semi-finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a rather unambiguous reference to the Storm after their semi-final win over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling it a "lesson" for rugby league and saying the two Oueenslands were not "too big" in the fight.
Bellamy defended his team's fight, saying that when they fought, they were focused only on "contact".
Bellamy said he was empowered by the criticism coming from the two leading hockey teams, as this meant they were worried that the Storm would beat them.
This is coming on - I didn't hear Trent Robinson mention wrestling when they beat us 24-2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee you, we haven't changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year, only in the last six weeks we've put a real emphasis on our fighting contacts, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and obviously he's got a big team he's coached, and he's probably not used to losing with a little shock to himself.
Funny how this happens this time of year.
Bellamy objected to Bennett's idea of "exciting football", reminding him of his coach who won Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons championship by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He made a comparison between his game on Saturday night and our game on Friday night and how exciting their game was", Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 when St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he wouldn't even give a rat's ass.
But now they have a team that's going to play what we call exciting football, and especially their speed and their young half.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have these types of players.
He made that point in 2010, now everybody wants to play football that way -- every team doesn't have half-timers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that way.
It gives me more confidence because even they talk like that because they're a little bit afraid to play.
I don't think they'd have thought of us six weeks ago when they went to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters game had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good one, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the score?
Our game is 20-18, our game is more scores on both sides, but is that exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut the strikes but not score?
That's the agenda for me.
If they're talking about us, that means we'll meet them here at some point.
The Storm won't be here this weekend as they've won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in their first final game on Tuesday night at AAMI Park.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man who was caught with 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland and facing a possible life sentence has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five people arrested by federal police last month for tracking 100 kilograms of drugs from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and was docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with his accomplices at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a potential life sentence for possession of a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he attempted to possess all the drugs and that he may have been in the cafe with an innocent motive.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan worried that Maksimovic was at risk of absconding.
He has clear connections to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he was staying in a public case.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather together offered $200,000 for his release on bail.
Judge Flanagan said that "after reading the affidavits of both men, it is clear that the $200,000 bail amount is a real financial burden on them".
But he warned that this alone was not enough to keep him from going to trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail on the condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, and that he go to the police station every day and comply with the curfew from 6pm to 6am.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phones to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request child abuse videos.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was sleeping, logged onto an online messaging service and provided her with a series of inappropriate child images sent to her by another user.
She woke up later and realized she didn't have her phone, and she found it in Hogg's sleeping hands.
She looked at it and immediately noticed the disturbing messages before warning her mother.
The police took an interest and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches using terms aimed at finding inappropriate child images.
Hogg later claimed to officers that the reason for doing this was to "manage pedophiles on the internet" and "act like a cop and scare them".
Financial representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it was an addiction - an addiction that scared people.
He admitted the calls were made by the computer, but said he did it to act like a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
They asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who asked him to send more pictures.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said that when he drank, he got sick thoughts and wanted to watch rape and murder footage.
"When she found the texts on her phone", added Ms. Robertson, "she screamed at her mother and was trembling and crying.
Mom saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone, and the accusations followed.
She was interviewed and said she used a computer and a Playstation to look younger than the defendant.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to receiving or producing indecent images of children on 14 June last year, breaching bail on 25 January this year and failing to appear in court on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim said it was debatable whether Hogg was included in the category of sexual offences because there was no "clear sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the case until October when the social history report is due.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but was remanded in custody for other unusual cases.
He had a sex offender record before the sentencing date.
In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe made a speech in the parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of stairs earlier this year as he was descending a podium.
He was unhurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was marred by allegations that opposition MPs received anonymous death threats if they slandered Mr Mugabe during his speech.
He was booed and interrupted during his address to the nation last month in parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received messages on their mobile phones to stop Mr Mugabe from disturbing him during his speech.
"A message to journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech is over comes from an unseen number but the headline is 'death,'" he said.
He tells the members that their immunity is valid in parliament and when they leave parliament, the immunity doesn't work.
The chief spokesman expressed "concern" over threats against politicians of the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard will cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and cut costs in its corporate services business.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating its faster-growing computer and printer business from its hardware and services operations.
HP said in a statement that the expected layoffs would result in a cost of about $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
HP President and CEO Meg Whitman, who will lead the division after the split, said "these restructuring activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company".
"We will have a broader and deeper portfolio to help companies transition to a new way of doing business", Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a much better position than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will "focus on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" for companies.
He divides his Palo Alto garage into two parts, a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world's largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is one of the latest moves in the industry to believe that tight-focused companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates are having problems with Wilshere's injury before the Dinamo Zagreb game.
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury occurred in September and that his treatment was scheduled, there was no reason for him not to play in the Christmas line-up.
The best-case scenario already means Wilshere will definitely miss at least four matches in England and given his history it seems uncertain whether he will be able to take part in the European Championships next spring.
The most embarrassing aspect of the last problem is that Wilshere finished strong last season after suffering a separate ankle injury and then went back to his pre-season sharpness.
This kind of injury is not a career threat, Wenger said.
This is a bone that's not fully healed.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
It's not related to his wrists or any previous injuries.
From a medical perspective, that might be true, but as Wenger will admit, a player who makes a midseason comeback is at risk of further injury.
There's also a disturbing pattern developing.
According to research by Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different ailments recorded since his debut six years ago.
He's played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the last five seasons.
In the big picture Arsenal are one of only two Premier League teams to have lost six of eight seasons since 2007-08, mostly due to injury.
Wenger admits to a potential knee injury, but Arsenal believe recovery from last season's injury record will take time.
"Sometimes you go through a period of injury during your recovery from an injury, a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust that, and I believe he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal, who will start their Champions League battle against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, have matches against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing his team for them.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are playing.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players the breath they need", Wenger said.
Despite being Arsenal's clear favourite in Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most haunted stadiums in Europe.
Dynamo have been unbeaten for 41 games since last season when they produced their own "Defeat" campaign.
The stadium was rocked by a 3.2 on the Richter scale Tuesday night.
This is the 10th quake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned the lesson from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and remains motivated by the long-term goal of bringing the club its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge", says Wenger.
It's never been like this at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but I'm experienced enough to be realistic.
We are passionate, but we are not visionary.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us about male friendship.
The absence of similar portals in the programs is striking, especially at a time when men need more to open up and when suicide rates among young men are at their peak in the 15s.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 years, and it was three times more common in men than women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Campaign Against Living in Misery (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of the Man and aims to counter the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to accomplish this challenging task.
A study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that a person with depression had a double chance of recovery if he had a high number of "healthy-mode" friends.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the mental challenges that may arise.
But of course, for a friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In an age of social media dominated communication, with a focus on style over content, it's making immediate response more of a priority than meaningful communication.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look like strong, fun-loving, successful people, even if in reality it's all about isolation.
Dominated by what psychologists call externally driven values -- money, image, social status -- these are being pursued at the expense of intrinsic values that have a deeper impact on our mental health -- our innate desire for personal growth and friendship.
As a billionaire video game creator recently explained, money can't buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned that focus upside down.
The characters were defined not by their jobs but by their personalities, and they showed that by their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the minutes they spent in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross's attachment to Rachel all came from knowing that men could actually relate to them, even if they were in the background of fully expressing their feelings.
A helpful employee told me: "...listening to people with depression and suicidal tendencies, I learned how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference".
Most of the men who contact us can't talk to their friends.
The feeling of 'going through' is very strong, and so is the idea that opening up to others is a sign of weakness".
One of the programs that comes to mind when I suggest long-term coping mechanisms is Friends.
He highlighted the little moments of his boyhood.
In line with my goal, a stranger status on the phone helps people in their toughest moments, but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you're attending FriendsFest on Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes have been redesigned to celebrate?
Or, even better, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship will make.
Friends is on Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest.
Di Maria's goal made it easy for PSG to beat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal for Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easy for PSG to overtake the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday in the opening round of the Champions League.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
In a match where Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani are on target, Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League battle with a comfortable and clear 2-0 win over Malmö on Tuesday at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria was the PSG player who scored the goal before four minutes had passed, which allowed the French champions to continue their way in the Champions League, but they could not take advantage of the opportunities until Cavani's second goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, who are in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, not only to get out of the qualifying groups, but also to improve their quarter-final performance in the last three championships.
But their game in the points was not the best of the season for Laurent Blanc's team, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent too many positions around the penalty area and was later sidelined against his homeland team with whom he started his glorious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League, inside or out, and in that respect, winning 2-0 will create problems for our opponents and it's a good start to give us a comfortable image behind the line, although there are some things we need to improve during the season", Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
Even though I'm sorry we didn't score one or two more goals, we wanted to win and we did.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team with one of three substitutions in the 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Ligue 1 over the weekend after the injury, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was seen as a player who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was transferred from Manchester United last month and showed that those who thought so were not wrong when Marco Veratti's pass ran behind Malmö's defence and sent Johan Wiland to the wings from the far corner with a beautiful pass.
However, everyone was disappointed as PSG was expected to win a big victory.
Malmö, who eliminated Celtic in the play-offs to advance to this round, were lined up with nine internationals, a five-man defence and two players in the depth of the midfield, a heavy remaining opponent.
In the 34th minute, they made little attack except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot that hit the corner post, which was protected by Kevin Trapp.
PSG, on the other hand, allowed them to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and inefficient final shots, Ibrahimovic failed to make the final move in at least five attacks in the first half and disappointed by not keeping up with Cavani's play as the second half began.
However, he showed more skill when it came to organizing his teammates, it was Ibrahimovic who gave the pass of a false-hit that Di Maria sent to Wiland's keep in the 52nd minute.
The second goal came after a full hour, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season with a header that revealed Maxwell's left wing after Ibrahimovic's pass.
Malmö's chances of returning to the match were exhausted, and after a scoreless goal from Ezequiel Lavezzi, who came in late, Wiland saved David Luiz's free-kick perfectly and did not allow the score to change.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above their own team, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level as him.
The teams in the playoffs aren't enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore has generated $ 2.5 billion in sales of its stock.
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion by selling shares on Wednesday as part of a plan to split its debt.
Glencore, listed in London, announced it was selling new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, has been hit hard by falling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown has driven up demand and caused market turmoil.
The rights issue caused Glencore's stock prices to soar on the London Stock Exchange early Wednesday morning.
The shares opened 0.69% higher in the FTSE 100 index, rising 2.77%, to 131.60 pence.
Glencore announced last week a $2.5 billion stock sale as part of its plans to reduce its $30 billion debt pile by a third.
The company sold its new shares at 125 pence a share, a discount of 2.4 percent from Tuesday's close.
He sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about China's long-standing growth cut iron ore prices by roughly half, while coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping would pay an official visit to the United States later in the month.
The statement said Xi's first official visit to Washington would be on September 25 and would be a return visit to Barack Obama, who visited Beijing last November.
After bilateral talks between the two heads of state, US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
The statement also stressed that "President Xi's visit will expand U.S.-China cooperation on bilateral relations as well as regional and global issues and allow President Obama and President Xi to constructively address issues of disagreement".
Xi, who first announced his visit in February, is expected to visit Seattle before Washington to meet with some US technology leaders, before heading to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to discuss some contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over allegations of Chinese cyber espionage and China's claims to sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes it seem like diversity in filmmaking is irrelevant.
Matt Damon has challenged African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying it's not necessary to be behind the camera during a debate about diversity.
On the Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, which aired on HBO, Brown interrupted the veteran actor while stressing the need for alternative perspectives on the black lead character in the project's chosen script.
Damon argued that when we talk about diversity, you don't do it in the cast of the show, you do it in the cast of the movie.
Brown, shocked, reacted to the Martian actor's comments by saying, "Wow!
Damon and Brown were brought together by co-producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly to discuss the show's finalists.
Brown first said, "I wanted to get people thinking about how they would treat the character of Fitting, whoever the director is".
The only black character is a whore shot by a white chatterbox.
Dear White People's publisher insisted on the directing rights for the film, asking for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio, to be cast, to which Damon replied that their assignments "could end up the way we don't want".
After the debate was aired, there was an outpouring of dissatisfaction on social media over Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the cut, writing, "Matt Damon can explain his diversity about this person as painful to the WHITE JESUS because he's talking about the only black person in the room".
After the tweet was sent, it received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came at a time when the media's racial correctness is at the forefront of social debate.
After the 2014 killing of a young white police officer named Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement has been effective in urging lawmakers and officials nationwide to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince spoke out about the move at the Grammy Awards, where the Album of the Year nominees were announced.
He said the albums still matter.
Books and albums like Black Lives Matter are still important.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued a statement in response to a question from Fox News's Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a major figure, about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
The leaders said the Black Lives Matter Network is a charity.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in a list of entertainers, producers and media executives invited to visit the Pope to discuss the definition of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's not clear if he accepted the invitation or if he's meeting with the Pope.
The American Ninja Warrior has crowned his first champion.
Professional rock climber and comedian Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win a $1 million prize when he won the Ninja Warrior of America program on Monday night.
The contest, now in its seventh season, had never before seen a contestant complete all the stages of the obstacle course.
In the season finale, Caldiero and Geoff Britten managed to make it to the final round.
The last task was to climb a rope about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the course in time, thus becoming the first athlete to complete the challenging 4th stage of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero won the race by finishing three seconds ahead of him.
After this tough win, Caldiero spoke to E!News in shock about winning the grand prize of $1 million.
Isaac told E! about a huge raise in his salary, "I think it's amazing to think about it, I've never made or lived on more than $10,000 a year".
I mean, it just happened... I can't imagine how it's gonna be... the future is unknown.
Producer Kent Weed also spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and explained why Britten was the first contestant to finish the track, but no prize was awarded.
The rules say the fastest gets the money.
Weed said, "The one who finishes more than one, wins the prize for the fastest one".
And while the money was a great reward and a life-changing one, he won a big prize.
I don't think he has a bad idea about this.
He's very happy about what he did.
He got tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a family man.
He's a hero to his wife and kids.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone's going to beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac".
I think if their roles had changed, Isaac would have felt the same way.
American Ninja Fighter has renewed for an eighth season, and filming will begin in Spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers have just beaten the Minnesota Twins by a whopping .
The second half of the season hasn't been very good for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers, who had reduced their game to a disruption, put on a perfect game Tuesday, defeating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins have lost their chance to advance to the American League Wild Card round by over a half-point gap to the Houston Astros.
For Detroit, it was a return to a good game that was rarely seen for much of the second half of the season, even for one night.
In the words of Tigers manager Brad Ausmus, "victories are all fun, no matter how they turn out".
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon, showing early offensive support with Detroit scoring three times on the first two hits, managed to score a run on the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) has 6 3/1 consecutive hits, three of which were runs.
That was only the third quality start of the last nine rounds.
"I just want to end the year strong", Simon said.
It's hard for the reserves to throw every game away, so I wanted to dive in.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hitter of the four-hitter on July 6 against the Seattle Mariners.
"He waved the bat hard", said Ausmus.
He looked good, he was already noticeably better at BP, which he kept in the game.
The Twins, who had three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, had their best chance to get back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton opened the batting line with a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks was able to make only a slow hit, and Simon caught second baseman Brian Dozier swinging for a hit before lifting it for left fielder Blaine Hardy.
Mauer, the only player who could face right-winger Drew VerHagen in the two-run, bravely advanced to face slugger Miguel Sano.
In the second-to-last run, with a pair of runners, VerHagen managed to draw third baseman Trevor Plouffe into a double play.
Plouffe's hit to the DP was his 27th in the majors this season.
After Detroit fought back for the run that would guarantee ninth, Mauer passed the RBI and tied the Tigers, making it 5-4, closing in on Bruce Rondon.
However, Sano was caught in three throws for the right fifty-fifth save.
Detroit has taken the lead with Phil Hughes out early, out of form.
The Tigers have won three runs in their first two shots against an experienced right-hander who has been out of the field for more than a month with a back injury and has just come out of injury.
"Obviously, this is not the game I wanted to play", Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable and I managed to make some pretty good shots in the third set".
After a successful first down, Hushes took out second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Two outs by right fielder J.D. Martinez left Victor Martinez alone on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez raced the runners to overcome the 0-21 band in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to make a third, ending the threats.
The Tigers added a second, a pair of outs from catcher James McCann and a two-out from center Anthony Gose, making it 3-0.
"It was a big hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit it very well, but he hit it right.
Hughes, the shooting guard, made three scoreless innings before being replaced by right-handed saves A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and four walks.
NOTE: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez has been sidelined with a shoulder injury.
He'll be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the disabled list since mid-August with shoulder pain, is scheduled to start work on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, the Twins will face the LHP with Daniel Norris DL.
Norris and the Tigers are 1-1 in four games since the July 30th game for David Price.
He hasn't played since August 20th due to pain in his right side.
The Tigers and Twins will end their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face off against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) who is currently in the starting rotation.
Xi wants to open up the economy more to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with guiding reforms that the economy needed to open more to the outside in order to accelerate growth.
At the meeting of the 16th Central Leadership Group to Strengthen General Reforms, the President said, "China should develop opening policies by attracting foreign investment expertise".
Xi said that while promoting opening up, new reforms would bring new energy and vitality and create a new area for economic growth.
The leader group adopted a series of proposals, including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to add private capital, and a review of the registration system for settlers.
According to the statement, a negative list will be prepared that identifies sectors and business branches forbidden for investment.
The system will be tested and improved through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources and make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also loosen its control over corporations, allowing them to run their own businesses.
The statement also said that China will explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation in border regions and put in place new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
More space will be opened up to private investment to open up state-controlled sectors.
The statement said, "the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment, and will protect the interests of foreign-funded companies by providing them with better services".
In addition, the requirements for obtaining permanent residence permits or "green cards" will be streamlined and the application process streamlined.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the rights of lawyers to practice and training professional judges and prosecutors.
According to a statement issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
Miniature bag is now very fashionable-time newspaper Saturday
In the fashion world, roads go round and round and come to bags.
The trend of recent years is the miniature ones...
The small bags attached to the adults are also noticeable.
They say the little things are beautiful.
I guess that's the same way you look at bags.
When I couldn't get enough of walking the streets with bags the size of suitcases, the wind suddenly started blowing in the opposite direction and the bags tended to get smaller.
There were small bags, but this time they came in miniature versions of the large ones.
These tiny bags can only hold your phone, credit card, and keys.
The movement that started with Céline and Hermès spread with Prada.
The transformation of the bag into a miniature curiosity has also affected the newly released models.
Loewe has introduced the fun bags he's been making this season in two sizes.
Among the panda, polar bear, and elephant-shaped bags, the most elephant-like ones stand out.
The miniature size of the big bags, which are offered by luxury brands with phenomenal names, again seem to have attracted the most red carpet celebrities.
The Birkin bag, which Hermes made for Jane Birkin, is a favorite.
Although Jane Birkin said in a press release that she didn't want her name remembered in a bag, that's how it's stuck in the memory.
And fashion weeks have made mini bags popular.
And the podiums are full of mini bags.
They're so small, you can't wear them on your arm.
They can be used in a cross-section with long hangers.
But on the catwalks, we've seen those long suspenders wrapped around the models' wrists.
Fendi is the one who pushes the mini-bag thing to the next level.
He has a suggestion for those who can't fit in a mini bag but can't give them up.
Big bags are for friends, mini bags.
How's that?
By turning mini bags into a little ornament that can be attached to the big ones.
This performance, which was highlighted on the podium, has quickly been replicated on the street.
Let's see what else we can see!
Skin change in the denim
Turkey is on a level to compete with world brands in terms of denim.
He's now enriching this experience with design.
Loft is one of them.
We're seeing black models, who used to be a few, starting to make their way onto the shelves every season.
In a season when blacks are so up and running, denim has found its best friend.
Leather pieces and leather- detailing designs stand out as the rebellious friend of denim.
In general, short models with zippers called "motorbikes" are popular.
The strong skin is complemented by black clothing, long blouses and glossy sweaters, which add a sporty look.
Used to be, teenagers wore denim and wanted to disappear into the crowd.
Thought it would save the day.
Now, teenagers want to wear a piece that's as comfortable as it is elegant.
From this perspective, it's possible to say that Loft has a good understanding of his target audience with the collections and complementary pieces he has created.
Small for Banksy, big for the global
The world premiere of the collection "The Art of Banksy", which brings together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, took place in Istanbul.
The exhibition, which is the product of the artist's 15 years of work and the first time 85 original works have been brought together, is the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building.
The first exhibition of the mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul opened the day before in Global Karaköy (Rıhtım Caddesi).
The world-famous artist, who hides his identity and uses a pseudonym, was not present at the opening, of course.
We don't even know if he's been to Istanbul.
But according to the curator of the exhibition, Steve Lazaridas, Bansky doesn't even know about the exhibition.
There's no reason to ask her permission.
Because old friends Bansky and Lazaridas parted ways after 12 years.
Some of the exhibits are from Lazaridas, some from collectors.
But there are some things that Bansky's followers are curious about.
What would Banksy think of the exhibition "The Art of Banksy", which brings together 85 works?
For example, how would she feel about the admission fee? What if she saw the small store at the end of the 800-square-foot gallery space?
Would she have been able to make out that her works, which call attention to the wounds of the world, like Girl with the Red Balloon, the Cleaner, Rose Now, were printed on cloth bags, wallets, necklaces?
The fact that an exhibition by an artist with an anarchist spirit who hides his identity has been made into such a consumer product is a disappointment to Banksy's followers.
That's not Banksy.
But you still get a limited number of tickets before they're sold out!
The big exhibition, "The Art of Banksy", for Banksy's small, globalized world, is on view through April.
These are the lowest of the low.
If they go, they can dig a ditch.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued his reaction to the academics who signed the declaration.
Erdogan said, "These are cruel, these are low".
Indeed, the companions of the wrongdoers are the wrongdoers.
"They were guilty of the same crime because they were with the murderers".
"I shared our sorrow with the German President and the German Chancellor for the deaths of 10 of our German friends in this action in Sultanahmet Square, a peace square that smells of history and civilization - especially near the German Fountain.
I would like to extend my condolences to the entire German people and first of all to the families of the dead".
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination", he said.
Erdogan continued his reaction to the academics who signed the statement, saying: "I especially condemn, I strongly condemn, the academics who stood up to all these terrorist incidents and published a black statement and signed under those massacres".
It doesn't make anyone understand who our nation is much better, that is, having a professor, an associate professor in front of you.
These are the people of darkness.
These are the wrongdoers, the lowliest.
They're guilty of the same crime because they were with the murderers.
Where will these dark academics put the three-year-old Mevlüt, who was martyred with her father in the incident in Çınar?
How do they make it their conscience to join his killers?
I call upon all the judiciary, the senate of the universities to take action against these actions contrary to our constitution and laws.
Yesterday, I said the steps needed to be taken must be taken quickly.
Let these guys do whatever they want to do.
Those who want to do politics should do it in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, they should go dig a ditch or climb a mountain.
I'm speaking so clearly.
TEOG results are out

'I found 26 guys looking for two wrestling boys'
The second documentary by Mete Gümürhan is "Young Pehlivanlar", 66.
He was the first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February).
Gümürhan, who is originally from Edirne but has a production company in the Netherlands, explained why and how he shot the documentary, which he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivanos", which tells the story of a six-year-old boarding school student from Amazia who aspires to become a world champion in wrestling, will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Pehlivanlar, the first Turkish documentary to be selected for this category, is one of the nominees for the Crystal Bear award.
Mete Gümürhan is a Dutch filmmaker, born and raised in Edirne.
When he was a kid, he used to listen to greasy wrestling stories from his grandfather in Turkey, where he came for summer vacation, and watch the races.
"There are not only political problems in Turkey".
I wanted to tell the world what else was going on in Anatolia.
"For example, horse wrestling is unfortunately not well known in our country", he wants to get together with six directors to make a documentary project.
This project is fruitless, but one day a magazine story he reads on the plane opens the door to another project for Gümürhan.
'We stayed at the sugar factory'
Mete Gümürhan, a 10-11 year old wrestler, tracks the story of two younger brothers and goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The kids' father won't let them shoot for the documentary.
Gyumirhan explains how she overcame this challenge: "I spent the whole day thinking about what I could do.
Because the support from the Ministry of Culture could be withdrawn".
Dad mentioned in the interview a boarding school in Amasya where the kids were going.
I've been thinking about going there.
I was looking for two kids and I met 26 kids who were into wrestling at school.
We started shooting in a week and finished the vacation.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the dormitory of the sugar factory".
The film was completed in three weeks and the language was the biggest challenge for the director.
Gümürhan said that the foreign director and voiceover were working on a set where three different languages were spoken.
"They didn't know Turkish either", he says.
Young Wrestlers focuses on the stories of six of the 26 child wrestlers.
Baran, who was raised by his grandfather and has a weight problem, Harun, who can't go to training because he broke his arm, Beytullah, ambitious but in poor health, the cute schoolboy Umit, the youngest champion Ahmet and Muhammad, who keeps the group together...
Mete Gümürhan describes her work with children: "I left them completely natural".
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I was shooting for the first week and a half of practice.
I wanted the kids to pretend there were no cameras.
"Fortunately, they got used to it quickly".
It was a surprise to be chosen for Berlin.
Mete Gümürhan said that he did not expect Young Pehlivan to be selected for the Berlin Film Festival.
Teenage Mutants is not a sports documentary, it's a film about the struggles of kids and their lives.
"I wanted to highlight the stories of children with family problems struggling to find identity and cope with their problems", she says.
Support for academics from the art world
The storm that broke out yesterday after the statement of the "Academics for Peace Initiative" led to the investigation and detention of academics, but on the other hand, there are also statements of support.
The first support came from literary figures, including many famous names.
The day before, the filmmakers announced their support, and yesterday, the theaters announced their support.
In a statement signed by 138 actors, the statement reads, "We, as artists working in the field of theatre and performing arts, stand with this honorable gathering of Academicians who are calling for peace, we declare that we are with freedom of expression, equality, right to life and unconditional peace".
"We join with our conscience and our whole heart the call of academics for dialogue and peace".
More than 400 filmmakers including Deniz Türkali, Atilla Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbacak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Onur Ünlü, Yşim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik said, "We are with free thought and art.
But without but without if you said, "We will not participate in this crime!"
We are with the Academicians for Peace Initiative".
The Society of Cinema Writers (SIAAD) also issued a statement saying "We stand with the academics who have been targeted by the lynching campaign".
The Academics for Peace Initiative issued a statement titled "We are not partners in this crime" with simultaneous statements in Ankara and Istanbul on January 11.
The text was signed by 1,128 academics from 89 universities, as well as world-renowned thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, and others.
President Erdogan and Prime Minister Davutoglu criticized the statement of academics as "supporting terrorism", calling the institutions to "do their duty".
After this call, some universities stopped academics from working, while the prosecutor's office had launched an investigation.
Yesterday, a large number of academics were detained.
My fan, please help!
The red hair of Hürrem Sultan, the nose of Beren, the hair of Justin...
While trying to be like a celebrity is considered normal to a certain extent, it's considered a psychological disorder once it starts to affect your life in its entirety.
Celebrity worship syndrome, also known as celebrity worship syndrome, is a topic that has already become an academic topic around the world, but we're just starting to talk about it.
It's fairly normal for ladies to run into hair salons with famous photos.
But let's not forget the year of Hurrem Sultan when all the teenagers walk around Ireland with red hair.
We've already heard that the 'Beren's nose' is the top beauty surgeon in 2015.
It's not much different on the gentlemen's side.
For a time, it was common to dress like Polat Alemdar.
Now the opposite wind is blowing.
We're surrounded by Justin Bieber duplicates.
So much so that the information we quoted above has been read thousands of times online: "First, when you go to the barber, cut the sides of your hair, above the ears and around the top of your head".
The single sides will be short.
After the cutting is complete, you should shape your hair with a light water.
Once the shaping is complete, apply a hair spray to your hair.
"Justin, you have to shape your hair when it's wet to get it".
All of this brings to mind the newly emerging celebrity worship syndrome, which has become an academic topic around the world.
Celebrity fans are seen as a love interest in our country.
Artists boast about their fan numbers, how much they've influenced them.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see the situation that simple.
It is especially controversial that teenagers decide what to eat and drink, what to listen to, what to wear based on celebrities.
Over-commitment to unattainable names is defined as role-model psychosis.
Specialist psychologist Sümeyye Demir admits that Turkey is lagging behind in this field.
But he also notes that families are gradually becoming more aware: "One of the fundamental questions of psychological science is that of being at peace with oneself, of being at peace with one's own identity".
It used to be that kids filled their rooms with posters, dressed up as someone, they didn't take it seriously.
That's changing now.
He feels the need to intervene with his parents.
"Passionate commitment is a sign that something is wrong in a young person's life".
Fans on the emotional speed train
Interest in celebrities is harmless, as long as you don't go too far.
Iron suggests that we focus on the signs of his dislike of marriage, his jealousy of his wife, his preference for her dress.
We're talking about famous people.
It's normal to worry about them, to be concerned about their lives.
But according to the expert, the teenagers who miss the point are often: "When there are no names in the family or the community to represent the child in terms of virtue and good behavior, the void is certainly filled".
Good examples don't always come up.
"He's copying the bad guys, kid".
When we ask them how to approach it, Sumaye Demir starts by reminding us that celebrity-obsessed syndrome is more common in adolescence.
The problem is easier to solve when you consider that teenagers may be insecure.
We see young people who complain about their family's limitations but also want support and affection: "We have to take into account their emotional ups and downs".
New research shows that they struggle because of changes in their brains.
"The young man's passionate attachment to someone on the emotional speed train should be welcomed naturally, approached gently".
It is possible to change behavior
Psychologist Sumaye Demir recalls the tasks parents have to overcome the syndrome of celebrity worship:
Recognize his emotional distress, make sure you're calm before you get into it.
Never let him suppress your feelings.
To encourage independence, show respect for his admiration.
Instead of teaching with a rebuke, set a good example by discussing names that will serve as role models.
Try to discuss the place of celebrities in our daily lives together.
It would be useful to read books about the real world of celebrities together.
Make sure you communicate in an adult-to-adult fashion.
Remember, addiction and motivation use the same pathways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are opportunities for change, accepting them as they are.
Make sure you get expert help with the fancy stuff.
The angry and the envious admire
The underlying cause of celebrity-worship syndrome is the need to seek support and help from others.
Unrequited love is a cry for help.
But unfortunately, it doesn't seem that way.
Moreover, the problem is so widespread that it cannot be confined to one country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoğlu points out that in every country there are certain names who occupy television.
The syndrome is more about being attached to these celebrities: "They're extraordinary".
The general majority cannot afford them.
And the people who have it can't live like it.
Either they didn't adopt or they didn't dare.
"But he keeps watching with nervousness, those who don't have the means, who can't live like them".
It doesn't matter if you're jealous or angry.
They're both admirers from the inside.
They make money effortlessly, they're on the magazine's agenda.
Just knowing that's enough to boost the fan base.
Another advice from expert psychologist Sumaye Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this very point.
It should not be overlooked that artificial life is at stake.
The support of the community for the celebrity-obsessed person comes into play.
But the person insists on admitting that the celebrity he's a fan of has problems like his own.

Should I have a gallbladder surgery?
Dr. Fevzi Özgönül is answering questions in his column in the Maidan Gazete.
I have a gallstone, and every morning when I get up, I go to the bathroom with a stomachache after meals, two or more times a day.
Could it be that it's keeping me from losing weight?
I'm on alkaline now, but I'm not losing any weight.
I've been like this since I was a kid.
What am I supposed to do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
ANSWER: Gallstones are often accompanied by an infection.
These complaints of abdominal pain that occur immediately after eating are also a sign that when you eat, your gallbladder contracts and you empty the inflamed bile into your intestines.
The intestines, which are disturbed by the inflamed bile, quickly try to expel it.
That's why you go to the bathroom so much.
And because you go to the bathroom so much, your food is wasted and you lose weight slowly.
I think you should get this treated.
If you go to a gastroenterologist and they diagnose what I'm talking about, you can get rid of it with antibiotics.
But eventually, you may have to have gallbladder surgery.
The alkaline probiotic may reduce your symptoms a little, but it doesn't.
I say you keep the alkaline probiotics, no matter what.
Because the biggest help in losing weight is this probiotic powder.
I eat too much when I'm stressed.
When I'm stressed and nervous, I eat myself to death and gain weight.
How can I deal with this?
ANSWER: An overeating craving is actually a lack of energy.
This may be because of under-eating or skipping breakfast and lunch.
Another reason is that you don't digest the food you eat.
For that to happen, your digestive system must be functioning properly.
If you don't have ulcers or reflux or something like that, the easiest way is to take a good probiotic.
You'll see the benefits.
I'm not gaining weight, the doctors don't know why.
There's usually information in your corner about weight loss.
It all makes sense to me, but my situation is a little different.
I'm not gaining any weight.
And most importantly, I don't know why.
He doesn't say anything at the doctors.
ANSWER: The techniques we use are not just for weight loss, but to restore the body to its ideal size by restoring physiological function.
Obesity and weakness are the same kind of disorders.
The same technique is used to treat obesity and weight loss.
And you'll lose weight when you eat sweet and sour foods.
I guess you've got that figured out by now.
You can be stimulated by carboxypuncture and gain weight with a healthy diet.
So you've weakened away from your ideal body.
Our other patients have also lost weight from their ideal bodies.
You gain weight to reach your ideal body, they lose weight to reach their ideal body.
If the system problem is solved, you gain weight, they lose weight.
But first, the system must work properly.

A child who feels worthless becomes a "hater"
There are certain emotions that are innate in the human sensory world.
Fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, anger, worry.
But feelings of hatred, resentment, and revenge develop in children over time and as a result of some wrong attitudes.
Every human being needs to be individual, including childhood.
So he wants to respect his parents' decisions and his social circle, and he wants to be asked about his concerns and to feel valued.
Providing these is the foundation of a healthy personality.
For example, behaviours that involve making decisions for the child (such as what to wear and eat) or that ignore the child's wishes and insist on his or her own (such as sending a child to a soccer class to learn musical instruments) show a lack of respect for the child's personality.
Since the child is not respected for his or her identity and existence, the defense mechanism develops anger and hatred to protect him or her, since he or she loses the freedom to be himself.
"Because anger and hatred are actually the opposite of acceptance", says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says that by hating, the child is trying to tell himself and those around him that he is not accepting what is being done to him, but that he is valuable.
The expert psychologist notes that the child's unacknowledged and unresponsive behavior is a positive development in his personality, "and the hatred here is 'I am too,' serving the purpose of preserving the child's self-esteem".
"If the child is allowed to be an individual, the hatred disappears", he says.
The child tries to protect himself by resorting to anger and hatred
Arslan says that at a young age, when children are most vulnerable both physically and mentally, parents may feel neglected and invisible when they are exposed to verbal and emotional violence by their environment.
"Sometimes it's just not meeting their emotional needs (caressing their hair, hugging and kissing them, taking care of their school or other needs), and sometimes it's not meeting their physical needs (food, drink, shelter, school, etc.) ", continues Arslan.
It's an upbringing that opens the door to anger or hatred.
Emotional and verbal violence includes humiliation, abuse, scorn, reprimand, unnecessary and severe punishment, making one feel worthless, and shouting.
These behaviors are deeply personal.
"The child either loses self-esteem by accepting them and spends his life struggling with feelings of worthlessness, unlovability, and inadequacy or tries to protect himself by resorting to anger and hatred".
His teacher gave Boyko to Cradle!
Dnipro, where Beşiktaş wants to take two footballers, is preparing for the second half in Antalya Belek.
Technical Director Myron Markevych spoke to the broadcasting organization about 27-year-old Denys Boyko, who is on the Black-White list.
"If the two clubs agree, I will be happy if Boyko goes to Beşiktaş and makes him champion", said Markevych, who praised the national elephant guard.
The 64-year-old coach also mentioned the situation of Brazilian stopper Douglas Silva Bacelar, born in 1990, whom President Fikret Orman and his institutions plan to transfer.

The eagle, who has topped the Turkish Cup Group C, has turned his eyes to the Super League.
In week 18, the preparations for the match of Mersin Sports Yurt, which will be played tomorrow at Başakşehir Stadium, have begun.
The football club will go to the Constitutional Court for the score that was erased.
Denizlispor will seek the right of the Arbitration Board of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) to cancel its 3 points on the grounds that it did not meet the financial criteria by making an individual application to the Constitutional Court.
Denizlispor President Mustafa Şavluk said that the arbitration board's decision is final and will be taken to the Constitutional Court.
"The way of justice is exhausted".
Legal entities can apply.
The arbitration board was supposed to make a decision in three months.
The Arbitration Board's Working Instructions required that the reasoned decision be announced within three months.
It's been four months since our application.
If the Constitutional Court says, 'There's a violation here,' it could turn in our favor.
He said, "We're not gonna stop chasing you".
Shavluk added that his application could be a first in the sports community.

Romania is moving to transparency in election spending
A new bill is being drafted in Romania to establish the exact source of election money and to set an upper limit on spending.
The government wants to make the donations of individuals and companies that sponsor politicians in elections more transparent.
The bill also provides for the 'decision money' used in elections to be preempted.

PEN writers asked Cameron to bring to the table the decline in press and freedom of expression in Turkey in his meeting with Davutoğlu.
Leading writers in Britain have sent a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron asking him to bring up the decline in press and freedom of expression in Turkey during his visit to London next week.
The letter, written by 25 writers, including the presidents of the International Writers Union (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, expressed serious concerns about "unprecedented repression of freedom of expression in Turkey".
The journalists cited the attacks on the offices of the newspaper, the raids and seizure of the Koza İpek Media Group as examples.
The letter from the writers, including Tom Stoppard, Ali Smith, Ian Rankin, and Elif Shafak, a PEN member, highlighted the arrest of three journalists working for Vice News, the prosecution of other journalists and the ongoing arrests of journalists.
The authors, who expressed concern about the arrest of Jan Dündar and Erdem Gül in the investigation stage, said: "It is vital that journalists in Turkey fulfill their essential duties in society, allowing them to inform the public without being censored".
He noted that attacks on journalists, writers and publishers undermine the freedoms of all Turkish society.
He said that due to the widespread "culture of immunity", journalists and writers are subjected to suspicious methods that go as far as physical attacks.
The authors pointed out that the number of Turkish citizens being sued for "insulting the president" has increased and that after Erdogan was elected in 2014, he filed more insult cases than all his predecessors put together.
Davutoğlu's words are spoken
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, who will visit London next week, is one of the few government members to express support for press freedom.
The letter states, "Therefore, Davutoglu's visit to London is an important opportunity to clearly commit to freedom of expression in Turkey".
The authors asked Cameron to call on Prime Minister Davutoglu to ensure that his government respects Turkey's obligations to freedom of expression.
The letter was signed by 25 authors:
