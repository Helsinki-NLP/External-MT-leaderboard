Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third-largest economic nation.
Plans for a stronger core-technical cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrested 20-Year-Old After Rapid Motorcycle Hunting
A motorcycle was captured after the driver had run it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they watched a 125 km/h fuel station leaving on the Bathdate Road.
Police reports that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued to drive on the Burgess Road before he drove to the Buschland, where officials lost it out of the eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person that matched the driver's description were later seen at a house on the Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karratha accuses a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal as well as careless driving.
He will appear before the official court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was saved and arrested for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the accusation at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of rape a woman on June 7, 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
The accusation is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, slept, and could not sign consent."
Webster is also accused of rape a second woman on May 4, 2014 at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reflection on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have presented a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil law.
“As trade unions die, the middle-class jobs also die,” said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I am proud to present the Employee Enforcement Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This striking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination due to the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti- trade unions.
The supplementation of the national labour law to create a possibility for discriminated workers to organize a trade union representation, to complain before a civil trial for justice - and to obtain compensation or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill proposes is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the reverses that have been exposed to the trade unions in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country – Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and observe labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and union law in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that should ensure that the militarized autocracy would replace Hedki Tojos with democracy.
Being fully aware that the workers and their trade unions play a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that “the workers’ rights to union and joint negotiations and action are guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: “The right to establish associations in order to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to shrink it are null and null; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Human Rights Commission, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country told other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to establish a trade union – and that it then may participate in collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government agencies – should be protected.
After these rights have been shattered in America, it is indeed very wise to regain the American ideal, so the working people must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standard of millions of people, labour has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
The story is remembered, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights – and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers’ representations – has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and promised democracy.
Judges suspend temporary law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, from which lawyers say it would likely have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was drawn up by Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, in June and intended to enter into force on 1 September, would force the doctors performing abortions to obtain a patient reception right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions temporarily while applying for such a right.
“The prosecutors can continue to work in accordance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights,” Federal judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge to make a more durable decision on the law.
Abortion defenders welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors spend so more time to obtain hospitalization rights.
“Today’s decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping from a wicked law that wants to take their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state to suspend the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment extended to the doctors from the two clinics who did not join the complaint and had also requested the right of introduction.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi as unconstitutional.
The key points of a Texas law that would have forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that the instructions rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents argue that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient entry rights, the Center for Reproduction Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to no longer carry out abortions, this doctor would no longer carry out the operation due to fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their requests for patient entry rights would still be ongoing.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher mortality rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video homage to her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural areas of Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-sickness as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer had already been further advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspect a delayed diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for it.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to somewhat resist the distances, it proposed as a possible remedy a enhancement of the service of registered doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of the geographical status, showed a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer and emphasized the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret falling household owners
The decline along with an increased decline in the number of household owners under the age of 35 could lead to garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds per year when today’s young consumers, according to a HTA study, according to the Financial Times, reach the “core age group for garden products”.
The report states that renters spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people spend with their own home for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting gardens for parking purposes and the decreasing garden size are other factors that threaten the industry in which an estimated £5 billion annually is implemented in sales.
In the large London area, where over a six-year period the share of household owners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can’t draw plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden counselor for the RHS said: “Container gardens are very popular among tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "gold age" of garden retail trade due to increased household owners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted a better market situation for this year due to the better weather after unpleasant weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, about 1,000 protesters struck the state television channel PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers would have been able to push the protesters out of PTV buildings.
The broadcaster started its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now sending again.
At the same time, approximately 3,000 protesters tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away from it, they delivered collisions with security forces equipped with stakes and stones.
The police installed drunk gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refuses.
The army of the country, however, calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without waste of time and using it without violence."
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been pushing more frequently.
Opposition politician Imran Khan has accused Prime Minister Sharif of having deceived the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests escalated this weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters to move to Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country’s oldest U.S. diplomats to inform a report about U.S. and British spying in Turkey.
Vice Prime Minister Bülent said the business operator of the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept that the results of the former U.S. analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a main area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said all major countries spy each other.
An earlier report that the main intelligence agency of Germany, Ankara, also had in vision, caused significantly worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: locker drivers threaten with consequences for pendlers
The federal warning strike of the locomotive drivers on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The distance announced for 18 to 21 hours affects all transport companies across the country, including the remote, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is the goods traffic.

The district chairman of the German Lokomotive Leader Union (GDL), Sven Schmitte, said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is the goods traffic.
The German Railway in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL has not said where they want to strike, so it’s hard to predict the consequences concrete.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
The prosecutors submitted on Friday to the Mallorca Prosecutor's Office evidence of persecution by police and staff of the city of Calvià.
The head of the police of Calvià on the Holiday Island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners in the famous binge-drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors submitted evidence for persecution by police and staff of the city of Calvià to the office of the Prosecutor's Office for Anti-Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are interrogated by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily newspaper ABC that the angry nightclub owners stated that the government’s wheat industry had a serious impact on their.
“It’s no longer about earning money, it’s about survival,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our basis of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international tracks this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing a 18-year-old British tourist who performed Fellatio on 24 men during a sailing tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the irregular behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the famous alcoholic boat tour.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatiovfall took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage had to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist site Magaluf, which is popular among young British tourists, is also known for a number of accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with strong views and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 a.m., another 5mm rain fell to the city, after 6.6mm, which had already landed in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy shakes, including a rainfall, which began shortly before 20 p.m. and provided for 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided a early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city on Monday fell again to a maximum of just 15.8°C.
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft had to land shortly after 19:30, but was hit by a wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start.
Winds at that time reached about 50 km/h on the ground at the Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to start during a second landing flight and eventually set up around 20:40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is forecast on Tuesday, with possible sights.
Matthies says it’s time for big networking
Given the galoping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switch centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this here, my eyes fall on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But behind it is a thought: If the cable wasn’t, in the shortest time all the listeners would fly around the house, and that would be much more retro.
Is it the e-electronic (electronic) system?
No, tip error: electronic) sector purchased the rule that the world news of today is the electrical breakdown of tomorrow - outdated.
And whoever, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, he simply says that he fundamentally refuses television.
Why these considerations?
Because the IFA’s move on the radio tower this week reads our absolute incompetence in electronics matters.
The Laie, who previously blindly mastered the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread before him with an incomprehensibly negle expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Is it still going?
What to talk about with people who seem to voluntarily spread such Quark?
For about 20 years, it is essentially about connecting our house.
In order for the yogurt to reserve itself, so that the firemaker informs us during the holidays on the Maldives that it burns in the workroom.
And would it not be wonderful if we get from the office from the air conditioner to our soon arrival ...?
This requires a air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: we raise our armband clock, say you loudly "Suy!" - and at home the dust dust robot runs out.
is wrong.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: “The boundaries between white and brown goods disappear,” a industry expert rotates, you can connect the washing machine with a headset, the vaporizer sends the weather report and the data glass shows how long the pizza in the bakery will still take, but that’s nothing useful because we’re in the stain.
From the daily practice we also know: If a neumodic device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What is another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive even the next sound positions.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after they spent the summer in air protection rooms, while rocket and murder strikes settled on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the struggles.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel, drawn by missile bombers, but the signs of the struggles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the staff of the "Pashosh" childhood garden, which was hit by a rocket, removed before the students arrived, granate breaks from the walls and shuttles.
“We’re a bit afraid, but we’re excited,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need the return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit funny" to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we’ve not gone out of the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire cease the war last week stopped, thousands of residents of the border communities such as Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the missile and murder fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murder granate, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city near Gaza, which is hard drawn by the Palestinian shooting.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, “We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on Tuesday on an unlimited cessation of weapons.
The ceasefire resulted in an immediate end of the struggles, but important issues remain unresolved, such as the Hamas’ demands of an abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re-opening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battle.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to the Palestinians and the UN estimates.
Israel denies these statements and estimates that at least half of the dead are fighters, but has not provided any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza launched 4,591 missiles and murder granates during the struggles to Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza Strip and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were transformed into temporary protective premises.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective areas and the struggles continue, the educational authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will soon be reopened so that we can continue to learn like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza.
After elections in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl disputes NPD ban proceedings
In light of the voting losses of the NPD in Saxony, CDU Vice-President Thomas Strobl has called for the end of the ongoing NPD prohibition proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU deputy Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," Strobl, who is also the CDU landscape in Baden-Württemberg, told Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD is politically fought and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed at the five-percent barrier on Sunday’s vote.
A first launch for a ban by the extreme right party was failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at that time also had informants in the NPD headquarters.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not agree.
Harburg: Camps for New Refugees
In New Zealand Square, refugees are now housed in halls.
The Central First Reception for Refugees in Harburg is broken from all nights.
Now the internal authority has placed three cells of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were only briefly informed - they are little enthusiastic.
“These Hauruck actions continue to shake citizens’ reservations and do not give district politicians the possibility to participate constructively in the human accommodation of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, head of the Green Group at the Harburger District Assembly.
Your party calls for the Harburg District Administration to provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tables.
The reasons for the overflow in the first enrollment are the rise of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities are unable to provide sufficient places in subsequent facilities.
Therefore, many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for own households in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
This increase leads to a total increase of 4.2% in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price rise was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the rise in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed across the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, said that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
The figures from RP Data show that housing prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rise by an average of five and six percent.
On the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hardly affected by the reductions in government spending and where prices rose by just 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued that with the beginning of the spring now for the next few months there will be a rise in the real estate for sale, which would undergo the market "a real test".
“When we look at the continuously high rates of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the continuously low interest environment, it’s likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he opposes the statements of CEO Peer Medau and attests that he "poses like a field master."
The style of the college is not that, it is said in the statement.
So the family of Medau has already been "middle June orally informed about the university's initiation.
The statement that the plans were announced only in July is definitely wrong,” Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not “predictions or even decisions”, but there will be “preferences”.
Even the extension of the narrow road up to the castle necessary for arrival is less dramatic than the Medus is afraid.
A nine-meter wide road was and is not the talk.
It goes by 5.50 meters according to the current state, which is a meter wider than before,” Pötzl explains.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school parking areas will then be used only by college students in the future, Pötzl will not allow to apply.
Parking is not done at all because it can be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the inhabitants
The children's crippe Bergwichtel, which is on the ground and in front of whose door the arrival will lead to the parking lot along, is intended to be "not damaged" according to the president of the university.
Instead, he gives to consider, “that this is not only about the child’s flu, but also about the inhabitants at the summit to the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring Realschule.
So it’s about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau,” Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parental council of the child’s crypt, with the expansion of the street would be justified by a “the few naturally damaged spots of Coburg” “can the reader decide by himself.”
At the beginning of October, Pötzl will, together with the State Construction Office of Bamberg, inform the city trees about the construction development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new conclusion".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the child’s flu about the college’s plans.
Accordingly, the arrival for the new parking lot will not, as before, lead through the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but through the Medau-Berg.
In this way, the small road should be expanded twice on a length of about a kilometer.
According to the high bills of the Medal, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase by this.
About 2,000 vehicles per day are spoken.
So far, the city did not want to speak about the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt caused health problems for this decision.
I didn’t like the decision, it was over a few months old.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team,” he said on his Facebook page.
He goes with a balance of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany in the international retirement.
Because the wool-powerful back-room player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Bundesstrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With Iceland, who on Tuesday announces his framework for the country games against Switzerland, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me as much as they will thrill my long-term co-player and followers.
But for my club, I want to be healthy available in the coming years, for this, longer regeneration pauses are needed, which the current double burden does not allow.
The left hand man had to fear his career end after a brain infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles' problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone spray that later caused a severe inflammation.
One emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career pass on no body.
I have some health buildings that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations, which took place in a short period of time in 2012, I never properly controlled my blood pressure.
There are a number of other complaints related to this.
“From the beginning of the year, I noticed that I’m controlling my head, but I can’t cheat my body,” Glandorf said in an interview with Handball Time.
For a return he would only be prepared in an absolute emergency.
“When all the strips break, I’m always ready to talk,” the two-time family father told the special magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I’ve also become quite humble with regard to my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least somewhat.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) EHF Cup.
In 2012 he won the European Cup of the Pokal winners with Flensburg.
German economy dropped by 0.2% in spring
The global crisis has slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
GDP declined by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed the preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone lived the economy in the spring, while investments dropped.
Foreign trade also boosted the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual acquisition, the total GDP-plus for the first half of the year is 0.8% compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the city for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmann city of Horstmar experienced a Dutch "fiaters" invasion on Sunday.
The largest bicycle sports association of the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
This is the largest cycling tour around Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked for their registration at Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour through the Münsterland.
Published in various specialized journals, this tour was offered to interested people.
We come from The Hero and have been driving overnight to participate in this tour.
We want to know Munsterland even more in this way,” the cyclists rejoiced the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
Following the registration in the Association of Protecting Brotherhood Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace journey" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
Further, the route, which was written for three different categories, led toward Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Mount toward Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of height, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of height and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of height, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They went to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Major organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor representative Heinz Lölfing expressed their pleasure with the success of this cycling event.
We are happy and it was a great experience for all the participants.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants arrived as the organizer had hoped,which was probably on the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
“We will meet again in 2015 with hopefully good weather on August 30 or during another weekend,” but the cyclists promise to return to Munsterland and the organizers plan a new release.
Constantine Wecker's honest memories
It’s actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantine Wecker, singer, pacifist, political-secure activist, former prisoner, in “Mony and Warrior” has brought to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughtful for thoughtfulness, the Munich, born on 1 June 1947, has recorded his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is very honest: From the onania as a high school student to the stolen and drug consumption, he does not leave human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow people.
The broad space also incorporates abstract but so more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the present, spirituality – all of which he tries to go on the ground, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his Pacificism, his social criticism, his political commitment – and also how not only the music has characterized him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has brought the living man Constantine Wecker also closer to the asketic monk, which is created “through subtraktion,” as he says, “by leaving away all the unnecessary.”
Among all the high-spiritual views, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for instance, over strikes in a GIs frequented room or a wicked car ride, where he visited a tree frontally.
He is also unfairly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said “I love you”
Henry was one of the seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and his relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with vibrant melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
He never saw his face, he only heard his voice: "Listen up with the crack.
Let your sister be quiet.
Moving yourself!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton – who were already adults when I was a child – went with him to the cup and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket shot.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life was he that serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a hostage in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life would have been for him.
It’s now a bit bright, but they’re dark, used, deep stygical labyrinth with flame shots and smoke and a lot of smoke.
My father used to just lay in the bath and then you could slowly hear him singing because he was able to wash the dirt from himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had done it for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without the love confession of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said “I love you.”
Only when my mother went bad at the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you ever stop saying “I love you”?
Stop kissing me.
Dad, I am 22 years old.
The Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he has been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry’s mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You need to be radical.
So I went through this fitnessding and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is anxious.
No one likes to eat potatoes.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cutting bar.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been accepted by theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy work life.
He started at just 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage as he imitated people and wrote on New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. “I was for a fairly long time the only black imitator/comedian on television.”
He learned in the profession.
I had not only to grow up in the eyes of the public, but also to learn from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient joke speaking machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people "make up black," Henry conducted his comedy there for five years.
It was very unpleasant to my family.
I wished somehow that it would never happen, but I do not regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this “year-old award-winning light pillar of British television” was also a “great parody of black people.”
Through the introduction of the characters that both spotted and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentary, TV series, and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, “What do you do as the next, Len, because it all feels like you’re just bringing time around or getting a bit on the place.”
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never learned anything about him right at school, and I thought he was mostly a middle class domain, white in stripes and a coal head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, “You should try it.
Don't do it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so.
Henry made 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt I was able to do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
"It's why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
Soon he came up in the comedy of the mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed yourself.”
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to talk to the audience.
"A small voice told me, 'You have to break over 10 minutes now while they're repairing the computer.'"
Instead, the screenwriter announced that the show will continue as soon as the problem has been solved.
I went out of the stage and something in me said, “Oh, thank God.”
I am not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
“You play in a theatre, so stay in your role.”
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the desires.
It also went well, so it’s like a great shield of the gods who say to me, “This is your destination.”
He says this, of course, with a donated voice.
So I stay there.
I really love that.
I love to be in a test room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is passed by humorous outbreaks, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you’re looking for it, you’re going to a wall.
I sometimes appear live in the Apollo when I want to do it, but in general I don’t get as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey – I don’t think I want to give up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think already.
I like to be an actor.
It is fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis have called for civil dishonesty in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi party "Ansar Allah" said.
The access to the parliament was also blocked.
Yemen's media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for action on Sunday night.
Huthi threatened, according to the newspaper, with a further escalation of the conflict, if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Huthis are struggling for more independence from the Sunni-governed Yemen and call for the government’s resignation.
The Huthi tribe has occupied the capital of Yemen for almost two weeks.
Approximately 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large railway of Sanaa.
There are constantly bloody struggles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registres Officers to Embrace ‘Spirit Employees’
Kenya has begun to register all government officials biometrically to remove “spirit workers” from the government’s salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government assumes that thousands of people still receive salaries even after their farewell from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised at his office in 2013 to fight corruption in public service.
In an examination at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700,000 £) per month of payments for "spiritual employees" and other abusive financial practices were lost.
The government suspects that wages will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their data about the biometric registers is recorded, a government message was.
Anyone who does not do this without a credible apology would be deleted from the salary list, the message continued.
“Through this action will significantly contribute to the rationalization of public service by determining the actual number of officials and also cleansing the salary list on both government levels – thus the “spiritual employees” will be eliminated,” said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the art counselor Helge Achenbach will be negotiated for the first time in court on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, the son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, in a civil proceedings at the Düsseldorfer Landgericht demand 19.4 million euros of damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was by a court spokesman on Monday.
In the complaint it is said that Achenbach has deceived when purchasing artworks and old works, and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than the purchasing prices actually paid.
This also increased the agreed provision.
Achenbach bought goods for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He served in school for 44 years, of which 23 were head of school.
From this time, Manfred Richter knows many Stend Peterhausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his desire to see the people in the student.
The Snow Cup is the most famous mountain in the Giant Hill.
Manfred Richter loves painting with the motivation from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudanese Germans were dismissed.
Within a half hour, the family had to leave their house.
After a few months in a camp it went to Bavaria in 1946.
Thus, the judges went to the Oberfränkische Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the nearest station, the train to Bamberg, there three kilometers around the city to go to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleep opportunity in a Red Cross house in Bamberg: together with up to 15 colleagues in a bedroom.
In 1951, he took the first and in 1954 after three years of teaching, he took the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching place for him, he moved to Oberbayern and arrived at school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he received a three-room service apartment next to the school in the newly built teaching house.
This house was purchased by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were gathered in Petershausen in today's council.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the town.
To escape a retreat in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew up, and so the children and their teachers were able to take on from September 1982 the present building, which was extended in 1997 after Judter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who on municipal costs added a workplace and in the 1997 expansion celler rooms, although this was not granted according to the guidelines for school buildings.
“Mr. Götz was very school-friendly,” the judges recalled thankfully.
Thro his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had answered a reference from a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love."
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” the 84-year-old says today.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always succeed."Whether he only meets his pupils or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, judges' actions were sometimes unconventional.
When the students clinged, they did not receive a punishment from him, and they were not forced to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, the judges had bought two pairs of box gloves and allowed the two counterparts to fight against each other, even if there should be a veil.
For the benefit of the school, the judge as a rector held a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This motivated the unpartial judge after his retirement to nominate in 1996 at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council.
However, the judge was pre-elected to place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicyclists take interim stops in Bad Salzhausen and Scotland
If runners take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scotland, it is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of Rastenden only impressed: the 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour and accompanying tross a break in the lower cur park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Riding and celebrating on newly discovered roads between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the runners took the first stage, which took 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland in attack.
At Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the head of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshing of body and mind, all kinds of good things were prepared: the farmers from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had cooked 85 leaves of apples, sweets, streusel and cheese cakes, which were wonderful for the famous cyclists.
"These cakes can only be baked by farmers," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
At the drink state of the touring group Geiß-Nidda, cold refreshments were produced.
The "Duo Bravo" discussed the visitors with famous melodies from opera and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
A man also a headache from his partner: “He deserved it, finally he fixed back the cycling chains that had already jumped out today.”
Meanwhile, the mayor and the business manager still had to work: they were interviewed by Reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the drinkhouse and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Tobias Hagen, the promotional chief, from the first hr4 round tour in 2004 as the tour leader, was able to get a short break, but he had a lot to do with the technology on the site.
His pick-up print, in which he communicated with his employees through three phones and a radio device and the 15th motorcycle season of Hessen Police, wrote Facebook posts and made reports, also needed a check.
“Most of the participants come from the Rhein-Main region,” he said, “but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants is oriented a bit according to the available accommodation capabilities.
In category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodations.
From the resort, the runners had a good impression when after one and a half hours they stopped again: "Hello!"
“It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!” they screamed for goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to make a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were requested in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park hadined a beautiful festive environment and of course they had prepared flavours, such as flame cakes with well-cooled peanut butter.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as a board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three seemed apparently pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to swim under the open sky was eagerly exploited despite the sporting activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests increasingly mixed citizens, who were engaged by the good mood as much as the big band of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb – including a concert with the Drenkwaldern – were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met back in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "shaking" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey due to suspicion of "breaking against the government", local media agencies report.
Police did not make any immediate comment.
Among the detainees are 14 high-level police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly establishing an organized criminal association and seizing telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described his actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist Fethulla Gull against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
He told reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian folk front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, the head of the school in Slawjansk, who visits the daughter of Jazenjuk, spoke Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing clothed t-shirts, holding ballons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She encounters with a proud crowd from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
He has his own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy company Bain and Co., after which she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons’ media world.
She was the chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the head office of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their discovery was allegedly almost £1 million.
Their political rankings are also strong.
She was recommended by David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, as he sought for more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became the Cabinet Advisor.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
In May, I described the chairman’s task with a poisoned kelch.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.
This creates a unbearable duopoly that demands a complete and comprehensive reform.
But what newly arriving president would be at risk of getting up, striking on everything, and taking off an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might be taking off his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if it wasn’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shortened – power, money and status overwhelmed.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest amount of £145.50 per year, the British public acquires itself into the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pences per day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get newsletters on my phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very loved and remarkable institution.
She needs a significant chairman - I hope she has found him.
Perry from Texas says the tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a decaying comment on the Democratic District Prosecutor who is at the heart of a criminal accusation against him for abuse of official power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry user account that abstracted the previous one.
Just a tweet was sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't bill the tweet and I deleted it," it said in the later message.
Perry’s staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although Perry’s tweets went out of the official user account, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the previous tweet a disadvantaged picture of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced in April 2013 for drunk on the drive.
Perry filed a veto against a financial support from her office when she refused to withdraw, leading to an accusation against Perry - who could be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The tweet says: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but if I do it, I complain to Governor Perry if he explains it."
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the leadership of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state lawyer from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry claims not guilty and called the accusation a political trick.
His high-quality team of law enforcement officers asked the court in the case to reject the charges and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of Texas is unconstitutionally diffus.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and investigates cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to withdraw.
This veto resulted in a public complaint from a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perry’s official user account is often updated – and sometimes famous.
After he finished as the fifth at the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went into speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while running near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley says housing market is “normal”
One of the most prominent construction entrepreneurs in London pointed out that the housing market in Southeast England has returned to the normal level.
Property houses in the capital were hotly sought and subject to enormous price rises, which driven the Bank of England to set top limits for mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit blast.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-quality construction company Berkeley said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its highest level in 2013,” adding that this offers a “stable environment of action.”
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the decline as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Catastrophe Office, prices in the city area alone last year have risen sharply by 18.5 percent, much more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices for Berkeley’s private, affordable and student offers increased by about a fifth in the past year and were around £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been scared by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "ville taxes" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, in which stricter credit agreements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise of real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, on the basis of a already weakening home price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now decreased by a quarter year by year, the broker WA Ellis said.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts for deadline sales rise to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the deadline sales remained stable.”
In June, the company that it had sold 3,742 new houses in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
The annual tax outcome increased by 40 percent annually to £280 million, the turnover by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the income for Berkeley in the current year is expected to meet the current market expectations.
Analysts accordingly estimate the annual pre-tax outcome to £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood fixed at £23.96 in London trade in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar award.
Naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker claiming to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and complained the hacker for "extraordinary violation of privacy".
The authorities have been informed and will track all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly acquired by a gap in Apple's online iCloud storage system. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It’s not sure how many of the images are real, although Winstead, star from “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“To those of you who look at the photos that my husband and I took in the private environment of our house years ago, I hope you are so happy with you,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickelode concerts "iCarly" and "Victorious" argue that the photos are about images of her and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are GEFALTH, people.
Let’s go to the beginning. *Wordplay intended.
Buzzfeed late Sunday that a spokesman for the pop star Ariana Grande abstracted the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive output from Howard Jacobson's highly promised new novel about love and the letters "J".
They broke down, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a carton that you have left standing in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him he was too serious, anxious, intense, distant, and a little crazy.
Then he shed his hand.
He knew shortly.
He was stumbling like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this disgrace was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boring of his life than any other, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremendously narrow beauty with untouched hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older accompanying who kept Kevern for her grandmother, and who had inherited a land in a wet but paradise valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one lived in the house.
The tubes were leck, in the baths were still spines, the nuts had left their traces on all the windows and believed that all of this belonged to them, and the garden was overwhelmed with insecticide that looked like enormous coal heads.
It was like the house of a child mark, both threatening and attractive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had with Ailinn handheldly sitting on the broken league chairs in the high grass and enjoying an unusual warm spring afternoon. Both had mentally absently swallowed into the service console, which provided the country with calming music and tremendous news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had pleased to laugh at closed roles in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
No prohibited - nothing was so correctly prohibited - simply not played.
It was successfully obsolete, as the word obsolete.
The general taste produced what let and regulations would never have succeeded, and as people in books choose from-teller washer to-millionaire memories, cookbooks and love novels, they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and in a grob-comic Ailinn's great feet.
Ailinn didn’t understand that.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically placed two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a fun game at the time, and it was not a fun game at the time.
He knew that this was expected from him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly prohibited.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
It was just a place for one “when” in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
The mind as well.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was a musical sense.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the half-secret collection of his father's old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
In her age she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A consistent society meant that every element of this society thankfully agreed to the principle of group membership – thankfully as those saved from fate.
People of African-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and run.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by electronic talents as by nature and were cared for the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the canalization; what was left of the Greeks broke the plate.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT HAS HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE
Everyone according to his skills.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just provided to her could ever be removed.
Music was an expression of love.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the fraudulent sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the noise of the enormous collary leaves.
Ailinn did not understand.
Why should your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips again in her presence.
She thought he was something strange.
“It seemed funny to him,” he said instead.
She scratched her head unbelievably and locked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see around the world than her untouched black hair.
There was nothing he would have wanted to see otherwise.
“If you say it,” I mean without conviction.
But that doesn’t explain why you predict it to me.
He seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so straightforward.
Maybe your butter, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my knots are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I do not hate you.
This is just the stupid song.
He could have said “I love you,” but it was too early to do it.
“Your thick knots are exactly the reason you like me,” he tried instead.
I am a bit perverse.
It didn’t sound right.
It had to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often brought himself into difficulties because he, like his father, did not have the calming charm that was needed to remove the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Per his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Solomon's Ailinn became red and rose out of her bed chair, throwed the console and dropped the wine they had drunk.
Holunder blood wine, so drunkeness was not an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to be trembling like palm water in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel perverse attracted to you," she said ...
Except that I am not that.
She regretted him, both for the unnecessary unpleasantity of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rejected against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more frightened after what was seen as their ancestors were as scammers and beach robbery, moved from clay to clay, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who denied or laughed against them.
The Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick face if she didn’t care.
They first knock - knock was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter to the unspoken love ballads from the console - they first knock and then knock.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the knitting itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt blurred, but the wheat of her sadness surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She looked at him as he went away—as his companion looked at him from a room in the upper floor—a man complaining about something he had sworn up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, turning his back, shameful, defeated, without a fighting spirit—why was that a view that she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen something like that before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon on her feet.
A few years before the recent events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public mood, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at low and medium levels in exactly the parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, would be most likely to be expected, given the funds and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"There has been a lot done, and a lot has to be done," she wrote, "to strengthen the inherent aggression of a people who led a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness historically seen was rarely felt despite the high demands of church towers between the hills.
But some characteristics appear to be irreversible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to raise.
The population cries when hears sentimental ballads, breaks out to stories about overcome difficulties and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former poverty keeps the rural communities as well as our urban artifacts firmly in hand, but there are also evidence of the emergence of a new and overwhelming controversy at home, at work, on the streets and even on the fields of play.
"They have an unhappy tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I suggest that you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
“I think I don’t have to say that,” Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme applied to her right to privacy and rejection of the statement.
the feminist?
Silence again.
“I don’t ask that,” Luther Rabinowitz said, “because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is an unprecedented workplace.
We serve an unprecedented society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in itself are absolutely acceptable and praiseful, can occasionally distort the results as you’ve presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things you call “backward” and “righteous” could be interpreted by others as well as as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to move around what is happening, when it is happening, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED script in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.
Smile to your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, hear, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the songed word is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out," Esme Nussbaum answered with a quiet voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet healed as effectively as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that without warning we may find ourselves in how we repeat the errors that lead to what is done when it is done.
But this time it is not the others to whom we leave our anger and our uncertainty.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To give an angel patience.
“They’re going too far,” he said, “when you call actions ‘feil’ that our grandparents may or may not have done.
They’re going too far when you’re talking about the fact that they’ve left out their “wrath” and their “disconfidence” in “other”.
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we are not talking about "we" and "other".
There was no “we” and there was no “other”.
It was a time of disorder, that’s all we know.
“From that, if we are honest with ourselves,” Esme dare to say, “no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not complain to anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no more to be said about this, we agree.
And just as no guilt must be attributed, no guilt must be attributed if such a dismissal is appropriate and if there is a way to dismiss it.
But what is the past, if we don’t learn from it?
The past serves us to forget it.
If I can say something about it -
Luther Rabinowitz put his pyramids down.
“I’m going to consider her report,” he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was passed by a motorcycle driver who, as passants described, had been driving on the road in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no strike is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued to have planned a state strike to collapse the government and said they argued against police officers accused of weaping political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and that the army of the country has surrounded its residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after he had threats of murder.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto state strike, but that the military would react to the threat by "political fanatics" whose arms were predicted by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the Lesotho defense forces acted after he received several intelligence reports that within the police some elements acted who actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who stood near to cause devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action made the impression of a breakthrough.
“Even if no one has claimed to have robbed the government by violence, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho’s defence forces so far show signs of a state strike,” he said.
A spokesman for the Lesotho military said on Sunday that the soldiers would return to their casinos and the situation in the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the leadership during Thaban's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become the target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the disputes in his unity government.
He said his actions would not undermine the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the Eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of the Producing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, following a level of 51.8 in July.
A figure above 50 indicates an expansion.
New contracts went back and factories experienced intrusions in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will be set before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the bank to have a clear plan to deal with the delayed recovery of the euro area and the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further details during this week whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the Eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Al a small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty have become more evident for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economy of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer calming,” Mr. Dobson said.
The decline in the industry is likely to burn the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economic Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say about the purchase manager index of the producing industry in the Eurozone from August is that after that the sector continues to grow.”
He added: “Producers in the Eurozone find life obviously quite difficult now, as the current increased geopolitical tensions – especially with regards to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainty have clearly affected the economy – in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and likely lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it will be "all more likely" that the ECB will eventually have to launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The heavenly decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible collapse of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken as hostages by the Czech militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned after Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped to death at the grief in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible collapse of the school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, disappeared, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed to be the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East into disappointment, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped to death at the grief in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now cheating Ukraine – and in which children like them die – is now ending.
The girl who was photographed in an attempt to jump back into the broken school sport hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she just tried in her underwear to jump back to the broken school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were found dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me I had to run around my life, but I couldn’t,” said Aida.
My legs were overflowed blood.
I stood up and climbed in again to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her safe.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid I will have to be operated again.
Some granates are still in my knees.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says struggling.
“This has happened to me, and you can’t change it.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who remained there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the load will always remain a part of her, although the memory becomes slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself on the internet as I go back to school, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and contribute to the fact that something like this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball hole believes his mother is dead.
It was his first school day (Russia went to school at 7 years of age) and survived the three-day storage in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mama told me I should sit down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion he thought he would die.
She said to him, “Go.”
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying little boy on the way, took it in his hand and fled through a ball hole.
His father Vladimir, who held his son out in the arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara was thrown out and with leg injury in the hospital, on her side, assuming that her son was killed.
After her reunification, she said, “I cried for joy.
I couldn’t believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to get the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will blush in my memory.
I still know that immediately after that I throw away all my toy pistols.
But now I can play computer games with shoot scenes and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those children with whom I played in the yard and who didn’t get out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially at the gambling stores where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a top open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer under the grief," said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I would like to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and I hope they take me to the school next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the deployment, there were simply no children who could scream and run around, and that silence lasted many months.
She lively remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and simply tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir loved to eat Borschtch and called them to all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with cells in a restaurant. Damir shot with his water pistol on them and they ran away and played with him.
It was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, “I always think this world has not been better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
These are children like ours.
I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they’re tired or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
I can’t stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that’s so sad.
Damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not seeking revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past greed.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and burn candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered down - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, the face turned away from us, for hours.
He was not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I still remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys.Damir is now 17, bigger than me, well-known, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible.
“I remember that I told him, ‘Damir, run, run away,’ but I was so sure that he didn’t hear me.
But he heard it and he went away.
And this is how life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgi Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image after the deployment became the symbol of the greed of Beslan
Trost: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was scattered by fear when he ran around his life, while Czech terrorists shoot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, a 54-year-old physician, had put him off for his first school day before she was hurrying to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
“I left the courtyard about two minutes before the terrorists hit him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone,” she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only Georgie managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no one day we don’t remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time ago, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days follow me forever.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was devoted as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day. he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgy in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden in the bookroom at home with us.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world, thanks to this image, feel our pain.
Georgij says today: “It’s important that such a thing can never happen again.
“I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People are investigating such tragedies again and again and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something horrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because when you ask the people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are nothing with such pain.
It takes dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had a few nightmares due to the load, but then it became better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I always go to the sport hall when the 1st of September comes closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel as a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I will not complain.
My life continues.
I have completed the school this year and I attend a medical college in Wladikawkaz.
I will be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
by Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived despite being caught at the feet of a murderer terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, but he managed to survive.
During the deployment, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was fixed at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is a wonder that he was not killed.
“We feel like it was yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret agent, but was unable to do this due to his health damage due to the bullying.
It’s still with me, it’s nothing I’ve left behind.
I'm now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not right.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and then I really felt a little better, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year afterwards - was the first and only time I went back to the sport hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after loading on the laptop
My pain is immense and I wear it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically I am well.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can now run well.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about it, and they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary is coming closer.
I will go to the celebrations to remember.
I know that Georgia will not go.
It must be much more violent for him because he was there and I didn’t.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. here in Beslan all are drawn of it.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept it when something is so unfair.
He’s a boy, he likes sports, but he can’t participate because of his knees.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but does not exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the relocation and this only aggravates my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My Son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart is crying about the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of wives who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want it.
I will never forget how my heart ran in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people struggling for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If we could only attack and throw out all of these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so captivatingly carried in safety by a special operation command
Rescue: Aljona Tskajewa is saved by a Russian Special Operation Command (links).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the armor of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, their 10-year-old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar back in the school sport hall.
Makhar, then three-year-old, escaped, but Alion's mother and sister died in the murder.
Her father Ruslan has since married again and has with his new wife Swetlana a little girl he has called after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, doesn’t remember the burden and has grown up to a smart and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that take up with the 10th anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused girls of passing a pedestrian transition in Fife
A 78-year-old man stands in court for the transit of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian pass in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of attacking a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The accusation says Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and wounded the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, opposes the charges before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set the procedure for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a water-resistant point-and-shot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both are to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price below $350.
Regardless of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery box and other tanks are closely locked.
Also put your camera on the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorder have scenic and recording modes that optimize exposure time for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cameras usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see it under water, and the right image setting is a good thing.
So make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that makes a series of captures with lightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will become dramatically worse, the further you get away from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when you take records in a swimming pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice for land, but it is so important under water due to the bad light conditions.
It is important when you work with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects when they are intended to fill out the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As anesthetic consultant, he dedicated his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the illness of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnoses and diseases are important to doctors, while the people who were treated are mostly engaged in something completely different: pain.
However, one day in 2007 he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty getting up.
While he fought with the influenza-like symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.
“I prefer everything immediately than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and unreasonable.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to make a X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was presented.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an unhealing cancer that attacks the chest, i.e. the skin that transcends the lungs.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is often difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have previously been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber-building material, which once was considered a "wonder" but now has been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, as the industry voluntarily committed to not using it anymore.
Even where it was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - climbers, construction workers, room workers and wire workers for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from a different time it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But that self-satisfaction is unreasonable.
The UK seems to be experiencing today the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of Mesothelium deaths since 1980 and predictable future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos have been illegal for years (all types of asbestos have been banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the castle of the Mesothelium is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we study, and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore, Mesotheliom does not know class disabilities, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shops in London to private schools, are no protective room.
The parliamentary buildings are asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are going to be healthier, this deadly carcinogen has already been drawn out as the outskirts.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a speaker.
It was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
“It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I completed my training for six years,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and pfortners - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my elderly people will suffer from the same disease?
He was able to answer this question at least partially.
“From the four doctors who have been trained at Guy’s Hospital and who have been sick of mesothelioma over the past five years,” he wrote in a letter in 2010, “I am the last who is still alive.”
How many of us will be sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It was an unusual long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still be sick?”
The leading UK expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic is expected to survive in the UK, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be a victim.
Most of them do not know that they are going to die like this.

A short look at the documents of the courts, to which the affected persons often appeal for compensation claims, shows how far the mesothelium’s gates are already spread.
For example, in June this year, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had negligently exposed asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twentieth.
“From this thing,” she says, “I’ve never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn’t even really know anything about asbestos.
I would never have thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The term asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake plates in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with potential deaths.
More dangerous, however, are the brown asbestos (Amosite) and the blue asbestos (Crocydolith).
The UK was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “this gives clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high mesotheliomate.”

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto’s work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
He has submitted a study of the affected, showing that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomes without known interruption was likely caused by contact with asbestos in the environment."
Most of these contacts, according to his statement, are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has investigated the palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, could have been unconsciously exposed to the matter.
In 2009, Goddard that the services and pipeline behind the parliament’s committees were filled with asbestos, whose deadly fiber could be filled with something as harmless as “strong air movements”.
Parliamentarians are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like they do the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Work Service insisted that the Westminster Palace has received a "clean health certificate", it is now unquestionable that £1 billion of work will need to be spent over several years to renovate the parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, the MPs will probably be more likely to meet in the nearby QE2 conference center than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that “the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions.”
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
Everything you can do is wait.
One person who could never exactly determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
As Andrew Lawson suspects the 50-year-old Abbott that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positive," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It’s so difficult to remember all the places you’ve worked on, and the data.
What he still remembers exactly is the day in early December 2009, when he got such a type of fever.
He was 45 years old and was undergoing an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I was cold.
It came suddenly.
I felt horrible.
I thought I could not make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain flowed from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Injured doctors made X-rays of his chest and used pleurakathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after sports exercise and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbot's condition worsened again and his home doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to a team of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped sonde was introduced into the cavity between the ribbon and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually go on,” he says.
To be honest, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was presented in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, one of which recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where tubes were often isolated with asbestos,” he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now encounters younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canyons (as Graham Abbott often did), were more likely to get in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals could be life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the physicians who were treating.
He is still being removed today.
Students put their burns on asbestos.
It is not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been frequently used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous isolating and flamming properties.
and schools as well.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have placed their burns on asbestos.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently discussed on websites.
And therefore, such innocent objects in our houses such as floor plates or shoppings standardly contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial gift that is included in large parts of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact one affected woman was the collapse of a garden cat in the 1970s.
So take care of how you cut your garden spots.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process it,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I couldn’t focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
I’m not going to see another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to deal with.
“It was very difficult to accept it all,” he says.
I asked my doctor, “How long am I still?”
I was given about 12 months.
I remember I thought, “Well, I’m not going to experience another Christmas party.
That was then.”
Mesothelioma is foolish because it is our life-saving mechanism – the breath itself – that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos are made of the smallest fiber.
When the asbestos is swallowed and the fiber is inhaled, they can fix themselves in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fiber irritates the chest and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises with the inhaled nadle-shaped asbestos,” says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, from which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos, is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pressed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancer diseases do not work so well with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial.
Some think it is worth an attempt.
Treasure denies that.
“You can’t cut off the chest,” he says.
They don’t come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, cancer "not speaks very well on chemotherapy," which shows "effect", but does not heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a single-man support and consultancy office for fellow affected.
“Hello, Cancer Center,” he expressed himself joyfully when he called.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years ago and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott was offered six chemotherapy cycles, which will take four months and are expected to extend his life by just one month.
“I was desperate,” he said.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed “to make things appear in a slightly more positive light.”
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, Heart-Thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had a advantage that I didn't have to be sent, I just called and got a date," Graham acknowledges.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail inevitably, many affected persons are concerned with another financial concern - about the future of the families that leave them.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos are extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realized that even a very small burden was a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually submitted their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "complete compensation" as Lawson couldn't with absolute certainty prove that his mesothelioma was caused by an asbestos contact on the Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos in the affected cell area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation to attribute the fatal asbestos contact to a company or workplace - usually decades after the accidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but not with the prosecutors.
As a response, this year there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for mesotheliom-related people to apply for compensation even if their former employers are no longer to find.
The law has set up a fund sponsored by the insurance industry of £350 million for everyone who was diagnosed after July 2012 can prove a contact, but cannot prosecute anyone.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have promised them in a normal damages proceedings - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications in the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many Mesotheliom affected, that £350 million represented a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
“This is a deal of insurers for insurers,” he says, indicating that this amount is about a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time hadn’t passed over and mesotheliom patients could find the companies and normally prosecute them.
Mike Penning, then employment and pension minister, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan acknowledged that in the face of seven deaths daily, a quick action was necessary.
“People suffer so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelium Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, from which he expected a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-night therapy, with which Long-Lazdunski can present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strong.
“This is of course with the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is always seen in patients.
There is something that allows you to continue.
If you give up, you get worse quickly.
Graham Abbott was undergoing the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Surveillance scans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I was just 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is lifelong.
Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumor is more visible.
But the process is physically and psychically very challenging.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I’m not anymore, for example, or show my wife how the boiler site setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I’t get older.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very friendly and untouched.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more resistant.
She didn’t say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to pass through.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not passed by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould) a terrible safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China rejects Hong Kong's right to government election, protesters swear reward
On Sunday, China’s parliament, despite the increasing calls for democratic reforms, decided against the Hong Kong voter’s nomination of candidates for the 2017 election.
This action is likely to blame the long announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization into the way within a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the People's Congress in principle allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-Peking candidates.
"It doesn't come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said law expert Emily Lau, the chairman of the Democratic Party.
That’s not what Beijing has promised.
The people of Hong Kong are lying.
And it is clear that we have to do with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said the admission of public nominations in the Hong Kong government elections would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK has returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants vote for the presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the course firmly in hand by a Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates will be allowed "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-effective protests in Hong Kong have been held in several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong stands the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to cut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general voting right.
On Sunday night, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said their movement has reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide detailed information about this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that is intended to take place only when all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the possibilities of dialogue have been exploited and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and on Sunday, security measures were strengthened in front of the government building, including police and barricades.
The unrest is increased by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The expulsion of people from the continent increases the competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, will begin to break under Beijing’s increasing pressure.
Some criticized the Occupy-Central movement’s demonstrations as it threatened the business – the life of Hong Kong.
“The protests they talk about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they will last,” said law expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to be afraid that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China’s state-controlled media also recently the Democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region’s history.
The tradition of school graduate balls in the U.S. is now transferred to the universities where freshmen performances are offered with the private aircraft.
We look forward to being able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK’s first luxury travel service for today’s students.
To a impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said that the service has a security part.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cut their hability in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that this year students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A corporate spokesman said no new reservations were presented since the service was just introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also that despite the £9,000 scholarship fees per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of NUS for Higher Education said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of most students.
Many students who start studying this month find themselves exposed to a crisis of living costs as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep the steadily rising bills for the easiest life bases before they can think at all of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as the arrival in the student residence.
Feminist women criticize racial issues and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands into the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, for the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put gender in front of the race when it comes to disputing reproductive law and income equality.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shoots of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts on Ferguson by a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez this meant a significant change.
"I don't think that there's a lot of people in feminism who talk about being white and privileges in such a high-quality way," she said.
People felt pushed to express something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought the light of problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but that are not considered as "women's topics" in the cultural space.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people in their own country are under burden, the silence is ear poisoning.
“How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to clearly separate themes; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now link the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were silent, and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point when white women fighters for women’s right to vote, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote could be successful for only one group: women or black.
“They met the decision to advocate women’s right to vote, and the right to vote for black people should come later,” Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you will be able to realize why colorful women don’t trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women obtained the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade until white women organised themselves against Lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists "fangen" with the problems with which black women have been confronted for generations.
“Will it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to reception control?” asked Mitchell.
Feminist women of the second generation, who build up their career on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian's columnist, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the topic of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a body-owned danger - and opinions about the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on the racial topic in America are surprising.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "very more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments about Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
Police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that pushes itself in the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police attacked 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform comes back to the surface – this time as a women’s topic.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that in order to rearrange the topic as an essential women’s topic, they should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
“These speak for themselves,” said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a posthole in women’s organizations,” she said.
"Swine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate brokers as it became clear that it showed a big pig that it had made it comfortable in the living room.
The free house has a bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pig who had swallowed his head on a sofa.
Property broker Connells said the pig on the photo is the owner's pet.
"But the photo was wrongly published and was now removed," said a spokesman for the company.
In the exposition of the house, Connells described the previous assembly house as a "unicity single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sale caused interest in social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW City Harvey hosts a new millionaire after lottery win
A lottery player from Harvey is coming this month.
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving $1.1 million from the lottery education on Saturday.
A newspaper skiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The winner must still be notified.
The store owner Steve Forward said the profit provides conversation material in the small town in southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could come.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a decent conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaries in August after a couple from Belmont had achieved a megawinning of $7.5 million just a few weeks ago.
The winner pair had been playing for twenty years and said the win would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey Millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of $85 million.
Leonidas asks for the Gladiatorenarena
Not only the gladiators stood knokeltively in the match at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the recreational park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who resisted the rain and the autumn cold and let themselves be thrilled by the historic spectacle.
There was a colourful range of performances, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhine.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust fighting art in the soft sanded arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and skillful presentator and sent his men in the ring to the heroic two-walk in various gladiator gangs.
First, the "provocators" were on the line with the right back and short sword as well as the legs on the left leg and the arms on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with the brust shell, short sword and wreck, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who played against the "Secutor" with a wire, a triangle and a dolch, and after a short struggle hit the bourgeois to the ground.
Then the swords strike metal together, the shield created, and the worms flown surrender through the arena that could become a fear and fear about the health of the gladiators.
But on which the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular judge, had a always attentive eye.
“We wanted to resume the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experienced,” explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer “Friendskreis Römerkanal”, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation time, a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, was made out of the recreational park for a day, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The remains of it were also to be admired during the Roman Day, such as "Aquaduct-Marmor" from the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Canal Bridge, which then stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society faced the water and energy supply once and now, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: “We still benefit today from the knowledge of that time.”
This is also confirmed by Diploma Measurement Engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "EngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented the Measurement Instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations of the year 1894, as well as stones from the original Hypokaust, the hot air heating that once heated the Römervilla.
It is also impressive the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs in the footprints two thousand years ago before they burned them.
In 2011, the Bodendenkmalpflege Office at the Landesverband Rheinland had grabbed the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord Commercial Park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building have been found with a threshold to dry grains and melt.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of findings from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, as well as parts of a curved neck chain.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the German invasion of the Roman Rhine, Morscheiser suspects.
In her, the children also engaged in the Roman wind wheat game, similar to today’s wheat game, or they, like the Roman students, wrote their names with metal grapes on grocery tables.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich the children were allowed to put mosaics themselves, at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach glassmosaics and at the stand of the natural center of Eifel Nettersheim a heavy wheat mole of stone to make the mole for a flat bread or a mole.
With the original faithfully renovated Roman travel car drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors travelled through the recreational park and also passed the impressive state of the City High School, which presented the results of their “Roman Project Week”.
With a Romanian week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter the Romanian Year 2014, which is called to remind the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the partnership association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic excursions, a lecture, a cooking evening and guides for school classes are offered to remind the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told about his work on the adjacent Wachtberg, presented plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and offered a funny lesson on the understanding of the people between a group of Wachtberg "German" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Römerthema within a project week.
With the Romanian Week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg will be re-experienced.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus a small presentation will remind the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: Epidemic Strengths West African Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are overwhelmed - and international companies go on a distance.
The Ebola epidemic is a serious blow to the West African economy.
The harvest is rooted on the fields, the mines are left and the markets are wasted - the virus has hardly added to the region.
Some international companies are already on a distance.
“Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis, but also an economic crisis,” says African Development Bank chief Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the most affected.
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sell clothes on the second-largest market in Liberia’s capital Monrovia.
On the market only comes those who want to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola.
Liberia is the most affected by the virus, alone here more than 600 people were killed by the fever.
Recently, the health authorities stated that the disease has been spread in every corner of the country.
The virus has spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have died, and thousands of others have joined.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
In the rich countries, companies operate.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Also the local merchants and farmers react: A few merchants are still leaving their home to get back.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under the quarantine, the imports of cacao and coffee beans were destroyed on the fields.
Farmers don’t dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food becomes short
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert in the West African economy.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefer to stay at home.
Therefore, the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes short.
In the markets, the stock of basic foods such as rice decreases.
At the same time, the region, which is highly dependent on international companies, is threatened with image damage - with widespread consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will fundamentally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon from the French Think Tank Iris.
It is important to know how far and how long the virus will spread.
“Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest,” Hugon warns.
The disease also burns the strapassed state budgets of the states.
The disease also affects the state households of the affected countries.
The rating agency Moody's fears that its budgets will be strongly strapped by the high spending on the healthcare system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to provide the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million ($45 million).
The effects are noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
However, many people remain at home because of the fear of an infection.
Reservations in hotels also decline significantly.
Defenders Celebrate their 50th Anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Tannenwald Schützenverein the preparations for the 50th foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening is planned with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday at 18 a.m. the big shooting.
Then, in the big tent, the atmospheric evening is with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of music
The highlights on Sunday are the festive divine service and at 9:30 in the parish church and the great festival at 14:00.
In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of the Federal and Gauschießens.
A beautiful view will be the 25 Festdames with their dirndln.
The festival is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The government was held by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from the year 1907, when on 21 March the association was founded for "social entertainment through exercise in room shooting and small-caliber shooting".
The NS regime in 1937 caused the dissolution of the association.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on April 30 in the Lukas hostel lifted the "new" protective group "Tannenwald" Berngau out of the baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as protector master through a difficult start-up period, in which it was mainly about finding a association room and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started the round fighting in the hostel "Leininger" with two teams.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized in seven teams, established in all classes until the 1st Gauliga.
The association records broke annually and the magical border of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance capacity of the active defenders has increased, the membership numbers have also evolved positively.
Since the Leininger Association Hall has no longer met the demands of a modern protective association, the then board, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, has decided to create a future home in the celler rooms of the new Landgasthof Härteis.
After a work of 2,700 hours, on 8 May 1988, Pope Strasser gave the church blessing for the new protective rooms.
One of the great peak points in the association history was the 44th Gauschießen, associated with the celebration of the new protective flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a bull group was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and the association as a whole was the direction of the 2005 Bayerische Böllertreff.
In many hours of voluntary work, the association members modernized the rooms and shooting facilities in Berngauer Hof last year, bringing them to the latest state of technology.
11 teams in round fighting
You can also see the sports performance of the protective team.
In total, 11 teams are currently participating in the round of battle: six Air Force teams, one Air Pistol team, one Sport Pistol KK1, one Youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the ANB Schützengau) to the District League 1.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as bowling, fashing and royal football, club excursions and Christmas celebrations have tradition.
The guards also participate in the festivals in Pfarrei and the municipality.
Tony Stewart has suffered an accident when he returns to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway by his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart ran against the wall for the second time, after his right front tires placed in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-person team is disappointed, but he is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish we had a better performance and a better result for him,” Johnston said.
We go to Richmond and hope we can do it better there.
Stewart was driving earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to make the right side of his car repair.
“I’ve entered today with quite good hopes for a good result,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work.”
Not long after the second accident, Stewart’s car was charged into the slopes and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at a ash racing in northern New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace while an investigation of the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was investigated.
The authorities said on Friday that investigations on the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart has to count on an accusation.
The three-time champion was received with great pleasure when he was presented before the race.
After a start to the 12th place, Stewart was soon afterwards advanced into the first 10 and was temporarily on the 4th place.
After a re-start in round 122, Buschs
Vehicles with the No. 18 out of control after the output from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.

NATO will not break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned stages in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the establishment agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The head of NATO, however, accused Russia of “a cruel breakdown” of the agreement.
“Today we have to see the reality that Russia does not see NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show that “they see us as opponents.”
Strengthening NATO Presence

Merkel spoke power word: Maut will come “fullly clear”
The chancellor is confessing it again.
But a free letter for all complicated details is not.
Strong concerns from the CDU against the truck property have seen the CSU rising.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a truck mouth after continuing opposition from her CDU.
"To say it quite clearly, she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come," the party chief said on Monday after the meetings of the CDU top agencies in Berlin.
However, a detailed model Merkel has not yet made it clear.
In the black-red government program are called "specific parameters".
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and on it is now continuing to work."
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no to an equal power on all streets.
Merkel stressed that the finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the consultations for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, such as broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report uncommended on Sunday, his house examines his own concept to pay off highway investors with mouth income - after the election of 2017.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned of developing mouth concepts against the federal prime minister in the cabinet.
CDU deputy Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
“The coalition agreement never went out of shrinking all circular and federal roads,” the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU country chairman said.
In this regard, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk about the topic again.
Resistance to the plans comes also from the CDU-land associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is the fears that a mouth will affect the small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty from the CDU because of the violent criticism.
The left viewed the plans as failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
“The Murks mouth is dead,” party chief Bernd Riexinger told New Osnabrücker Zeitung (Mondag).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignet obligation on all German roads, which is scheduled to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged extra according to the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the mortgage through the car tax.
However, according to EU law, the model cannot disadvantage foreign drivers due to their nationality.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of an error diagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and backbone.
Charity CMT UK that misdiagnosis are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe walking, and crumbled legs.
The disease is unhealthy and progressive, which means the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she suffered from Friedreich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who today is 51 years old, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell down constantly and everything lasted with me longer.
I could never ride wheelchair or skateboard with the other children and was often hunted at school because of my way of walking and walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 she saw her medical documents after several operations to discharge her Achilles and stretch her legs when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious so I told no one, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society," she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and terribly panic.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and between that and that I would slowly lose all my skills.
I made it all alone and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she became clear that her abilities had not dropped as strongly as she had imagined and consulted her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair now."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
“When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to pay attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a.D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworks officer since the closure of the former military exercise site.
For almost a decade, there has been no more shootings on the former military training site in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, a deadly ammunition occurs every month in the heart of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be broken on the site.
A ear-smoking knall halls during the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shooting fell on the Munsingen Army Exercise Square, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500 hectare area is the core part of the biospheric area of Schwäbische Alb, which is open on 13 clear roads for pedestrians and cyclists.
Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington District rises with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country grew slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to $3.9 percent last year, and it was the third year of growth in a row after several years of decrease in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose stronger than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax income, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s income comes from companies.
Virginia has the lowest tax income from companies with 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery of the real estate values of companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the course appears to be appropriate for the space of Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion on state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase over a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery of real estate values is not so effective in increasing state and local tax revenues in Maryland, as real estate taxes reach almost one-fifth of the corporate tax settlement.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following happens: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to offer the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery of corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the recovery of the real estate market.
The company’s revenue also seems to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region income tax on state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rise equally in all three locations.
The rise rate in the district was 4.3 percent to the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia a lower average tax increase of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income tax with 6 percent in all three offices (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local corporate taxes are required and a better tax climate is generally governed than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not examined.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, the small in the Washington area seem to go better, and therefore they pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure according to which most small enterprises are organized - in District, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes in total.
The researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in general multi-tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could fall behind if the federal government’s expenditure reduction affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hopping and malz - also a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China is now looking for a brewery and also hopes for a flight-direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, brown in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - so is the urgent desire of officials in China.
“We would be very pleased if a German brewery settled in our city,” said Deputy Party Secretary of the South China Metropolitan, Li Yiwei, this week during a visit to a SPD delegation in his city.
The official of the ruling Communist Party of China repeatedly came back during the conversation on this concern of the twelve-million-metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as the canton in Germany, is one of China’s richest cities, warb Li.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessic SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he will consult in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
“For beer it doesn’t need much: good water, grains and life joy,” he added at lunch with the party over in Guangzhou.
This joy of life is already radiated by Mr. Li, he smiled the host.
After that, the official from Guangzhou met with shepherds, but with red wine served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao returns to German craft.
Tsingtao beers are brewed according to the German order of purity.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight-direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Chief of the Party Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but canceled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be worth it again,” the municipal politician showed himself convinced.
“The trade between our two cities is increasing.”
Currently, travellers should take the route through Changsha in the Hunan province, Li complained.
Also the administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, hopes on the airline connection.
The province’s deputy governor, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - the Chinese Vice-Ministry Li Jinjun, an intimate acquaintance with Germany, agreed.
Maintained Partnership
Guangzhou’s humble deputy chairman hopes he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already in the main, but not in this position yet.
He came to office only this year after his predecessor had been deported from office for corruption charges.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is hardly pursued by Prime Minister Xi Jinping.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is extremely unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Prior to his office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the VW car manufacturer built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially signed more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers away Guangzhou belongs to those that areined by both sides, for example by a student exchange.
Last year we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese union.
The South China metropolitan on the Perl Stream is, with its economic strength, almost as strong as the whole of Hessen.
In the next year, it intends to reach a GDP of €250 billion, Li.
Joan Rivers's family "presses the fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she has been delivered to a hospital in New York City three days ago; however, her daughter showed herself hopefully today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her disease.
“Thank you for your lasting love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We all press the fingers.
Her mother was delivered to the Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to a heart attack in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "sickness".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly dust smokers and increasing wages
For cars and dust smokers that come into commerce from today, more stringent environmental standards will be applied in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new dust washers will receive from 1 September a label on which the buyer can look at central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, stronger nitrogen oxide values are applied in the Euro 6 pollutant class.
In addition, there is more money for the equipment builders: they receive a federal single minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.4 billion
Amazon just confirmed what information had on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a acquisition of Twitch, but because it was largely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it seemed as if the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was decided for a cool billion thing, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their brave pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "Let's Play", a video game in which better-knowers give the (most older) games a thrill of secret science theaters, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was somewhat tired, an example of a established technology company that purchases a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come into effect, as the company was according to reports ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it is this statement by Emmet Shear, chairman of Twitch: "We chose for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who explain that they prefer to drive sports than to watch, it’s hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others while playing rather than taking the control console into their hands.
It’s one thing to look at a friend over the shoulder at 3 a.m. while she’s sliding through Resident Evil, and something quite different to see a spinner as he’s shot 20 times in the head in Call of Duty.
You can watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so looking without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I acknowledge that the fast passes in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete all the games in record time are fun.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuality, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
What do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have easily swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to have: thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of gaming," and the media shows no signs of a shrinking, nor even - sweat - as a spectator sport.
A lot of things happened at the Hippeburg at the Burggartenfest on Sunday.
The arrangers agreed.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
From time to time the entrance had to be stopped.
“It was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
For the Open Air in Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
And the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was revealed early on Sunday when the first visitors opened to the Open Air.
A celebration for all generations was promised by the organizers.
And they have succeeded.
Around the supply stations on the castle gardenwiese it had made it comfortable for salts, but also guests from the nearer and further surroundings.
They followed the first live shows, wiped with the foot in the tact, cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and pleasure were required.
Thro the generations.
While one flushed on the roofs on the extra attached white sand on the beach bar, the other flushed on a quarter of wine in the vineyard, the teenager flushed on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in child makeup, the volunteers in the true sense of the word had to do all their hands to become the master of the spirit and to wreck imaginative creations into the little faces.
The larger used the kickert tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from salt beans.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 he sparked on the visitors, especially families searched for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not break this.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
Therefore, a repetition of the big party in the coming year is not against.
Although the content and size of the event is still to be worked out, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday against the people's vote.
As annoying, he stated that the entry had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company was booked with too little strength.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the ground anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler Mitorganisator spoke of about 1,200 visitors who tumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with the tone technique.
The salty hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox broke out their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a half-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges were not able to be built because the tents were not able to be brought to salts due to a tire pan.
“They will be there next year,” the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful by the visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will still be forgiven at the first time, but must be removed at the second edition.
Also on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to criticize.
“Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more,” says Melanie Meier on the event page.
“Sorry, you’ve taken over a little,” says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don’t see the initial problems as close.
I find it very good that some are not only stupid but also really trying to put something on their feet.
“Take off!” writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
The organizers have a year to give up these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's signs shrink
This is not as expected.
Instead, the ready-made component is waiting to be used in the marked building.
The action is in the context of a larger action: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the hole, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom, with a diameter of 47.5 meters, will be slightly smaller than the old.
The size remains a world record.
The last step towards the completion of the new cage is the cage exchange.
The upper quarter of the old hole is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new warehouse is placed.
If the weather plays, the event is scheduled to go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
The participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge wrapped Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when her cold water was thrown over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully along.
A woman was taken to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she wiped out the kiver.
Isabelle Roberts, from the UK, cried so much when her cold water was thrown over her head that she damaged her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I was crying, and while I did, my boiler just stood," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is shed over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn’t go, the cider was hidden, and then I realized that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw that too and made themselves almost in the pants before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency.
The 20-year-old from the UK was taken to the hospital to get her kidney back after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and a thousand times linked to Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castles soon go back to a strip?
Lastly, there was repeated intersection between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
The Board of Directors are considering possible cooperation.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, the former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
Even a year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfriends Wolfratshausen.
Explicitly differently, so far, the views of how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps move towards each other: discussions about a joint action are expected to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the association presidents Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could meet once,” Sjöberg says.
He believes that all members of the two associations could be pulled back to one line in the future.
This means that successes are seen faster.
While the castle friends around the suddenly dead Richard Dimbath had up to the last in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and vividification" of the land is in the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, the second chairman of the city friends, was very pleased with the call, according to his own details.
Since Dimbath's death, he stands in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman will be found in a meeting in mid-September.
Currently, according to the 74-year-old, the association has about 40 members.
“After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first left the association activities rest from respect.”This ‘think phase’ was needed to ‘think about how it could continue.”
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into talks with the Burgverein.
Until then, the town friends could also make an current mood picture within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I'm sure someone will find himself."He himself doesn't want to apply because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very pleased to continue working."
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the restoration of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the population, as well as through volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: “I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time I’ve got more and more convinced that it’s meaningful to drive the project forward.”It could be created a “total setting character” for the river city.
There is nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be funded by EU grants, visitors’ tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally don't want to throw the idea of reconstruction on board," he hopes that the castle association may move somewhat at this point.
Their goal is to document the story first, “is important and good.”
Then you could see further.
Closing ways to save on university teaching books
Since the cost of university teaching books for many students is more than $1,000 per year, Fast-Seventh Graduate student Matt Schroeder thought about a smart savings idea.
He invented a lease system for high school students' books and offered a nominal compensation to delay the re-sales.
"My math book usually costs $180 but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a cake," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $430, he said.
He gave $120.
The college leadership that students spend more than $1,200 a year on teaching books and study materials, but there are different cost reduction options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the shifts are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.
Renting books becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when purchasing.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Survey in the industry shows that about a quarter of the books were leased in the college bookstores in the last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores Trade Association.
Here is the one-line for the best deals.
Buying online
Some new books online only cost one-third of the price they have in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs $290, but can be picked up at the specialized bookmaker Chegg.com for $239.99.
Needed to buy
If the notes of other or normal usage tracks do not make anything to one, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenditure is permitted.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the workshops.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be acquired for a fraction of the cost for the latest expenditure.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is a popular alternative to used books.
Rental
Renting teaching books is worth consideration if you treat them somewhat well, remember to give them back and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please be informed about the terms of the business in which you hire, including the penalties that may be applied for writing notes, submissions or user traces.
If you don’t return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
The eBooks
E-books instead of traditional teaching books are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesale companies such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg, you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering lectures can be very expensive.
Surely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is going to go to Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends the ISBN number for book pricing as you can be so sure to find the right curriculum.
And before an online order one should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually available.
This lesson he taught on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Hasn't Become a Cash Storage
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" spent less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only spent $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape", adapted to Cameron Diaz, earned only $14.6 million in the opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon Teeth Made Easy 2" also disappointed in the revenue.
A article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children’s films the lack of quality in the films could be the cause.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" to date for children's movies and described "Dragon Teeth Made Easy 2" as a pure "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, with films for a slightly older target audience, it seems like the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer film start that was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year on at least 2,000 screen walls.
The results are based on the opinion of film visitors and film critics and indicate that this year’s film hits are equivalent to the last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s soon-appearing Jungle Book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think the times are changing.”
We need to accept that and not try to go back to the past.
Unlike the currently weak cash outcomes of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently made sales with streaming content of $1.2 billion, twice as much as last year, with sales of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the filmstudies for too much focusing on comic filming and prophetizing a "core mix" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current deviation, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could entirely contain a true core.
However, due to the potential casinos expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The X-Men producer, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash outcomes as simply "cyclic" and told Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema box at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted in order to strangle the league division, that was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result is that whoever has not risen has risen.
Thus, Göttingen's highest class team Torpedo in the Oberliga delegation has avoided the fall, but it's only playing fifth in the next season.
Fourth-class remains Torpedos ladies, despite their magnificent diameter in the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve appear in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttinger clubs represented.
For the women, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What from the composition looks like a better district class is now the new districtsoberliga South.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league they play as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the match.
In the district league starts Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen.
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Even the district league stage of the SCW boys - there Torpedo II is still starting - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional union, the two Göttinger Circular starts with nine teams each.
In the West Staffel are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East Staffel play among others Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode, where there are no female teams on the circle level anymore.
Surprising that none of the six 2nd circular classes will reach silence, the innovative and transformative circular board will have to think about it once.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Last weekend there were protests from the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called opposition summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments for us this weekend and talked with protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew from the Blue Mountains
Two young bus fighters were saved with the seal wind after they were caught over the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Angry relatives called the police around 20 a.m. when the two were not returning home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke out and the couple were found around 23:00 near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had been injured on the knee and the man had fallen down and had opened his head.
The rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flew out on Monday morning.
They were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The protesters were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, information minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The broadcaster recalled the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with stakes had damaged the equipment in the editorial.
Dead or injured were not.
The protesters demand the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of election fraud.
Police said about a kilometer away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, about 3,000 demonstrators and security forces collided again on Monday.
According to the hospital, a police officer was injured.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when protesters tried to enter Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military, after a meeting in the army headquarters on Sunday evening, called for a political solution to the conflict, "to waste time and to apply without violence."
According to the statement, “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has raised concerns about an intervention by the military, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri continue since the Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to stand out.
“We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri expressed the same.
Khan accuses Sharif to have won the parliamentary elections in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had first kept peacefully in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri invited them to move to Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory at third place in the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week ended for Rapid on Sunday.
“The victory is very liberating,” said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate point with the outcome in the Europa League on Thursday.
“The success experience was incredibly important,” confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who advanced in the third place with green-white.
Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season’s victory and goes with a successful experience into the country’s game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Foreign Defender Thomas Schrammel, who with his magnificent leadership Volley from the Sixteen Rack in the 14th minute put the wings to victory.
“I thought I was cleansing the whole frustration of Thursday and scratching it under the latte,” the 26-year-old said with a smile.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga party on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first champion in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
“It’s something very special for me, I’m from the Rapid Nursery,” Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic’s short-term baking blessure, Schrammel turned from the left to the right defensive side and also there did his thing very well.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in mirror traffic.
The gate he deserved, he has already done some assists today,” Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flanke to 2:0 by Hofmann after more than an hour, which eventually brought the decision.
Before that, the guests could also write.
“Thank you, we’ve been a little lucky today,” said Schrammel, who played on the match of performance and outcome in the past weeks: “The results didn’t vote, but the gameplay was always good compared to the last year.”
Barisic even found that he had been "better in many matches before than today" - against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium."
The first triangle since July 26 has therefore demonstrated that the team is intact despite the reverses: "Today my team has demonstrated that it has a character."
Not less pleasant to him: “We’ve finally played too zero again.”
The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up fees, makes the victory even more valuable.
“It should not be forgotten,” said Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, “which have been very stable in the past time.”
The land play break should therefore be used to “leak the wounds and sink a little in the physical area,” said Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in his rows.
One of the people in which the break is special is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks out for the team, goes over pain over it.
It is in this difficult phase that he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "You can't believe that everything is fine now" "We've probably had a little luck, but some time the luck must come back to us.
Now it was the highest time,” Hofmann said.
He said, “You must not always see it black and white.
We haven’t played so bad in the past few weeks as we’ve been shown.
But we should not believe that everything is fine now.
The importance of his role for the team he could not contest.
It’s a very young team that I can help very much.
In some phases, they still stick to me,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to accuse himself and his team.
He regretted the rapid opponent "from the magic gate category", as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongly denied by judges colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough in some stages.
We had too little conclusions.
Internal defense officer Maximilian Karner saw it similar: “It started badly, but then we found it clean and even made a gate.
In general, there would have been more.
Under this Wipfel runs tranquility.
A powerful tribe we showed in our mysterious show of the summer series "My Piece of the Rhöner Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the countryside, the drawn exemplary is the "heat rest" above the underwater brunn.
A hollow footway leads up to the 600-year-old hole.
It passes through couples, basalt stone hips and basalt stone seas.
A piece below the stone crash from the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there is it.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it runs beyond the other trees in the surrounding area and reminds with a range of over eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree thumb suggests that it is a spiritual or mysterious place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the name origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishop’s archive and consulted the elderly people from underwheat brunn to find out what connection it has with the gathering.
The result of his research remained the fairly subtle explanation for the name.
Thus, until approximately 80 years ago, the sheep hearts were supposed to have driven their animals out of the underwhelming bruns to the hardly rooted and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal houses exhausted from the rise should have been calmed.
Meanwhile, the area has gained its importance back, because on the wieses actually regains cattle.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
However, when entering the stone collections, you should be cautious, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place of stay for crossroads.
A walkway leads from the underwhite brunn to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are described, which will rise up to Highrhön and invite you to a extensive walk.
Where is the Waterburg?
However, a waterburg that is sought at our next task is rather rare to be found in the height.
The reflection in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the countryside to which the building concept could fit.

After weeks of switches, Italian Prime Minister and EU President Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative resistance on the EU Special Summit last week passed the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the head of EU Foreign Policy, she will be the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the near-government newspaper La Repubblica reflects, the appeal of his favourite Mogherini, also in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects an increase in his “reform package” in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm the left-wing party base that is repeatedly appealing against him, because Mogherini will be assigned to this, though rather modestly.
Against the conservative representatives with the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish president-nominated Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome will make a political compensation.
The EU’s chief diplomat is also the deputy representative of the Commission President Juncker.
The remaining approval of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41 year old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, who has proven and known for its ambition in leading party offices for two decades, will show itself to the “enormous challenges”.
The Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 with the promoted Politologist in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Linksdemocrats), which in 2008 joined the Catholic Central Party Margherita to the present Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini was appointed Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party policy, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional topics of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO invasion in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a military contingent,ined contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the House of Representatives, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Foreign Minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s over 40 percent of votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in the PD cycles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The talks in Brussels, the new EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner has too little diplomatic experience, so it lacks substance, is contained in the PD.
In Brussels, by Poland and the Baltic members, misbelievably realistic accents of Mogherini to the crisis in Ukraine are traced and diffamated as a "Russian-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is intended to be transported directly to South Europe under the circumference of Ukraine, which also serves Italy’s energy insurance.
After Renzi had entered his term as EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
The photos they showed with Putin at the shake hand were taken in Brussels with enthusiasm, as well as inviting the Kremlin head for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people began their training at Emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has previously completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new employees will work in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechanics (two), tools mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the Landkreis Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vor Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new graduates previously attended primary or secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainers of all years, as well as the trainers, will take a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hiking and rafting on the Inn are on the programme.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 in the world.
The number of students distributed over all years is 27.
“Socialists in France should keep their mouth and make France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s most important ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show “your love” for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet formation has been confronted with disagreement with the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay on his side,” he said with a great applause.
As a disturbing gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government will not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a calming of the regulation by the side of Emmanuel Macron, the new minister of economic affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his co-socialists to show "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, pulled the sand into the ghetto where she appeared at a meeting of abstract socialist members and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, spotted the socialists’ constant burial struggles and said they couldn’t imagine the new Valls government will last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not survived even a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter as well," Ms. Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a dissolution of the parliament and said she was confident to stand out as a winner in the previous elections and was ready for the government.
The ruling party in France was defeated in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing national front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the danger of falling into several rival groups before the end of Holland’s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment rates.
"There's a small window for possibilities, but the public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise service provider, is conducting advanced negotiations on the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customers while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without a result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean Sea, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is approximately $29 billion and is expected for it in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulatory authorities for the exchange in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and casino company under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise entered the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP 8 percent of the company.
According to the original application documents, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have more than 82% of the passenger capacity of U.S. cruise ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A Beijing-true group swallowed the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday, allowing only two or three candidates for the 2017 Hong Kong presidential election.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied by trusted members of Beijing.
This decision would make it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and encouraged pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and with the “Occupy Central” protests to shut down the financial square of Hong Kong.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong; and the leadership of China fears that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China’s domination over Hong Kong was presented in June, Democratic activists held an informal referendum on the election process in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched in the city’s business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese connection office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Committee of the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-Director of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted within the course of the day.
Student activists announced to gather in the afternoon before the head office in Hong Kong.
Until the end phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, the UK did not see any democratic elements.
Putin calls on Kiev to start “state talks” with Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday, according to Russian media reports, that the Ukrainian government should stop the struggles against separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state" of the abolished region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory controlled by the separatists of Eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status against Ukraine should be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an eye-to-face with the pro-Russian rebels fits with the strategy he apparently pursued since the beginning of the excavations five months ago: assistance to the separatists in the acquisition of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossija region the actual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recover the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were occupied in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorosia" or "Neurosland", a term that reminds of the pre-revolutionary glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on October 26 and while government groups attack civil communities in the areas held by separatists hopefully soon peace talks are "found in their illusions", Itar-Tass.
“We need to immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and state status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskow said Putin's reference to statehood should be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to disperse fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, Peskov said.
It’s not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it’s not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification on the correction of Putin's "fake interpretation" of the comments emphasized Russia's leadership's claim to deal with the separatist rebellion in the east, contrary to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulties in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict showed a wide majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over a territory that connects the Russian state territory with the Crimea.
The peninsula annexed five months ago in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy as well as an important trade port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostow region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and fertilizers that make important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation – after the new elections – should take into account additions to the constitution, which will give the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp opposition to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and rebellion Moscow is accused.
Putin's last invitation to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders followed a further push of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks penetrated the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in eastern Ukraine.
The separatists supported by Russia took over the control of Nowoasovsk in the strike, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea.
For this reason massive civil and military preparations have begun to fix Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urged for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
“We are close to a point where there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not resolve any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers penetrated the Donetsk region last week to support the occupied separatists, said Oberst Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday with 10 Russian Fallscreen Hunters captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Scandal of Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not hurt about his trouble about hackers who probably stole naked images of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the A-Promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal on Promis on the Internet.
The hacker has 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star of the Tribute of Panem and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also private photos due to an iCloud gap.
The list contains 101 promises.
Edelest, who had married Grecko last month, told Confidential, “It’s angry.”
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disclosed to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said reports, according to a news site, that the hack was “dangerous” and that the affected people felt “self injured”.
The hacker probably has 30 images of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two images in which she lies up without in a pool.
Palmers' films include "Love is unbeatable" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actor Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence' told TMZ: "It is a disgraceful violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing more than selling hehlerware."
Clearly legal, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer took part yesterday at the 8th round on the Großen Feldberg and so supported the association "Help for Cancer Sick Children".
The tour, which was a torture for one, was a easy training for the others.
But in one, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhause took a bicycle to the Feldberg yesterday.
for the good purpose.
The small muscle cat can be easily removed from there, especially because the participation in the 8th wheel on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for Cancer Sick Children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought a valuable insight.
A great thing.
“I know I can do it now – fine!”
A little puppy in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped, it would have gone out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler City Parliament, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday in the Early Tree to the Mountains and came close to the fatigue, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the about 11 kilometers long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The green politician from the circular day - red dress, red bike - did at the start something more on understatement ("Every lot of professionals, there is the destination!"), but then on the mountain it proved half a professional and went through the destination after 45 minutes without breathing.
He has also passed the route in a break, as well as Nina Kuhn, the press spokeswoman of the city of Oberursel, who had made himself on the way together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg racing" was not necessarily a sports challenge: "Here it's about charity, we're happy to be with it - a trip we'd have done today anyway," Kuhn said.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went down to Oberursel in the morning to strump back to the height immediately afterwards.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swallowed himself home at 9 a.m. in the satellite, "made" the Feldberg twice to then roll home with fun.
It’s also fun with “Tony”.
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks, cycling tours over the Feldberg simply belong to it.
He had spent 40 minutes with his 6.5 kilograms race.
A mad event.
For this purpose, I’m happy to be there,” said Andreas Balzke.
The courageous mainzer says of himself that he is a "ambitious racing rider".
That he must be, because he was on the road with the "Fixie" wheel, that's even racing wheels, but without switches...
That even without a wheel, it went slowly up, not only the 20 walkers who climbed up over the White Wall and the fuchstance to the top, but also a rider who carved a car tyre with weights behind him on a cordon.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, saved for safety, said: "I know him" from Frankfurt, who is training for a special slittrail, only that he stops the slit itself."
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - were sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The walkers first at 9:30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 p.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers launched.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For the next year he hopes that it will succeed in blocking the route to Feldberg up for the safety of the participants.
