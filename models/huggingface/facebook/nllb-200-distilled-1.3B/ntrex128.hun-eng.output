Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid of being in the Muppet Show.
Some members of the National Assembly have been resistant to the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm was raised when it was suggested that the Assembly should be called the Welsh Parliament.
Now, deputies from all political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title will make fun of them.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that their new name would rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For the benefit of our non-Welsh readers, in Welsh twp means one-eyed and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the whole group was dissatisfied and therefore proposed alternatives.
One Conservative MP said his group was open to the name change, but noted that the MWP was only a leap from the Muppet.
It is noteworthy that in Welsh the letter w is pronounced similarly to u in Yorkshire English, or MWP pronounced map.
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drafting the bill introducing the name change is as follows: The final decision on the titles of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the deputies.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 allowed the National Assembly for Wales to change its name.
The Commission published in June the results of a public consultation which proposed the inclusion of the Welsh Parliament and which received widespread support.
As regards the title of the Members, the Commission prefers the title Welsh Parliament Member and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation has favoured the alternative of MWP.
The MPs are coming up with new and new alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is causing concern for the Speaker of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the name changes in the coming weeks.
The Law on Reforms will also affect other points in the functioning of the National Assembly, including the disqualification of deputies and the structures of the committees.
The final vote on the question of their own title will be taken by the deputies during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday to change the country's name from North Macedonia to the Republic of .
The referendum aims to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, one of whose provinces is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its name for its northern neighbour is essentially a territorial claim and has repeatedly objected to its EU and NATO accession request.
President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, himself opposes the referendum on the name change and will not participate.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply a compromise they must make for their EU and NATO membership.
The churches of Harlem are in trouble, the bells of St. Martin's have gone off.
"In the old days, I hear from the elders, there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams says.
Today, none of them are.
As you say, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
"People are socializing differently these days", he says.
Bars are no longer the communal living rooms that people go to every day.
As for the churches, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not fulfill the leaders' hopes, and that in time they will be back where they started.
And instead of churches, it will be built residential buildings whose communities also do not help the fate of the remaining churches.
The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white  he claims , which further accelerates the final closure of the churches as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments will join the faith.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black city -- Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the '30s.
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who is known for leading a boycott of the 125th Street Harlem shopping malls that refuse to employ black people or sell black products.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell tower was built at the request of the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's Parish, proudly referred to the bell ringing as the "Poor Bells".
In July, the expert who spoke about the bell said that the bell is a cultural heritage, an irreplaceable instrument of historical importance.
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the world's first bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had begun playing the larger bell in the Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't hire anyone to replace him.
In the last few months, a complicated situation has developed in St. Martin's involving architects and contractors, hired partly by the church's lay leadership and partly by the bishop's office.
The parish's governing body, the parish council, wrote to the bishop's office in July, complaining that the office was reimbursing the council for its expenses, even though the council had not been involved in selecting the architects and contractors hired by the office.
Some members of the congregation complain about the lack of transparency in the office building.
A 13-year-old California boy was attacked by a shark while fishing for crab
Official reports say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was crab fishing on the opening day of the crab fishing season in California on Saturday.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he noticed a boy screaming for help, and he and most of the crew sailed over to help him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a crab, but then he realized that the boy was screaming "He bit me!"
He bit me!
With his shoulder torn at the collarbone, Hammel described what he saw when he reached the boy.
I started yelling for everyone to get out of the water. There's a shark in the water.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
As rescue captain Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, sharks had been spotted in the area, but then it was determined that they were not a danger to humans.
Captain Giles also said the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities closed the beach between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for the duration of the investigation and for safety reasons.
Giles says that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would expand into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's, with its expert salesmen and department store style piper stands, would compete with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its drive to expand into the £2.8 billion UK beauty market amid falling sales of fashion and household goods, the chain is testing larger piper stands in 11 stores nationwide, with more to follow from next year if successful.
The rise of the pipeline is due to the various ways in which stores are trying to fill the shelf space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double its offering to 3,000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it is now offering for the first time.
But the earlier brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be placed in larger areas in branded stands like Boots and similar stores to meet customers.
The chain is also relaunching the Boutique make-up line, where most products are now vegan  as they are now sought after by an increasing number of young customers.
Fragrance Shop is also testing its presence in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the other is due to open this year in Birmingham's Selly Oak.
With the spread of online shopping and the shift of food shopping habits to small local shops, department stores must do more to entice customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the offering will become more similar to its retailers as the chain tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and products other than food.
Since the acquisition of the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened Argos and some Habitat locations in hundreds of stores. This has also had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The chain's previous attempt to wrinkle-free its beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but a dispute over the distribution of revenues from its pharmacy business ended that.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's's pharmaceutical business, which operates 281 stores, to Celesia, who runs the Lloyds chain, for £125 million three years ago.
According to the chain, Lloyds will be involved in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skincare products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: We want to make our customers feel more comfortable by changing the look of our pipeline.
We also hired qualified staff to help with counseling.
Our branded offerings cater for all needs, while the attractive environment and easy-to-reach location provide an allure that takes the shopping experience to a new level.
Peter Jones has been relieved after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones has left in dismay after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a $11 million deal to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, the home wear and accessories brand.
The two celebrities' businesses have been compared to the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was stepping down.
Holly Willoughby has thoroughly pulled the trigger on Dragons Den star Peter Jones when he quit their promising lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his own highly lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was stunned when the TV star announced during a tense meeting at the Jones business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that his new contracts, worth a total of £1.5 million, meant he did not have enough time left to devote to their joint brand of home wear and accessories, Truly.
The two celebrities' ventures have been compared to the Goop brand previously listed by Gwyneth Paltrow and were expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the island country for one of his resorts.
According to one source, "Truly was the most important thing to Holly by far".
He was going to be doing this for the long term, and it's going to be his livelihood for the next few decades.
Her leaving was a complete surprise to everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, because the departure was so close.
The warehouse at Marlow's office is full of merchandise waiting to be sold.
Experts say the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of dollars, thanks to the huge sums invested in everything from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear, and potential slippage.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-child host and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby and Capp launched Truly back in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over as president in March.
The two couples often vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the new M&S product line and will take over from Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night: "We do not wish to comment on [Jones'] business dealings".
We were talking about hard things, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider unpresidential, and for making such positive statements about the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump let you go so fast?
"said Trump in a funny news reader voice.
I didn't let anyone in.
As he noted, Kim would be happy to meet a second time after the first summit in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean Representative Ri Jong-ho told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country saw no "adequate response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the US will continue to maintain pressure sanctions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his campaign speech.
"Things are going great with North Korea", he said.
We were supposed to go to war with them.
Millions of people would have died.
But now we have a very good relationship.
As you said, your efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results in terms of ending missile tests, releasing hostages and bringing American troops home.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
"Being president is not hard, but there's not a crowd of 10,000 out there trying to get in, there's only about 200 people standing in front of me", Trump said, pointing to the group in front of him.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia as a tsunami and earthquake rocked the island
Indonesia has also refused to accept international aid organizations' help after the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be evacuated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid to arrive.
In the past, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not need international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult  said Sumbung.
Save the Children is already working to establish a relief team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in the rescue operations.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were currently assessing the situation in Palu to see if international aid agencies needed to be involved.
Despite the fact that Indonesia is routinely hit by earthquakes, the country is extremely unprepared to face the devastating force of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are not common in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was in place, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning system in Palu also contributed to the disaster that claimed lives.
Even in the best of weather, travel between Indonesian islands can be difficult.
Logistics are even more problematic during natural disasters.
A hospital ship in Lombok is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the focus of his election campaign and spared no expense on road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits ahead of next year's election.
The president also faces ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced by riots in which Christian and Muslim gangs fought each other in the streets with lawnmowers, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has scored a huge equalising goal against Chelsea
In a Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, a goal scored in the 89th minute by Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from relegation to Chelsea.
His side were down 0-1 when Sturridge was given a goal by Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal.
He put the ball to the left, then he kicked a big kick into the far corner of the goal.
The shot flew high over the sixteenth, and the net flew to the upper right corner.
The ball finally landed in the net over the pitching Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"I just wanted to get in position because there's always someone like Shaq who's going to put the ball forward, so I tried to get myself in the best position possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, I just took it off, and then I didn't think long and I shot him.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute to take the lead.
The blue side's corner, Mateo Kovacic, then managed to break through the middle of the field and run into Liverpool's court.
Kovacic, after a quick pass, went out and got the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful pass to put Hazard in the 16th.
Hazard ran the defense and finally sent the ball with a left-handed shot into the far corner of the Liverpool goal next to Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will now play Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday afternoon at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea play Videoton on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in London in the UEFA Europa League.
832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the local disaster agency announced on Sunday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday and the resulting 20-foot-high (6.0 m) tsunami left several people buried under the rubble, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The streets of Palu, a city of more than 380,000, are covered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the stabbing case.
Police have opened a murder investigation after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman, covered in stab wounds, was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been taken into custody on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents in the area to report anyone who has seen anything or is dead.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, however, I would like to ask anyone who has been in the area of John Street in Birkenhead and who may have seen or heard anything to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, if you have any onboard camera footage, to contact us as well, because you may have information relevant to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman killed was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived to find out where the body was found in the early morning hours.
The investigation is ongoing and police are notifying the victim's family.
A cab driver in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but police informed him that no one was allowed in or out of the building at this time.
When he found out what had happened, the man couldn't even speak.
Residents have been told that it may be several hours before they can re-enter the building.
One of the officers told someone that the entire building is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with her tears.
"This is terrible", she repeated.
At 2:00 this afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon, and another outside.
There were several police officers inside the cordon watching the block.
Anyone with any information can write to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, and refer to file 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever
The statue's banishment may be a poetic justification for why Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers destroyed England's cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with Taliban enthusiasm at the time.
But according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's proposal is "madness", an attempt to rewrite history.
According to John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, "It was inevitable that at some point in the current debate over the removal of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace would become a target.
During the English Civil War, the destruction of images was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
So perhaps another Cromwell could be a victim of the actions of his predecessor, Thomas, of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive portrayal of Cromwell reflects the views of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure who many still consider to be worthy of celebration today.
In this regard, Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is perhaps less so today than at the end of the 19th century, but yet many see Parliament as a protector against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this picture is accurate is still a matter of historical debate.
But what is certain is that this conflict, which broke out in the middle of the 17th century, shaped the future of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents one side of that conflict.
And his achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance.
A murderous pig wounds a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and fatally wounded a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man identified only as Yuan was found covered in blood and with a torn collarbone next to a pig in a market in Liupanshui, Kuizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China on 30 May 2005.
The man and his cousin had traveled from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man's body and discovered that the door was unlocked by the neighboring pig.
He said the mouth of the giant candy cane in the pigsty was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation revealed that the 250-pound pig did indeed bite its owner to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and torn apart", said a relative who was identified only by his last name, Wuke, as reported by the Guiyang Evening News.
According to the security cameras, Yuan entered the pigsty at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's property.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from harming others while police searched the scene for clues.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, pig attacks on humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a couple on their farm in Massachusetts were attacked by a pig, causing life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 1,000-pound pig in Wales had squeezed a farmer's tractor until the man's wife failed to alert him.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba spoke on CBC News about how pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can make them aggressive.
They're very playful.
Like little children, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them respect", he said.
Heavy rains in the wake of Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it hits colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will continue to cause heavy rains in the coming days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa, with winds of 140 miles per hour, became a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday, 400 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone forms over the Pacific Ocean and heads west toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, it will flood the southwestern United States with heavy tropical wetlands as a tropical storm.
The storm is expected to bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the approaching tropical steam, meeting the low pressure masses, will cause heavy rains in the southwest for the next few days.
Here, 10 inches of rain can cause flash floods, flooding with debris, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical steam can occasionally bring up to 2 inches [58 cm] of rain per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, some areas are forecast to receive 5 to 10 inches of rain, mostly in Arizona.
Sudden floods can also occur, with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
Especially during the rainy season, it is not recommended to start walking in the desert.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can be accompanied by sudden gusts of wind and dust.
The approaching low pressure mass could cause heavy rainfall in some places along the Southern California coast.
Up to 1.5 cm of precipitation is possible, which can cause minor flooding with debris and slippery road conditions.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Tropical showers are expected in Arizona Sunday night and Monday morning, with more rainfall expected Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations will be experienced in the United States as the Arctic masses cool, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences over short distances in some places.
A prime example of this is a situation in the Midwest on a Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 40 degrees Fahrenheit [10°C].
In the coming days, the summer heat is expected to be felt again in larger areas.
In the central and eastern United States, warm weather is expected in the first half of October, with temperatures in the vicinity of 90 degrees Fahrenheit [25°C] from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of the northwest.
The temperature in New York City will reach 85 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast says temperatures in the eastern United States will likely exceed average temperatures until mid-October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
Over 20 million viewers on six television networks have followed the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock has not been resolved and broadcasters have had to interrupt regular programming due to a last-minute twist Friday when Arizona Senator Jeff Flake was able to negotiate a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% certain that at that time, at a high school party, he grabbed Kavanaugh and tried to strip him.
In his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
The statements were probably seen by more viewers on Friday than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
Nielsen calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has difficulty measuring the number of people who watch the shows at work.
For comparison's sake, that's the average viewership for football officials or the Academy Awards.
Nielsen said that of all the channels, Fox News Channel, which featured experts supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest ratings, averaging 5.69 million viewers for the entire day of the hearing.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had a 3.1 rating, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Interest didn't diminish after the hearing.
The star of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement saying it was voting for Senator Kavanaugh, he was seen on CNN and CBS Friday morning being greeted by a loud crowd of protesters as he attempted to get into the elevator to the Judiciary Committee.
He stood there for a few minutes, tearfully, as the crowd shouted at him and CNN broadcast the scene live.
I'm standing here in front of you, said a woman to the senator.
Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth to the public of this country?
The crowd shouted, "You have done what no woman has done".
Flake only said that his office had issued a statement, and then before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share his story at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast channels then broadcast live hours later as the committee voted on whether to put Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote before the full Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do so if the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate next week, as the minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was convinced of the need for this by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision was based on discussions with Coons and later other senators.
Flake's decision was a proper exercise of his power, because it was obvious that without an investigation, the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses anti-Brexit politicians of political games
In an interview with the Sunday Times on Sunday, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics that would jeopardise the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the nation's interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that appears on the front page of the paper directly alongside May's interview, May's former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacks May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the idea of Britain and the EU handling each other's tariffs is utterly absurd.
The Wayde Sims murder: police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been taken into custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Police released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and also reported that Sims' glasses fell during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene, and Simpson's DNA was on it, on CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson was questioned, police announced that the young man had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the Advocate, the court has set bail at $350,000.
A preliminary report from the East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office on Friday said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Crime Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the University Police and the community for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their commitment and perseverance in uncovering the truth.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said news of Sims' death was devastating and shocking to the team.
"You're always afraid of something like this happening", Wade said.
Volcano washes ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
After the crater's volcanic activity intensified, and a total of 183 gas and ash explosions occurred in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center urged the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also recorded several rumblings and tremors.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, images on social media show a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano, 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Mexico City, after a magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's split referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint dust at the police, so that the streets, once crowded with tourists, were now covered with thick dust.
Later in the day, more fights broke out, with police using rubber batons to try to keep order.
Independence groups chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" and unity protesters marching behind the slogan "Viva España" stood face to face for hours.
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions continue to rage in the region, which has been plagued by independence struggles, following the October 1 referendum that Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists celebrated.
Voters voted overwhelmingly in favour of secession, although turnout was rather low, as most Unionists boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to stop voting at polling stations with actions that culminated in violent clashes.
Independence groups were on the streets all night on Friday to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although the demonstration was not stopped, it did not go on the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist demonstrations with his wife, said there was no chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents cry tears of joy because we could vote, but now our cause is over", he said.
Despite a significant, even narrow, victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties are struggling to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders in voluntary exile or in custody awaiting a court ruling over their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a demonstration in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense", he says.
One of the Catalan leaders, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody since last year, announced on Saturday that he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
I can say that I am most strongly against the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government is representing by me standing as a candidate in the European elections  she said.
Londonderry police arrest three men for driving into a house
Police have arrested a 33-, 34- and 39-year-old man for driving into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at approximately 19:30 BST at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings says the gate and the building itself were damaged.
There may have been a gunshot to the car at some point.
With a Menga goal, Livingston beat the Rangers by 1  0.
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
Livingston, a newly promoted player, surprised the Rangers by taking the second defeat of Steven Gerrard, who has been the manager of the Ibrox club for 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference as Gary Holt's team was in a dead heat with Hibernian in second place.
So the Gerrards remain unbeaten in the Scottish league this season and next Sunday they face Hearts, who are eight points behind in the top flight.
But before that, the Rangers have a game against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its division-leading streak to six wins, which means Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, is still out of the lineup.
Livingston missed a number of positions against an inaccurate away team.
Holt's team could have taken the lead well before the game's only goal, as they caused quite a few problems for the Rangers with their offensive play.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but he held off the attack too long, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after he slipped to catch Craig Halkett's cross-headed ball in front of the goal line.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game because they were sure they could distract the guests in the recorded game situations.
The decisive goal was born from exactly this situation.
The Rangers had a free kick and Livingston found a gap in the defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a position for Menga, who took advantage of that to kick from the middle of the 16th.
At this point in the game, the Rangers were leading in possession, but the home defense was still invincible, and Liam Kelly's goal was barely in jeopardy.
This trend continued into the second half of the game, except for one occasion when Kelly had to defend against Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was blocked by Rangers goalie Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed a shot from Livingston's free throw.
Crossed balls continued to arrive in Livingston's 16th, but defenders deflected each time. Two penalties were missed by the attacking team: one for Halkett's entrance against Glenn Middleton, who came on as a substitute, and the other for handling.
Fanatic  play by Livingston  match analysis
This is Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland's correspondent, reporting from the Tony Macaroni Arena.
Livingston was phenomenal and cutting the wages.
The players performed exceptionally well, one by one, and exceeded expectations.
The team's members and style of play have changed little since they returned to the front, but Holt's efforts are also worthy of serious praise, as the coach has been a great motivator for the team since his arrival.
Several players have brought him to his best.
Halkett was a team captain with a powerful defense, and Menga was a sweat on Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers played without a plan.
As well as they have done under Gerrard, they have not been able to match that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula  they only managed to break the home defense once anyway , so the Rangers have to pick up the pieces quickly as they've slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdoğan received a mixed reception in Cologne
A pleasant atmosphere and good cheer characterised the morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
This was the last day of Erdoğan's divisive visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdoğan then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built massive mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police have banned the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque citing security concerns, but many of the president's supporters have come to see the Turkish president.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, expressed displeasure with Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations are a perfect example of the divisive nature of the president's policies, who is hailed as a hero by some Turkish-German citizens while others see him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist collided with car and died
A cyclist lost his life when he collided with a car in London.
The accident happened at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a major thoroughfare in Deptford, in the southeast part of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics tried to help the cyclist, but he died at the scene.
The collision came just months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
A statement from the London Police said officers were still working to identify the man so they could notify his family.
Roadblocks and bus diversions are making it difficult to get to the area, and authorities are advising drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a maximum-security male prison, the prison administration said.
The riots began at 0930 hours on Sunday morning at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire and have so far been uncontrolled.
Authorities have deployed a special unit called the Tornado to the scene to deal with the situation, which involves eight inmates who have been crammed into a building wing.
The SWAT team suffered minor head injuries that were treated at the scene.
Statement from a spokesman for the Department of Corrections: A specially trained team of prison guards is handling the situation at Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, and we will hand over those responsible to the police and they will be sentenced to additional prison time.
Long Lartin Men's Prison holds over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, reports said that the warden had to be hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the task force was also called in to quell a major riot in which prisoners attacked prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (although drought-stricken areas may be improving)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but that's what the state is expected to face early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep across the desert southwest, dramatically increasing the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has declared a flood watch for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, as well as parts of southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to make a direct pass through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to make landfall Monday night, bringing heavy rain.
The Phoenix Weather Bureau posted the following message on Twitter:  Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within 200 miles of Phoenix in the form of tropical storms or depressions!
Hurricane Katrina in 1967, for example, came within 40 miles of the border of the USA.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 50 to 100 millimeters of precipitation, which can reach 150 millimeters in extreme cases, such as the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (central areas of the Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) 25-50 mm of precipitation can be expected, but in some places it can be up to 100 mm.
The rain brought by Rosa may bring relief to areas not threatened by flash floods, as the region is currently suffering from severe drought.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rains may have a beneficial effect on the drought-stricken southwestern landscape.
The U.S. Bureau of Drought Statistics reports that more than 40 percent of Arizona is in the midst of a minimum extreme drought, ranking it the second-most dangerous category in a weather.com report.
Hurricane Rosa will first make landfall on the Lower Peninsula of California, Mexico.
It will remain a hurricane, and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 85 miles per hour, it will move about 400 miles south of the Punta Eugenia peninsula in Mexico and will move northward at about 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet colder currents in the Pacific and will lose strength.
It is expected to make landfall as a tropical storm on the Mexican coast by Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall is expected in some parts of Mexico, significantly increasing the risk of flooding.
The average rainfall is expected to be 70 to 150 mm from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with some 250 mm in some areas, weather.com reports.
Rosa then moves northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday, becoming a tropical depression before sweeping through Arizona and reaching southern Utah by Tuesday night.
The greatest threat posed by Rosa and its remnants is expected to be extreme rainfall in the deserts of Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern United States, the National Hurricane Center said.
Rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in desert areas, and landslides are to be avoided in mountainous areas.
Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
At 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday, a teenage boy was found injured in the Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace neighborhood.
The boy was rushed to hospital, his condition is stable.
Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
Authorities are asking the public to contact anyone with cell phone records of the incident.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to suffer the wrath and hostility of the Democratic Party.
"Anyone who votes for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had to endure the wrath and hostility of the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford also testified and upheld his earlier claims.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw firsthand Kavanaugh's brilliant and fearless character.
"Votes for Judge Kavanaugh are votes for one of the most distinguished legal professionals of our time, with an impeccable record of public service", Trump told supporters in West Virginia.
The president was making a veiled reference to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I'm not running personally, but I'm running, in fact.
That's why I go everywhere to support the best candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats are pursuing a tactic of space resistance and obstruction.
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds dead in tsunami caused by Indonesian earthquake, death toll rising
Many people were swept away by the floodwaters and at least 384 people died when huge waves washed up on the coast of Indonesia's Sulawesi island, a disaster caused by a powerful earthquake and tsunami, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves nearly 20 feet [18 m] high washed up on the beach at dusk, washing many away and destroying everything in their path.
The flood was triggered by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, did not flee immediately, and became victims of the waves  said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency (DMA) at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The surge didn't just come by itself, it washed cars, logs, houses and everything off the coast", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h in the open sea before it hit the coast.
Some climbed to the top of trees to escape the flood, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters.
Aerial footage released by the agency of the disaster shows several destroyed buildings and businesses, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Saturday, more aftershocks hit the coastal city.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of some 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (TAPA), the earthquake on Friday released about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and the resulting geographical features may have enhanced the tidal effects.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant", with thousands of homes destroyed and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Several bodies were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far is 540, with 29 more people being sought.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even higher in the coastal area 300 kilometers (190 miles) from Palu, in an area called Donggala, because it was closer to the epicenter.
Communication is completely paralyzed, no information can be obtained from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there  The Red Cross said in a statement that its specialists and volunteers were already on their way to the disaster area.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing the public about the surge in Palut, but officials said the waves had already reached the coast when the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man screaming desperately from the top floor of a building to warn people on the street of the approaching flood.
Within minutes, a huge wall of water hits the shore, washing cars and buildings away.
Reuters news agency has not been able to verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages, cutting off communications in the Palu area, making it harder for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has sent aid from Jakarta and other cities in cargo planes, but authorities say the evacuated population will continue to be in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was opened only to facilitate relief work and will be closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up by the Pyongyang government on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian flood is over 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to Palu, where staff took refuge under tent posts set up in the office yard, but encountered terrible destruction along the way, Doseba said.
They said they saw a lot of houses that had fallen down.
It's really bad.
While relief teams began preparing for disaster relief, some complained that foreign specialists with extensive experience in the field were unable to travel to Palur.
Under Indonesian law, all overseas aid, relief supplies and personnel may only be allowed into the country if the disaster site has been declared a disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
The incident is still being treated as a provincial-level disaster said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 Once the government acknowledges that this is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international aid services in, but so far no announcement has been made.
On the second night after Friday's quake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing remain hopeful that their loved ones will be among those whose miraculous escape will shed some light on the dark atmosphere of natural disaster coverage.
On Saturday, during the rescue, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, workers managed to rescue a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has been training two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to the missing, there are other students trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
"As a veteran skydiver, I felt a heavy emotional burden from what happened", he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse began to spread among the skydivers, he spent hours desperately trying to get in touch with the contestants who were attending the beach festival on WhatsApp.
However, instead of two blue pipes, only one grey one appeared alongside the messages.
"I guess that means the messages couldn't be delivered anymore", he said.
$26,750 stolen while loading an ATM at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was charging an ATM at the Newport on the Levee shopping mall, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the money carrier was emptying an ATM at the entertainment center and preparing to fill it with more bills, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
A man approached a Brink's employee from behind while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared bags.
Witnesses saw several suspected perpetrators flee the scene, but the police statement did not give the exact number of suspects.
Anyone with information regarding the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper's name changed to Yere
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye now.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter with the following message: The being formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye by many for some time, and his eighth album, released in June, was also named Ye.
She announced the name change ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to perform her new album, Yandhi.
She's taking over from Ariana Grande, who dropped out of the show for emotional reasons, the show's producer said.
The new name is not just a shortening of the rapper's current stage name  but also has religious significance for West, as he has previously revealed.
I know that Ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means te  West mentioned earlier when he was talking about the title of his album with Big Boy radio host.
So I am you and I am us and we are all one.
Kanye means the one, and that's what made him Ye, which is the good, the bad, the confused, everything that lives inside us.
The album is more about who we really are.
Ye is one of the famous rappers who gladly changes their name.
Sean Combs, for example, has previously run under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he now prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former writing partner, Jay-Z, also varied on whether his name should be written in one, a hyphen, or a capital letter.
The Mexican president has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
On the 50th anniversary of the bloody student protests, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
López Obrador on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square promised that he would never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing some 300 people as leftist student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help Mexican youth by providing monthly financial aid to students and plans to establish more free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI solutions.
As China becomes more active in AI research and development, the United States should double its support for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and employee of AI solutions who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the US government made announcements about artificial intelligence, even though the US does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced related plans: the country aims to become the world's number one AI developer by 2030.
"Doubling the cost of AI research would be a good start, as every other country is significantly behind the US and is on the verge of the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling research funding could also double the chances of the United States making the next big leap in artificial intelligence, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat America's top Othello player, and later served as a board member of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged the results of previous technology competitions announced by the US government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next such event would be held, as this would be an opportunity to find new future-makers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government funding for their research, Lee said.
It's not China that's killing off the scientific leaders, it's big business that's doing it.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired a number of big academic heads over the past few years to work in AI.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also go a long way toward helping the U.S. with its AI efforts.
"I think that people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically get a green card", he said.
The State Council of China announced its plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides support to academic staff in a similar way to the way the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the US Department of Defense created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, an AI center where industry professionals and academics from different fields can work together, and the White House announced the creation of a committee called the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
And the NSF is currently spending $100 million a year to fund AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislature, which had planned to create a national security intelligence committee, has not taken any further action on the issue for months.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name from North Macedonia to the Republic of Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country's EU and NATO membership application from being accepted.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has argued that its northern neighbor's name indicates that it claims a similarly named Greek territory, and has thus far vetoed the country's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the new name in June, but opponents of the national sentiment say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not participate in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the 50% turnout required for a valid referendum.
The question on the ballot says: Do you support the country's membership of NATO and the EU and do you accept the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the ruins of Yugoslavia, to have a chance at EU and NATO membership.
'I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that would mean a safer life for all of us,' said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have declared that they feel bound by the outcome of the vote.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities were reported until 1:00 p.m. on the day of the vote.
However, the turnout has so far been only 16%, compared to 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ended up with 66% of registered voters).
I came to vote for my children because we belong in Europe  said Gjose Tanevski (62), who cast his vote in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted in favor of the name change in Strumica, a referendum on 30 September 2018 that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage in front of the parliament building, along with chairs and tents for the boycott.
We also support the country's membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join with pride, with our heads held high, and not through the door of the maid  said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can go to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would be a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which is struggling with unemployment at over 20%.
"I think the majority will support our cause, because more than 80% of the country's population basically supports EU and NATO membership", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He also added that a "yes" vote would ensure the country's future.
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Science on Monday showed that 30-43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll by Telma TV in Macedonia predicted a turnout of 57% on Sunday.
Of those who want to go to the polls, 70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout must be at least one vote higher than 50%.
The annulment of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government that came to power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, knocks out the entire Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have dealt a thoroughly defensive blow to Brighton, with Manchester City winning 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero scored his 65th-minute goal as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine striker, as the first step in the attack, got a pass in the middle of the field and
He slipped between the three Brighton defenders and made his way out into the open.
Then four green shirts surrounded Aguero.
He knocked out a defender, then ran a few more runs to get close to Brighton's 16.
Then he passed to Sterling, who showed up.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero with a force inside the 16th, who completed the action with his right foot, hitting the right side of Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan's goal.
"Aguerro has a problem with his foot", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that 55, you can play for 60 minutes maximum.
And that's what happened.
Luckily, he scored just then.
Sterling's action gave the Blues their first lead in the English Championship.
The goal came in the 29th minute when
Aguero, who is on the Brighton side, has a great pass.
He threw a beautiful cross to Leroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane played with the ball for a while before he started Sterling for the long jump.
The blue bat just managed to get the ball in the goal before it slipped outside the baseline.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League next Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer's trying to make it harder for the Rockies.
With the Nationals missing out on a playoff spot, there was no reason to really try.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer is looking forward to playing against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance to make the playoffs, as the Rockies have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have secured at least a consolation spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still up in the air.
Despite the fact that we're out of chances, we can still take them on in a way that in Denver, the mood of the crowd and the other team is expected to be at its peak this year.
Of course I'm in the mood to run like this.
The Nationals have yet to pick a starter for Sunday, but word is that Scherzer will be pitching in this situation.
Scherzer, who was in pitching practice Thursday, will make his 34th start on Sunday, which is usually his day off.
The right-handed Washington pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia.
The president also made a veiled reference to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
November will put everything we've accomplished at risk.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, the big ones. I'm not running personally, but I'm running, which is why I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates.
Trump continued, "Everyone can see what these terrible, radical Democratic groups are doing, they can see it with their own eyes.
They are truly determined and will use any means to regain power, showing malice and baseness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they trample on, so they can have control, they can have power.
The president says the Democrats are using space resistance and obstruction.
"They've seen it all in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats angry and malicious and mean and liars.
She mentioned by name Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who had expressed her loud displeasure at the crowd.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait, all that really bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer supportive of diversity.
He doesn't tolerate people who are free to say what they think.
I was not at all surprised when Momentum activists in my own party decided to censor me.
After all, I'm just the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told they're not welcome simply because we've spoken our minds.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly for her unwavering stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors didn't like me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
And the importance of responsible economic policy in matters of national security and Europe, which ironically are the very issues Jeremy also disagreed with his predecessors on.
The invitation to a Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said they wanted a welcoming and productive meeting.
For most of my eight years as a local representative for the Labour Party, these Friday night meetings have been exactly like this.
But today, unfortunately, the tone has changed and the promise of a more restrained, polite policy has been forgotten, if it has ever been realized.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the Labour Party does not tolerate differences of opinion and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This trend started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we had similar political views, have recently increasingly expected me to turn my back on my personal opinions and take a stand on things that I would never otherwise agree with, whether it's national security issues or the single European market.
After every public speech I make, regardless of what I actually say, they start to rant on social media, demanding my replacement, criticizing the policies that push me to the centre, and telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments I get are usually limited to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to face sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, yet they do not run away.
The most frustrating aspect of politics today is that attacks of this magnitude have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the need for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we have given up on diversity and with every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules, the party is becoming less tolerant.
Over the years, many people have advised me to restrain myself, to be less vocal, and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I entered politics.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student, outraged by the Thatcher government's neglect of schools, and then I fought for better public services for those most in need as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views behind a screen, and I did not do otherwise during the last election.
It was clear to everyone in Nottingham East what political views I held and what issues I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I want to say that in this situation, when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will not only hurt families but also companies and public services, I don't see why so much time and energy should be spent questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my most important message is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of replacement or political interference will deter me from acting in my own discretion and in the best interests of all.
Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, has been asked to speak.
Ayr  Melrose 38  17: Ayr breaks through to the top undefeated
Two late attempts have slightly altered the outcome, but there is no doubt Ayr will win the day's most entertaining match, the Tennent's Premiership.
The team currently leads the table as the only undefeated team out of ten.
With their unrivalled defense and superior play, they have won the game, giving the home team and coach Peter Murchie every reason to be pleased.
"We have had to face many challenges in our matches so far, but we are still unbeaten, so we have every reason to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, the Melrose player, said: "We have to admit that Ayr has taken advantage of their situation much better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute shot, which Frazier Climo scored, gave Ayr the lead, and the Warriors' yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes would have allowed Melrose to close the gap, but Jason Baggot's shot was not scored.
Climo hit a penalty to sweat Ayr's defense in the second half, then scored from a one-point attempt to make the score 17-5 in favour of Ayr.
Melrose got off to a strong start in the second half, with Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Bagg, reducing the team's lead to five points.
The game was then stopped for a long time as Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and had to be taken off the field, and in the continuation Ayr further increased their lead with a try from Stafford McDowall, whose bears were reaped with Climo's help.
Blair Macpherson, the captain of the Ayr, was given a yellow card, and the Melrose, in a man-to-man manner, managed to thwart Bruce Colvine's attempt, thus breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started to close again, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for shooting Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line behind Ayr's attacking team.
Climo sold out, which he repeated almost immediately after the restart when Kyle Rowe took down David Armstrong's high kick and sent forward Gregor Henry's switch for the home team's fifth attempt.
The star of Still Game has started a new career in the hospitality industry.
It seems that one of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is moving into the hospitality industry, as it turns out he's head of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor will play Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and stars in with his longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the series will be the ninth season finale, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he became a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has not commented on the news, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan is trying to cash in on Glasgow's booming catering industry.
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the decorated naval command post in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags flying in the city center.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon proclaim the slogan: "We have a right to the sea".
It's our duty to get it back.
In landlocked Bolivia, memories of the lost coast that Chile captured in a bloody 19th-century conflict for resources are still alive, and the desire to once again ride the waves of the Pacific is strong.
Perhaps the most powerful moment in decades for such hopes has come as Bolivia awaits the October 1 ruling of the International Court of Justice, the culmination of five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the ball, which will infuse the spirit of solidarity and peace into the people who are looking forward to the final outcome in a positive mood", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are watching the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the hope that the Hague tribunal will stand with Bolivia and force Chile to sit down at the negotiating table after decades of rapsodious behavior to give Bolivia autonomous access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia who faces a controversial fight to be re-elected next year, may have a lot to lose with Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said in late August.
Some analysts, however, feel that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and that even if it did, it would not make much difference.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no jurisdiction to rule on Chilean territory and has also agreed in advance not to influence the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling came just six months after the closing remarks indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the last four years have not only helped the Bolivian cause, but they've even turned it down.
The issue of the sea route has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes  developed by Zarrate.
 Morales' hostile rhetoric has eroded the remaining goodwill of Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will certainly resume negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to start a dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries haven't delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagreed with the conclusion that the court decision would have been unusually swift.
Monday will be an exceptional opportunity for Bolivia to open a new chapter in relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of conflict and get the best of both worlds, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime dispute to forge a political advantage.
Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean.
The verdict gives us the opportunity to see: it's time to move on from the past.
North Korea: No nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho says his country won't be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri was speaking before the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made at the Singapore summit of the leaders of the two rival countries.
The comments come as it appeared US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had managed to restart stalled nuclear talks more than three months after his Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri said he was willing to believe that continued sanctions and American obstruction of the declaration ending the Korean War would ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang makes significant progress toward disarmament.
Both Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's commitment to disarmament, which it likely sees as the only key to its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows have featured the huge headgear that will soon be seen in high-end stores
If you're looking to expand your hat collection or to completely cover the day, you don't have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of unusually oversized headgear as part of their Spring/Summer 2019 collection, which was greeted with enthusiasm by the stylish audience at Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats have been a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the above fashion designers have put their eye-catching work on the runway.
Valentino's most striking piece was an exaggerated beige hat with a feathery, wide brim that almost completely engulfed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included a gem-encrusted pumpkin, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, which were not really designed to keep the human head warm.
Thom Browne also came out with a bizarre mask selection just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had their mouths sewn together and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of these pieces looked like a diving mask, complete with a pipe and glasses, and another looked like a melting ice cream cone.
If you're into these spectacular pieces, you're in luck.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may be on their way to high-end clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the trail of the La Bomba, a two-inch-wide straw hat that we've seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the social media-obsessed, impractical hat has unveiled another piece on the runway: a straw beach bag that's almost the size of a swimsuit model.
The dark orange raffia bag  decorated with raffia bushes and topped with a white leather handkerchief  was one of the highlights of Jacquemus' 2019 La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the star's stylist, told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the giant hats and beach bags in high-end clothing stores next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizenship
Independent schools in Scotland have a tradition of providing excellent education, and recent outstanding test scores have not changed this in 2018, only reinforced by individual and group successes in sport, the arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30 000 students are already studying in such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strive to provide the best possible services for students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for higher education, careers and their role as global citizens.
In an education sector where there is the possibility to design and implement tailored school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to prove to be popular and sought-after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it gets to their head.
But if you speak in his language, it will reach his heart.
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that students from independent schools across the country scored the best in foreign languages.
68% of all students learning a foreign language achieved an A+ grade (a score of over 85%).
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of students achieved higher A grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved A grades.
These results also support the view that Scottish independent schools see foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages as electives have become at least as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in independent and non-independent schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission found that 17 per cent of employers said they had difficulties filling vacancies due to a lack of language skills.
This also shows that language skills are becoming increasingly essential for young people to pursue successful careers.
As more and more jobs expect foreign language skills, language skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, learning a foreign language is a lifelong learning experience that will bring you clear benefits.
Being able to communicate directly with people of other nationalities automatically gives a competitive advantage to a multilingual candidate.
According to a YouGov survey  of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013  75 percent of respondents were not fluent enough in any foreign language to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent (15 percent) of respondents.
That's why it's important to focus on language education for children now.
Knowing more than one language, especially in developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children to help them apply for more important jobs as adults.
In Scotland, every school will have a different language.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while more will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of major importance to the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child's interests, you will be able to study a range of languages at independent schools, and you will be trained by teachers who are experts in their fields.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment for children that prepares and equips them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is not difficult to see that in today's global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of a country, and education should reflect this.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated more as international communication skills.
Independent schools offer a choice, diverse and quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire  this is the way it has to be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is going to San Diego to play the Lakers on Sunday.
Fans who are sitting on a needle don't have to wait long to see LeBron James take the field for the first time in the LA Lakers' colors.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opener Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll spend on the court is questionable.
"More than one and less than 48", Walton wrote on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely only play for a limited time.
A few days ago, after practice, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the six-game preseason.
"At this point in my career, I don't need to play preseason to be ready", he replied.
Trump's West Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump will begin a long series of campaign events in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This will be the first of five Trump-sanctioned events next week, including stops in Tennessee and Mississippi that support him.
Now that the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat has been postponed, Trump is trying to rally support for the next midterm elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is in November.
When does Trump's West Virginia event start tonight, and where can you watch it online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 a.m. eastern time.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be watched online via YouTube live.
Trump is likely to be involved in this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been particularly tense in light of sexual harassment allegations, and the Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary purpose of the surge in events is to help the Republican cause ahead of the November election.
Trump's campaign adviser says the five events next week will be designed to activate voters and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their current majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.
"Having control of Congress is so critical to his political agenda that the president will be visiting as many states as possible, "a busy campaign period ahead", a campaign spokesman told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The event at the Wesbank Arena in Wheeling tonight is expected to draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and even make headlines in Pittsburgh, reports the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help his Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is not in a favorable position in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president needs to personally intervene to get better in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA battles full-shouldered against their Sunday opponent to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, Saturday afternoon's four-game series was a much-needed Ryder Cup.
The swing of luck and momentum is a pretty wild concept of sports, yet every player believes in it, especially in events like the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're down to four, so we can say we have the ball right now", Jordan Spieth said as he walked out at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe is still leading by four points and 12 more to go.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel like they've finally gotten a little bit of a head start and can take encouragement from a lot of things, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved infallible from the opening shot to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
Baylor's victory cries grew louder as he advanced through the circle, scoring a critical roll and equaling in Game 4, leaving him and Thomas double-tracked at two.
The game-winning roll on the 15th hole produced a similar cheer, the kind that would convince the viewer that the American team was not yet lost.
"You just have to dig deep and focus on your own game", Spieth said.
That's exactly what players are going to have to do.
18 holes for a chance to make your mark.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular couple in the Ryder Cup, have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's weird but adorable couple brought in four out of four, and they can't seem to go wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple not to perform above par on Saturday afternoon, and they performed similarly on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine stages of Friday morning.
Thanks to this series and the dynamic between them and the crowd that cheered them on, they became the benchmark for Sunday, and no one is more expected to ensure Europe's victory at Le Golf National at sunset than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing would be to win at different holes at the same time.
But it is too early to celebrate the European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly executed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foursome, while playing with Alex Noren.
The Spaniard and the Swede were once one and twice two strokes above par on the first nine holes, which pushed them into a swell they had no chance of getting out of.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Four-ball games and four-ball matches are extremely entertaining to watch up close, thanks to the interaction between the partners, and you can see who is giving what advice, what not, and how the strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is starting with a significant lead on the final day, but this quarter-final showed that the American team has the courage to fight, although many of them were missing, especially from the American side.
Europe starts the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead.
Europe has a good lead going into the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games ended with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The dynamic pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way, taking two victories over a failing Tiger Woods, bringing the gap to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team  who are trying to win back the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago  dominated the ever-erring American team in the morning four-ball games, winning the series 3-1.
The Americans put up a stronger fight in the fourth quarter, bringing in two games, but they couldn't even close the gap.
Jim Fury's team needs to score eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their opening four games.
After beating Woods' Patrick Reed in four balls, their team's excellent play beat the unmotivated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by a decisive 5 and 4.
Woods, who had two games of his own on Saturday, sometimes showed his talent, but he's lost 19 of his 29 games with four and four, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning fours, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and was defeated in the fours by 2 and 1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  the first and third in the world rankings  making a pair.
But Europe didn't make it on this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
With two points from three-time defending champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas on Saturday, he showed the Americans how to do it.
They scored a painful 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit in the individual competition, although a draw for defending champion Fury is enough to keep the trophy.
But after only being the second best for two days, a Sunday counterattack seems pretty unrealistic.
There's no way North Korea can disarm unilaterally if they don't trust their negotiating partner.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions only increased mistrust of the United States and that it was impossible for the country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Jongho told the World Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant and generous steps" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, closing a nuclear test site, and pledging not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
"Unfortunately, we're not seeing a similar response from the Americans", he said.
"We feel that the security of our nation is not assured, and that under the circumstances, we cannot unilaterally and first disarm".
While Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment that Washington opposes the idea of a full-scale nuclear disarmament, under which North Korea would be rewarded for its actions, his statement was significant because he did not explicitly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump guaranteed North Korea's integrity.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has not relented from the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"America insists on starting with nuclear disarmament and increasing the pressure with sanctions to impose its will on us, and also opposes declaring the end of the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of those who don't know us.
The problem is that the sanctions that are not eased only increase our suspicion.
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump was planned, but the US president specifically mentioned it at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed out that there had been three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, and added: If the country involved in denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this standstill.
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missiles were bound to hit the North American continent, after Trump called evil President Kim a missile man on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump -- who last year threatened total destruction of North Korea -- showered praise on Kim for his courageous steps toward denuclearization, but also noted that there was still much work to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea completed its nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said they didn't have a time limit, so whether it's two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for its actions so far.
In contrast, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: The Security Council sanctions must be strictly enforced until we achieve actual, final, demonstrable nuclear disarmament.
The Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rivi during the break of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go too well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced progress, but North Korea accused him hours later of making Gangster-like demands.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States took the necessary steps.
According to Mr. Mun, the "necessary steps" Kim mentioned would be security guarantees promised by Mr. Trump in Singapore and steps that could lead to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year encouraged students to get more sleep, in a bid to combat the increasingly masculine culture of caffeinated all-night study.
One scholar concluded that students at the world's top universities are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, which he says is the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a resident physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
She was inspired to develop the course by a previous talk she gave about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
And then one girl came up to me and said, "Why am I just now, as a senior, facing this?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which was surprising.
The course, which was launched for the first time this year, will teach students how good sleep habits have a fundamental impact on their academic and athletic performance, as well as a positive impact on their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health service, said the university decided to start the course because students were found to be extremely sleep-deprived during the week.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
One of them, for example, shows a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how insomnia affects sports performance, and why bedtime routines matter.
In another section, participants are shown how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus is shown with interactive icons to encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know we're not going to change the behavior of students right away.
But we think they have a right to know about it, just as they have a right to know about the health effects of smoking, said Professor Czeisler.
A culture that values the achievement of studying through the night continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures on students are causing insomnia to become a growing problem.
Getting enough and quality sleep is the students' secret weapon in the fight against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even protects them from becoming overweight, since sleep deprivation forces the brain into starvation mode and causes a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So helped design the course for Professor Czeisler, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemistry and biophysics who was first in his class at Harvard last year.
He said that those who heard him there opened his eyes and encouraged him to pursue a university-level education.
It hopes that as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to take part in a similar training programme before they are placed in the competitive sphere.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a bedtime warning, an alarm clock to wake them up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electric screens and LEDs, which can easily distract them from the daily rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston  Rangers 10: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb drove Steven Gerrard's team from a slide to a 1-0 loss in Livingston.
The Ivory Coast were looking to win their first away game since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat to Gary Holt in 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind defending Premiership champions Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers' unmotivated team was nowhere near even.
While the Rangers slipped to sixth place, Livingston grabbed third, trailing Hibernian by a mere goal difference.
The Rangers are also facing additional challenges after coastguard Calum Spence was hospitalized with a head injury from an object likely dropped from in front of guests.
Gerrard has also made eight points in a team that has been beaten by Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, took the Livingston field with the same 11 men who took a point off the Hearts last week, and he would have been happy to watch his perfectly formed team choke the opponent's game where it could have.
Although the Rangers led in possession, Livingston took more than he earned.
They could have scored in the first two minutes when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's goal, but the centre-half failed to sell the zigzag.
Keaghan Jacobs' low free kick landed on captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate, Alan Lithgow, only hit the side of the net.
The Rangers were in control, but they had more hope in their game in the third quarter than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty in the 15th minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were able to put up just two first-half shots, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's poor shot.
Although Livi's attempt in the 34th minute went against the flow of the match, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, not least because of their hard work.
The Rangers missed another Jacobs-forced zig-zag.
Scott Arfield failed to respond in time when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who found Menga perfectly for an easy finish.
Gerrard decided at halftime to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and that almost immediately took its toll on the game, when the extreme Morelos jumped, but Kelly, who was in impressive form, blocked in time.
Livingston continued to manage to play exactly the game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept the long balls one after the other.
Holt's team could have had a bigger lead in the final minutes, but McGregor took the net and hit Jacobs' position before Lithgow came at him from a corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton tried to fight another 11 when he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thompson was unable to convince him.
Almanach, inventor of the Geiger counter
A snippet from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that may have led to the invention of the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been a staple of science ever since, and it's also been made part of pop culture thanks to the 1950 movie, "Bells of Coronado", starring the quirky cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's the big deal?"
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter, and it can be used to search for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
If you put this headset on, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.
Listen, he's really bouncing right now.
Although Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to detect and kill abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
Part of the procedure involves extracting immune cells from the patient and then modifying them in a lab.
So they can see the protein that's associated with many types of cancer, and they inject the treated immune cells back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who received a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize abnormal cells may have had her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This involves removing immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory to detect a protein called HER2, which is a common side effect of many cancers, and then transplanting the cells back into the patient.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession".
HER2 promotes the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and anal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, which involves targeting immune cells and training them to attack cancer cells, has been used successfully in the past to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West's performance on SNL wearing a MAGA hat has culminated in a pro-Trump insulting tirade.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was fired from the Saturday Night Live studio after a rambling speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and then announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After he played his third song that night, "Ghost Town", in his Make America Great Again hat, he began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
A lot of times when I talk to someone who's white, they ask me, "How can you like Trump if he's a racist?"
If I was interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
Matt Damon opened SNL with a parody of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, a video of West's speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with the upload.
West even complained to the audience that he was being teased behind the scenes about his hat.
I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said not to go out in that hat.
You scared me!
And they said I was in the sunken place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see a sunken place? I'm going to take on my Superman cloak, because that means they can't tell me what to do.
Try love.
His remarks were accompanied by whistling from the audience at least twice, and the SNL cast were apparently embarrassed, according to a witness who told Variety:
West was asked to replace Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West raised questions when he performed his song "I Love It" dressed in Perrier glasses.
West was assured of his support by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, in a tweet:
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was just being himself, and that's great.
But I have decided NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or fashion items or by supporting their art) who I believe holds and promotes an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But we did it.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His rapper partner, Snoop Dogg, also adopted the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist, who was formerly known as Prince.

The defendant is due to appear in Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the DA's office.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, finds excessive masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, and in his HBO violent medieval fantasy series, he often wields a sword himself.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out against stereotypical male heroes, noting that seeing such heroes can often make little boys feel that hard work is needed to earn respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt something was wrong and asked how to address the problem of the harmful effects of excessive masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star, who recently married fellow actress Rose Leslie, also 31, said that he felt it was important to fix the problem.
"I am deeply affected by this case", the actor asked. "How did the portrayal of masculinity get so distorted?"
What did we teach men in their childhood about the problem we face now?
Kit says that television is also responsible for promoting a distorted view of masculinity, often with very masculine characters.
He continued his thought process, adding, "What is it that we are born with, and what is it that we learn?
What message do the streets and TV send to young boys that makes them feel that this is the only way to be a man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time and how we can change that.
Because it's obvious that there's something wrong with young men.
In an interview, Kit stated that after the series' summer finale, he would not appear in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel series because he was fed up with the battlefields and the horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, about a producer and his brother who live a life of robbery.
The actor said the best thing he's gotten from Game of Thrones is his wife, Rose, whom he met while making the show.
"I met my wife on the set, so I owe my future family and my life to the show", Kit said.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: New cases in China up by 14%
China reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS in the country has increased by 14%.
Health officials say that's more than 820,000 people affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by around 40 000.
A change from previously, the vast majority of newly infected people are sexually transmitted.
The disease had previously spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
However, health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said that the number of such cases had since dropped to almost zero.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 since the previous year.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very high ever since.
Estimates from various studies indicate that because of the country's conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
In many cases, the disease is spread in these relationships because of inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV medicines as part of a program to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that any of her staff members leaked the personal information of Republican senators and condemns the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that a member of her staff leaked the personal information of three Republican senators to the senators' Wikipedia page.
The Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles said the allegations were made by far-right experts and websites.
"Lying, lying and more vile lies", Waters tweeted.
The information released allegedly included the address and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unidentified source, but it was posted from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's sexual harassment case.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have linked the source IP address to Waters' office and shared information about a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reports.
"These accusations are completely baseless, false, and obviously lies", Waters continued.
 My staff member is not responsible for any leak of information, but his right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been violated by the fraudulent and false accusations.
These accusations are completely baseless, false, and obviously false.
Waters's comments were quickly met with criticism online, including by Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
"This is an angry denial", wrote Fleischer.
 Based on this, it appears that Waters does not have the temperament to be a congressman.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't react with anger.
He can't be defiant.
You can't question the prosecution's motives.
You need to stay calm and calm.
Fleischer likened Waters' reaction to what appeared to be a reaction to Democratic criticism from Judge Kavanaugh, who some critics said appeared too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is running as a Republican for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
If it's true, it's serious, he wrote in his message.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of the false allegations.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified  continued Waters  and that they are held legally accountable for any actions that endanger or harm any member of my staff. 
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's lame spy comedy
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in every British-related film, and the Johnny English action-adventure/parody franchise, the first part of which, Johnny English, was released in 2003, and the second, Johnny English Reloaded, in 2011.
Will the new export of the British nation be sarcastic, self-parodying satires in which we capitalize on our own obvious misery?
What is certain is that the eye-catching, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had ammunition enough to make another comeback. It is clear from his name that this comic character was created to be laughed at by the masses of theatregoers in non-English-speaking countries around the world.
Johnny English, of course, is a crazy secret agent who imagines himself as a conqueror with his bizarre mannerisms, so he reminds me a little of Inspector Clouseau, occasionally Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who contributed a single keystroke to the opening theme song for Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international traveller who Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, and who left a trail of chaos behind.
There are a couple of good moments in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English dressed in medieval armor approached a helicopter, and then the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comic vein is well established in the film, but the humor of the film doesn't really work, and it's even superfluous, because today franchises with a serious tone like the James Bond films or the Mission Impossible series are boldly using the humor.
I feel like the humor in the movie is more aimed at kids, and to me, Johnny English's flimsy, ill-fated adventures don't match the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings to the silent scenes of Mr. Bean.
The film starts with the eternal premise that Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal hacked into the British spy network's top-secret online network and revealed the identities of all British agents, much to the horror of the on-call agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got one such small role in the film.
This may be the final nail in the coffin of a smug and divisive prime minister whose political popularity is already in tatters: Emma Thompson basically plays Theresa May, and she brings out everything in an otherwise poorly written character.
Intelligence advisers outline to him that since the identities of all active agents have been revealed, he should put a retired agent on the job.
This retired agent, of course, is none other than two-handed Johnny English, who has been teaching at a top school since his retirement, but outside of the classroom, he teaches kids to spy.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where he is reunited with his former, long-suffering gunfighter, Bough, now played by Ben Miller, for emergency briefing.
Bough has since married, and she's married to a submarine captain who's always got his mouth full. Vicki Pepperdine plays the captain, who's better suited for roles that are far better.
So the two-handed pair of Batman and Robin from Her Majesty's National Security Service are back in action, pitted against Ophelia Bullet, played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, a true woman of destiny.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly being targeted by a charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be the solution to Britain's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: they set fire to a fancy French restaurant disguised as waiters, then, amidst an incredible uproar, they sneak onto Volta's luxury yacht, while English actually unleashes hell as he tries to explore Volta's apartment using a VR headset.
These are the stops we need to get to the end, but as fun and twisted as it is, it's a little too much like a children's movie.
The end result is pretty mediocre.
As with all the other Johnny English films, I wondered if the British film industry could finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talents.
The British Labour Party denies introducing a four-day workweek while paying British workers five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan to introduce a four-day workweek, all by making workers work for five days' pay.
The party is reportedly seeking to extend the benefits of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving executives extra days off to help them earn more money.
The plan would give workers three days a week, while taking home the same amount as before.
Sources say the idea would fit in with the party's economic program, which aims to shift the balance of power in the country to the workers' side.
The idea of a four-day workweek is also supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, who believe that workers can benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, the four-day workweek is an idea that fits well with the Party's programme to shift the balance of power towards workers in the economy and also fits into the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, the Green Party campaigned for a four-day work week in the 2017 general election.
The idea, however, does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: The four-day workweek is not part of the policies supported by the party and is not even on the agenda.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at a Labour Party conference last week.
McDonnell said he's fighting hard to take back power from the corrupt directors and the profiteers of the companies.
If the shadow finance minister's plans were to come to fruition, the water companies' shareholders would not be able to recoup their full profits, as a pro-worker government would impose tax deductions as punishment for what it considers harmful activities.
McDonnell further confirmed that he planned to include workers on the board and to establish Inclusive Ownership Funds that would pool 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees, who would receive 500 major dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have revealed on 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh will lead to the final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination at least a week later than originally scheduled, and the question is whether the outcome of the investigation will unnerve Republican lawmakers enough to not support Kavanaugh.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I said that before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke, after the charges came in, and I asked him what he did.
His answer was firm and clear.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be a sure thing.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take some extremely serious charges to make me change my mind", Graham said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett has vehemently denied the allegations that Graham made to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford substantiated the allegations.
It's a 36-year story.
I don't think anything new is coming out.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it been successful in reducing poverty?
Saturday marks the start of the annual Global Citizen Festival in New York City, where world stars will perform to champion a truly noble cause: the global eradication of poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is expected to draw tens of thousands of people to the Great Central Park Grandstand, where participants will not only enjoy a performance by Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the event's real purpose: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first organized in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project, a project run by an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by engaging more people in the active fight against poverty.
The concert is free for anyone (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who undertakes a task or activity such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a leading politician, making a phone call or any other meaningful activity to raise awareness of the project's goal: to eradicate poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen really been in achieving its goals over the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective way to reward people with concert tickets to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of what's called click activism where people feel they've made a meaningful contribution to a cause by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million actions have been taken by project sponsors, serving a wide range of purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have helped world leaders to allocate $37 billion toward policies and commitments to combat poverty, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has made 390 commitments and announcements claiming to be derived from its actions, of which $10 billion has already been paid or raised through fundraising.
The group estimates that the money raised has already directly affected the lives of nearly 649 million people.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and entrepreneurs to help children reach their potential.The organisation pledged $35 million to help end hunger in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put social injustice and malnutrition in the footnotes of history", said Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition ambassador to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after more than 5000 actions have been taken to call on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and their children, the government has allocated funds to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website is: Why do you think extreme poverty can be eradicated?
Global Citizen responds: It's going to be a long and difficult road, where we're going to get stuck and sometimes we're going to fail.
But like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will achieve our goals because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will also perform at this year's New York event, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman hosting.
Home Secretary: US Navy would use blockade to block Russian energy exports
"If necessary, Washington would even deploy the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, so that Russian energy could not reach the Middle East", US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke was quoted as saying by the Washington Examiner.
According to Zinke, Russia's active presence in Syria  in particular, as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government  is merely an excuse for Russia to gain new energy markets.
"I think they're only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe", Zinke said in a statement.
And the Home Secretary says there are ways to stop the Russians.
"The United States can use its navy to keep the sea lanes open and blockade them if necessary, so that Russian energy can't get into the markets", Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organised by the nonprofit group called the Consumer Energy Alliance, which defines itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, noting that they were practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be economically sanctioned in much the same way: by using existing energy sources and introducing new ones", Zinke said, while calling Russia a "one-dimensional economy", pointing to the country's dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby driving Russia out of a market that offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
So senior Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are persuading Germany to back down from the misguided pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which, if implemented, would make Germany a Moscow hotspot.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington is so vehemently opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
I assume we share the same view that energy should not be used for pressure and that consumers should be given the freedom to choose their suppliers  Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans' attempt to persuade the Germans backed down, as Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Confederation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and to stay out of bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
I consider it a problem when a third country interferes in our energy affairs  said Dieter Kempf, President of the Confederation of German Industry (BDI) after the recent meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is seriously considering running for president in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that after the midterm elections she's seriously considering running for president.
Warren in Massachusetts, at a town meeting in Holyoke, confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix a government that's broken, and it's time for a woman to be president", Warren said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm seriously considering running for president.
At the town meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump, saying he thought he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am watching with grave concern what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", Warren said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, "Well, of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's Massachusetts voters don't think Warren should run for president in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Analysis Center and Boston Globe poll, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren said he should not run for president until he is elected.
Thirty-two percent of them support Warren's candidacy.
The poll found that the majority of respondents, 38% would support former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy for President, and 48% would oppose him.
The 2020 presidential election has also seen the rise of high-profile Democratic politicians, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to an Associated Press report, Biden will have until January to decide whether to run.
Sarah Palin Track Palin referred to her PTSD at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, served in Iraq for a year after volunteering in September.
He was arrested Monday night on domestic violence charges.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he came home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming home with", Sarah Palin told an audience at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, hosted by Donald Trump.
He called Palin's son's arrest the elephant in the room, and said his son, like all war veterans, came back changed and hardened, and constantly wondering if he had the respect that his fellow soldiers, pilots and all other members of the military, had for their country.
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, and Dan Bennett, a Wasilla police spokesman, said that Track Palin was also reportedly drunk and carrying a weapon.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 states and Washington D.C. support a judicial review of the new U.S. asylum policy that prohibits asylum for those fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different states and Washington, D.C., wrote an expert letter Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy in court, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been released.
The plaintiff claims that she was abused by her partner and the sons of a violent gang, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
Prosecutors in the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as the source of many asylum claims to the United States because of the ongoing problems of gang and domestic violence in those countries.
The new U.S. refugee policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum while fleeing domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
Under federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed in the light of the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates that principle  stated in the expert letter.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that anti-immigration policies are harmful to the U.S. economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and fill the lowest-level jobs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered asylum judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is for people who leave their country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion  said Sessions when announcing the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was not invented to solve all the problems people around the world face every day, no matter how serious they are.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, death toll doubled, rescue teams race against time
The situation of the survivors is becoming increasingly hopeless.
Everyone is very tense says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she calms her feverish son at an evacuation center in disaster-stricken Palu.
Paramedics are bringing bodies in every minute.
We barely have drinking water.
Some residents returned to their destroyed homes to salvage what was still salvageable from the flooded property.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, are unable to provide care.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, were taken to the front of the military hospital in Palui.
Tears filled the man's eyes as he recalled the devastating quake that hit the hotel room on the fifth floor where he and his wife and daughter were staying.
There was no time to run.
I think I was trapped between the walls that fell", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of spreading propaganda against the country
The U.S. Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press a week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade ties.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to an ad in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest-selling newspaper, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections.
Trump's accusations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election, some US officials told Reuters, mark a new phase in Washington's increasingly aggressive crackdown on China aimed at putting pressure on China.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their own countries through advertising, there is an intensifying trade war between Beijing and Washington, which has seen more and more tariffs on each other's imports.
According to US and Chinese experts, the tariffs imposed by the Chinese in response to the start of the trade war were aimed at exporting to states where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses because Iowa exports a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an op-ed column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is further taunting our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
The Chinese government is exploiting America's cherished tradition of free speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
 However, if you go to a newspaper store in Beijing, you will hardly find any critical articles. The Chinese press does not reflect the different, differing opinions of the Chinese people about the increasingly gloomy growth prospects of the Chinese economy, because the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.
Branstad added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to take down his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans could alienate women voters with the Kavanaugh scandal before the midterm elections.
Analysts say the backlash from many senior Republican politicians who are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of sexual harassment allegations could be a major setback, especially for women voters ahead of the midterm elections.
The case sparked a furor, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be retracted, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article for The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, proposed at the last minute by Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake, will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C.-based newspaper.
According to the Mic, Friday morning, some protesters in the Senate corridor chanted "November is coming!" because the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"There will be an incredible jump in democratic enthusiasm and motivation", said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
Many people say he was very tall before, and that's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among unsure suburban women voters and young people (18-29 years old) who, while not enthusiastic about the president, often do not go to the polls.
Analysts had speculated before Ford's public testimony that he would retaliate against Republicans if they continued to support Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, and Ford has since explained in detail why he accuses the Supreme Court nominee of sexual harassment.
"The Republican Party is on the wrong side of the law", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote and the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets appointed, but also about how the Republicans handled the case and how they handled Ford", said Guy Cecil, director of Democratic election aid Priorities USA.
But it seems that Americans are pretty divided on whether they believe the statement of Ford or Kavanaugh to be true.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents believed Ford's statement completely or somewhat, and 35% of Kavanaugh's respondents said the same.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed that Ford did.
Following Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the credibility of Ford's claims, as well as those of another Kavanaugh accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath a week ago before the Senate Judiciary Committee that when he was 17, Kavanaugh molested him while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when they were both at Yale.
The inventor of the world wide web would launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was to gain world domination.
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data warehouse, also known as POD.
This may include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all on the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal online repository is that the user can decide who can access his data.
The company calls this the exercise of the right of individuals to self-determination over data.
John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, said the company's job is to provide the resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few contracted developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren't asking Facebook and Google to introduce the technology that would completely change the business models of companies overnight.
We don't ask them for permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of Solidra's newly built network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
Berners-Lee has been a key opinion leader in recent months in debates over net neutrality.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm infinitely optimistic about the next era of the world wide web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann, a Victorian Baptist minister who served in World War I, honored
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victoria Cross is being honored in his hometown 100 years after his heroic actions in World War I.
The Venerable and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned the medal during the attack on Bellenglise and Lecourt on September 29, 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he never knew he had earned the highest decoration in the British armed forces.
A memorial stone in his honour was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was symbolic that the monument was dedicated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's deed.
According to the London Gazette, the Reverend and Colonel Bernard Vann led his flagship through the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, amidst thick fog and heavy artillery and machine gun fire.
Later, he rushed to the front line and led the battalion with exceptional heroism, then single-handedly attacked a camp artillery detachment, killing three of its members.
The Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
"I know I can never match what my grandfather accomplished, and it taught me humility", said 72-year-old Michael Vann of his grandfather.
After a performance by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the cornerstone.
Michael Vann said he was honoured to have played a part in the ceremony, adding: "The true hero's heroism is shown by how many people pay their respects to him later".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 broadcast, and instead got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night watching the exciting Bellator 206 and the broadcast is off.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, six of which were broadcast live as part of the main competition night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, to the surprise of the English audience, Peppa Pig was brought on the show instead of the match.
This was a hardship for many who stayed up late because of the clash.
A kid's cartoon that was shot instead of an MMA match was captioned "Some kind of sick joke" by a fan on Twitter.
The channel can no longer broadcast this type of content at 6 a.m. under state regulations, so they have had to switch to children's programming said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of communications and marketing at Bellator for broadcasting.
Yes, it is Peppa, the pig's time.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, has promised to revamp the show's schedule in the future to take into account UK viewers.
"I think we can solve this by repeating it", Coker said.
 However, since it is 6 a.m. on Sunday, we cannot remedy the situation until Sunday, which is Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show went on, there were a lot of messages coming in, and most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But that's not what we were talking about. We were in a legal situation.
But I can promise you that next time, nothing like this will happen.
We're only going to have five games instead of six. We really wanted to make the fans happy, but we're done.
It was an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex because of his sexual orientation.
Tom Daley, an Olympic long jumper, said that when he was young, he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says that it wasn't until high school that he realized that almost everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he told presenter Lauren Laverne that he was standing up for gay rights to give others hope in space.
She added that since she became a mother, she's been less interested in the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has been out for months due to illness.
On his first show at Laverne, Daley, who was a guest on "Shipwrecked", said that as a young man he felt inferior to everyone else because it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, the feeling of inferiority and being different is what gives me the strength and perseverance to achieve my successes.
He wanted to prove he was worth something so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation was exposed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist in show jumping has become a well-known LGBT community figure, using her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge governments around the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live his life openly, without negative consequences, and to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said she was completely surprised when she fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she first met in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar-winning screenwriter, who is 20 years his senior, married last year, and he claims that age difference has never been an issue between them.
"If you go through so much at a young age", he said, "you had your first Olympics at 14 and your father died of cancer three years later", "it's hard to find someone your own age who has gone through such extreme experiences".
The couple adopted a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself admits that this completely changed his outlook on the world.
"If you asked me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win a gold medal", he said.
But you know what I've realized, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The baby was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was if he had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't answer him, "Dad, you're not gonna be in the front row anymore", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment I couldn't accept that my father wasn't invulnerable", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
I felt that this was what I had dreamed of all my life, to jump in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", she said.
The song Heather Small Proud helped her prepare for the Olympics, and to this day, it still makes her go wild.
The Desert Island Discs will begin at 11:15 local time on Sunday on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of shape and on the sidelines Saturday night at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson has a record-setting 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he'll need to get back in shape if he doesn't want this milestone to be a painful experience.
Mickelson is playing in a record 12th appearance at the biennial event, but his performance in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games has sent him to the bench by team captain Jim Fury.
Instead of being the center of attention when a player wins five major tournaments, as he has so often been when the United States has to fight for victory, he now spends half the day cheering for his team, the other half practicing on the court, and trying to correct mistakes that weaken his game.
Even at the peak of his career, he was never one of the most accurate hitters, so the 48-year-old is not exactly suited to the cramped circuit of Le Golf National, where the high grass pays a heavy price for mistakes.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the accurate England champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth game, who has won all four of his games this week with Tommy Fleetwood as the starter.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in their 12 individual games, get off to a strong start, then Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk claims he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
"He's fully aware of the role he played in shaping today, and he patted me on the back, hugged me, and promised me he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
She's extremely confident.
He's one of the greats, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and this past week.
I didn't plan on him playing two games.
I had more planned, but in the circumstances, we decided this was the best solution.
He wants to be on the field like everyone else.
Mickelson's performance on Sunday will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
This puts him in a position to close a Ryder Cup series that is far short of his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk stressed that the presence of the veteran player also brings intangible benefits to the team.
"Humorous, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with others, great team player", she explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed the games against him, and it's good to see.
His presence is beyond the game in the strict sense.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows that they can easily lose their gained advantage
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone gets a significant lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, the odds are easy to go against them.
The Dane made his debut in a 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, and then managed to hold on to a hairline advantage to win by 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"We must always remember that although we had a big lead at Valderrama, we still won by a hair's breadth, and we had a big lead at Brookline, where we were eventually knocked out", said Bjørn in the photo after the Class of 2018's 53rd victory on Friday and yesterday, giving them a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
If you think about the previous years, you can see that the game is not over.
You're gonna have to play hard tomorrow.
So let's go and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we need to focus on right now.
As I said before, I'm mostly focused on the 12 players on our team, but we also have to look at the other side, who happen to be some of the greatest players in the world.
Proud of the team's performance on a difficult track, Bjørn added: "I would never make predictions in this situation.
Tomorrow's a whole different cake.
Then it's all about individual performance, which is completely different from team play.
It's a great feeling to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you're playing alone, you're showing what kind of golfer you really are in every way.
That's what you need to get across to the players so they can get the best out of themselves on the court tomorrow.
They're gonna have to break up with their partner, who's gonna have to be at his best.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury, the captain of the opposing team, expresses confidence that his players will perform better individually than in pairs, except for the pair of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk has personally experienced both sides of the last-day resurgence: he was on the winning team in Brookline and then on the losing side after the European team's stunning performance in what has been dubbed the Miracle of Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he replied when asked about how he encouraged the players on the last day of Ben Crenshaw's 1999 team.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we're looking at a fast start, like we saw in Brookline, like we saw in Medina.
If one team gets really high, it puts a lot of pressure on the other team in the middle of the game.
We've put the order together accordingly and trained our players to perform a real miracle tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with leading the effort to reverse the position, and plays against Rory McIlroy in the first match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
I also chose the order because I think that's how the picture is from start to finish, which is what Bjørn added to the individual lineup.
The delivery of Germany's newest warship has been delayed again.
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially rising costs, it has been delayed until at least next year.
The commissioning of the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, the Rheinland-Pfalz, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper quoted an army spokesman as saying.
The ship was originally planned to join the Navy in 2014, but the continuing delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
The Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in 2007 to replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
We know it will carry a high-powered cannon and be equipped with a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-sea missiles and cloaking technology, including a signal attenuator that reduces the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it requires less maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the project's continuing delays may mean that these high-tech warships, with which Germany could show its power overseas, will be obsolete by the time they are finally put into service, noted Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to its manufacturer.
Not much information has been released on the reasons for the repatriation, but the German media have reported several critical software and hardware flaws that render the warship unusable in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as the Baden-Württemberg class warships will only have 120 seamen, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship is extremely overweight, which impairs its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further modifications later.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships commissioned by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the faulty parts, the increasing total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the project has already cost a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared with the initial project's estimated cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the new frigates are particularly significant in light of warnings that Germany's naval presence is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's national defence committee, recently admitted that the navy was running out of warships in working condition.
The official said the problem had become a self-defeating process, as the old ships had to be scrapped but there were no more ships to replace the ones that had been scrapped.
It expressed concern that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had yet been able to join the Navy's line.
The National Trust is researching the secret lives of bats
New research is underway at a Scottish Highland farm to find out how bats exploit the landscape for hunting.
The researchers hope that the results will provide new information about the behavior of unique flying mammals that could be useful for future conservation initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will study the behaviour of the common and soprano dwarf, as well as the brown long-eared and the water bat at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at appropriate points in the area to record the activity of bats during the season.
And NHS staff and volunteers will be using handheld detectors to collect mobile data.
By analyzing the audio in detail, the frequency of the bats' sounds can be determined and what species is doing.
Researchers also produce habitat maps and reports that provide detailed information on how animals behave in the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are the most important for bats and how the species uses them.
This information helps to identify the beneficial effects of habitat management activities, such as the creation of grasslands, and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past century.
Construction and land development disrupt the animals' sleeping places and reduce their habitat.
Wind turbines and street lights are also a risk factor for them, as are flypaper, certain chemicals used in building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually completely blind.
However, because they are nocturnal predators, they rely more on their hearing than on their eyesight when hunting.
Their sophisticated ultrasound technology allows them to determine the exact location of insects and objects in their path.
The NTS, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes the bat issue very seriously.
They work with ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys and sleeping quarters and occasionally participate in rescue operations.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to property manager David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threeve is a great place for bats", he said.
There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that's necessary for a good living space.
But we still don't know a lot about bats, and with work here and in other areas like this, we can learn a lot about what they need to feel great.
He also stressed the importance of making sure that bat populations are present before any building is renovated, since the destruction of a single colony could result in the death of 400 females and young, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, and their destruction, harassment and degradation of their habitat is prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's representative for the Bat Conservation Trust, has also asked for help from the public.
He stated: We still know little about bats and have almost no information on the population status of most domestic species.
Ronaldo denies rape charges, lawyers file a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news" and believes others are using his name to get into the public eye.
The football player's lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which brought the charges.
The Portuguese international and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorca, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
The woman said the athlete paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, announced in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million fans that the news was "a lie".
No, no, no, no, no and no.
What they've been saying about me today is all lies... told to the camera by the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.
They want to use my name to get into the public eye.
It happens.
They want to be famous under my name, that's the life of public figures.
I'm a happy man and my life is fine", added the player with a smile.
The allegations, which have been described as "unacceptable" and "suspiciously invasion of privacy", Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, Reuters reports.
Christian Schertz's lawyer said the player will file a claim for damages for the moral damage he caused, in proportion to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went up to the athlete's suite, where the man allegedly raped her, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney's Office in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was 99% a good boy, except for the zero percent.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having sexual relations with the woman, but he believed it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and had a hospital report of his injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was "afraid of retaliation" and "of public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman now wants to rescind the agreement because the trauma of the incident in question continues to affect her.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer Italian giants Juve bought the player for €100 million.
Brexit: the UK will regret the loss of its car factories forever
The UK will regret it forever if it loses its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added: 'Toyota UK is concerned by the statement made to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the carmaker will be forced to temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker says a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses due to delays at the border.
The Burnaston plant for the Toyota Auris and Avensis produced 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the other Member States of the European Union.
"I see that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production stoppages at the plant", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Burnaston CEO.
Other car manufacturers operating in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concerns about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works.
BMW, for example, has said that it will close its Oxford Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The carmakers are most concerned about the risks to their supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is currently running on a timely basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, industry representatives say border disruptions could lead to production delays and parts shortages.
Toyota claims that its Derbyshire plant would be unable to stockpile enough parts for more than one day and should therefore cease production.
Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU, known as Chequers, is precisely designed to avoid delays in border controls.
We need an agreement.We want an agreement on the best possible terms, which not only brings us the benefits of our current successes, but also offers new opportunities, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
 Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers can confirm that we are in dire need of maintaining our supply chain, which is currently extremely successful.
Toyota could not say how long production would last, but warned that the cumulative costs could undermine the factory's competitiveness in the long run, which could eventually lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and now represents Unite, union members are increasingly worried: In my experience, the jobs that are lost at this time will never be recovered.
A government spokesman said: We have developed a clear and workable plan for the future EU relationship.
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, White House officials say.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump's high-profile meeting may be postponed for another week as the debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian influence in the election, possible ties between Trump advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
There's been speculation in Washington for months whether Trump will eventually fire the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
According to a New York Times report this month, Rosenstein was considering wiretapping the meeting to record his conversation with the president, and the question of whether the 25th Amendment would allow Trump to be removed.
Rosenstein has denied any wrongdoing.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, and there were rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then due to appear before the United Nations in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he was "very happy" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were also testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the crucial Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, paid a visit to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said, "We don't have a date yet, we could do it this week, but in light of the Supreme Court cases, I see some chance of another one week delay".
It will be soon, and I will, as always, notify the press.
But some journalists were skeptical of this statement, because Sanders had not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of press conferences was not due to a dislike of television reporters' sensationalist behavior, but because he added: "I'm not disputing the fact that they are indeed sensationalists".
He then hinted that more face-to-face meetings between Trump and the press would take place.
The president gives more Q&A interviews than any president before him, and he even added, without substantiating the claim, "We've looked at the numbers".
Press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, light years away, it's better than talking to me.
We've been trying to get this line up a lot, and we've had a lot of those in the last few weeks, so instead of the White House press corps, you can talk to the president of the United States in person.
Trump regularly answers reporters' questions when he leaves the White House, or attends public events, perhaps press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
But press conferences alone are rare.
Why, perhaps, can be inferred from what happened this week when the president produced an unusual and at times bizarre performance in New York before a gathering of reporters.
The Health Treasury Secretary wrote to NHS Scotland's EU staff about concerns over Brexit
The head of the health department wrote a letter expressing the country's gratitude to NHS Scotland's staff from European Union countries and stressing that he hoped they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's expected exit.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of settled applications for legal status for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service.
In his letter to Freeman, he wrote: The UK and EU continued to negotiate on their withdrawal over the summer, with a decision expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also started to prepare a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of how unsettling this must be for you.
I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of their country of origin.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries contribute valuable experience and expertise to the work of the Health Fund, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we would love to have you stay with us.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He walked to the shore and just collapsed", Reed said.
The coaching staff and medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the end of the course, then placed him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
An official at Tennessee State in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a reporter for WSMV, that Abercrombie is beyond surgery, which was performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he was not aware of any further details regarding the type and extent of the injury at this time while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, the year-old sophomore on a break, is in his first season with Tennessee State, where he transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five successful fitting-outs before leaving the track, making him 18th overall this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher tax on property purchased in the UK
Under the new Tory scheme, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on property purchased in the UK, and the extra income would be used to support the homeless
This move would neutralize Corbyn's success among young voters.
The tax increase is aimed at non-UK taxpayers
The Treasury estimates that this would generate £120 million a year in income for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes on property purchased in the UK, with the surplus proceeds going to help the homeless, Theresa May is set to announce at a press conference today.
The move is likely to offset Jeremy Corbyn's successes among young voters, which he has achieved with his promise of more affordable housing and measures targeting high-income earners.
The tax increase will affect individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and the surplus revenue will be used to fight homelessness.
The additional charge on top of the current charge, which may be as high as 3% in addition to the higher charge on second homes or real estate purchased for expenditure purposes two years ago.
The Treasury expects the measure to generate annual revenues of GBP 120 million.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, causing a significant increase in prices which makes it increasingly difficult for first time home buyers.
Many of the country's affluent districts have become ghost towns, especially in the capital, with many foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people who are waiting for their first home.
He personally blames the big construction companies for keeping property prices high, who have become accustomed to buying up land and leaving it to dry up, and he has asked May to remove quotas on affordable housing and do something about the country's housing market disgrace.
Corbyn has announced a series of remarkable proposals for housing reform, including rent control and the end of evictions without good reason.
It would also give the councils more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said I wanted to devote my premiership to restoring the British dream and making life better for each generation.
And that requires a real estate market adjustment.
Britain remains, as ever, open to anyone who wants to live, work and raise a family here.
However, it is not right that individuals living outside the country and companies with foreign interests should be able to buy property as easily as hardworking British citizens.
The dream of having a home has become almost unattainable for too many, and the shame of homelessness has become too accessible.
Jack Ross: "My greatest wish is to be the manager of the Scottish team".
Jack Ross, Sunderland manager, has said his greatest ambition is to manage the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would be keen to take on the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in the Premier League, just three points behind first place.
He then moved his headquarters to the Stadium of Light after successfully guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League the previous season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
Unfortunately, I was only able to get into the reserves", Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
When I was a kid, I used to watch a lot of Scotland games in Hampden with my dad, and something always drew me back to them.
But now I have a chance to succeed as a club manager.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager is not worried about following in the footsteps of such big names and has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My measure of success right now is whether I can get this team back to the top of the division.
If you look at the structure and the facilities of the club, there's no doubt that it's a top-flight club.
It won't be easy to get back, but it's more than likely that I'll only consider my work here a success if I can get the club back.
Ross's managerial career began just three years ago, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Aolla recover from relegation to the Third Division and won the championship the following season with St Mirren on the verge of relegation.
Ross claims he feels more confident now than he has ever felt in his playing career, whether at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real defining moment", he recalled his time as Alloa's coach.
I clearly thought that managing was more for me than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I did well, I made a pretty good living out of it, and I actually had some really memorable moments.
But sometimes the life of a gambler is very hard.
There's a lot to go through every blessed week.
I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of my job, but I have to handle the management.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've gotten a taste of it, I feel like I'm in my best shape as an adult.
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, from 12:00 to 1:00 local time on Radio Scotland.
One study found that Saturday afternoon, 5:30 a.m., is the time of year for beer.
The summer heat wave has seen a significant increase in traffic in struggling pubs in England, but the pressure on restaurant chains is still high.
According to the data collected, the revenues of pubs and bars increased by 2,7% in July, while those of restaurants decreased by 4,8%.
Peter Martin, from the business consultancy CGA, which compiles the statistics, said: Thanks to the sunny season and England's longer than expected World Cup appearance, July continued the trend of the previous month, when pubs saw a 2.8% increase in revenue, with the difference that restaurants saw an even greater decline.
The decrease in restaurant revenues of 1,8% in June worsened further in July.
The best performers were pubs and bars, which were mainly alcohol-based and produced higher growth rates than even restaurants.
Pubs that served food were also affected by the prolonged sun, although not nearly as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems people are more into drinking at this time.
The revenue from drinks in company-run pubs and bars rose by 6.6% this month, while food revenue fell by 3%.
According to Paul Newman, an RSM analyst in the leisure and hospitality industry, "These results follow a trend that has been emerging since the end of April.
The weather and major community and sporting events continue to be the main revenue generators for the entertainment and hospitality industry.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains are in a difficult situation and an annual revenue decline of 4.8% may be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant operators, and it will only be a matter of time before the more moderate weather experienced in August brings relief in this area.
The overall revenue growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, which also reflects the slow pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales of the UK catering sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is a widely accepted industry benchmark, collects and analyses performance data from a group of 47 operators with a total turnover of over 9 billion tonnes.
One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents
One survey found that one in five children (as young as 11) has a social media account that he keeps hidden from his parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows that the number of Insta pages is growing
News of increased fear of sharing sexual content
20% of the students said they had a principal's account that their parents could see.
One in five children (as young as 11) has a social media account that is hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in the number of Insta subscribers, which is a reference to Instagram's photo-sharing site.
The news has increased fears of sharing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a spotless main account that their parents could see, but they also created private accounts.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenage profile that said "rape me".
According to research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having private accounts.
"I find it disturbing that so many teenagers feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them", said HMC CEO Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletic Association.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and the chairman of the sport's governing body, Ian Beattie, said the vast international experience gained by the sport over the past decade would be invaluable to decision-makers.
Eilidh is held in high regard in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and his presence will help to develop Scottish athletics  said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I am delighted to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really help the work of Scottish sports leaders.'
The BBC's regular expert on American athletes won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, but he was forced to use a wheelchair because of a temporary brain disorder.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would be a matter of time before I could recover.
I've had a tough job, but I've made a full recovery, I can walk again, and I'm going to agility training today.
Thank you for all the encouraging messages.
Breastfeeding ads that liken mothers to cows divide the online community
A breast-feeding company's ad that compared breast-feeding mothers to calves has caused a heated debate online.
Elvie claimed to have developed the world's first silent, wearable vacuum cleaner, and their product was advertised in an ironic ad that quoted music videos that showed the freedom the device gives mothers who are weaning.
Four real mothers are dancing in a cowshed full of straw, while the lyrics in the background are: "Yes, I'm getting my head together, I don't even have a cock yet" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't flowers, these are my breasts".
And the chorus goes, "I pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, all of all of all of all of all of it's all of it
The ad on the company's Facebook page quickly became a hot topic of online debate.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments with mixed reactions, many of whom say the ad is a mockery of the dairy industry's horrors.
To advertise the product with very tasteless cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only when they give birth to offspring, but their calves are taken away within days", recalls one writer.

Another commented: "Yes, terrible for the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell vacuum cleaners to mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added, "A totally insensitive ad".
Others defended the ad, one woman admitted that she thought the video was a bit funny.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it right away if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a stupid commercial, so I'm not gonna try to see it again.
The product is brilliant.
Another writer said: "It's a funny ad for mothers who are weaning at work or in a toilet, and they feel like they're being weaned.
It's not the dairy industry that's praising or condemning it.
At the end of the video, the women show us that they were wearing their breast pumps all the time while they were dancing.
The campaign is based on the perception that women who use vacuum cleaners sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, uses no wires and tubes, and can be placed discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, so women can move freely, holding their baby, or even moving out while sucking.
According to Ana Balarin, co-owner and communications director of Mother, "The Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By drawing parallels between women who are weaning and cows we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using suckers and to show in a funny way how free our suckers are.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner has been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked onto the runway wearing a Marta Jakubowski dress while using the product.
Hundreds of child migrants were smuggled into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of child migrants in detention has reached a record high, while the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies to date that have made it harder to find homes for them.
The hosts are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that their chances of staying in the country would be jeopardized if they applied to take in the children.
This threat was further heightened in June when it was announced that adoptive parents and adults living in the same household would be required to take fingerprints and share this information with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the chief of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in testimony before Congress last week that dozens of people have been arrested for accepting unaccompanied minors.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had criminal records.
80% of applicants and their household members are in the country illegally and a significant number are convicted criminals.
That's why we're continuing to search for such individuals", Albence said.
In order to speed up proceedings involving children, new rules have been introduced that require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained instead of the previous 60 days, social workers say.
Many people report to court via videoconference instead of appearing in person to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge doesn't give legal protection, the immigrant will be deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer the detention period, the more anxious and depressed the children become, and the greater the likelihood of violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates say that these risks are only heightened by a larger facility like the gymnasium, where the number of children makes it harder to screen out those in need of psychological care.
They added that not giving children enough time to prepare or to say goodbye to friends before moving to such a facility exposes them to even more trauma.
Syria has called on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to leave immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the country's eight-year civil war.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces had entered Syria illegally on the grounds of fighting terrorism and would be treated as such.
"You must leave immediately and unconditionally", he told the General Assembly.
Moualem argued that the war on terrorism in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, will soon end.
He stated that Damascus would continue its holy struggle to cleanse all Syrian territory of terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
There are 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, most of them training and advising Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent over 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem argued that the conditions were right for their return and that only some Western countries were instigating irrational fears to deter refugees from returning home.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help the population return home he said.
They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned against providing reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a conflict zone around the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a full-scale offensive against the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set clear deadlines and expressed his hope that military action would only be directed against jihadists, including the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which must be eradicated.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes a committee of government and opposition representatives to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare for elections can be convened soon.
The Council also welcomed the Commission's decision to extend the mandate of the Syrian Government to the Council of Europe.
That's why they're gonna re-elect Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless the hopes of many liberal viewers are realized and an impeachment trial or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
We can be sure this will be the most dramatic presidential final ever.
But for now, the audience is enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time viewership has nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show is the most-watched cable show with 3.5 million viewers on the nights of major news days.
"It attracts us like fire because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's drama series "The Designated Survivor", in which a low-ranking cabinet minister sits in the president's chair after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different view.
This is what a Boston taxi ride before the 2016 election says:
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked him why.
"Because it makes you laugh", the driver replied.
That's the fun of chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the stability of the global economy.
Only a very small minority can ignore these facts.
But that's no longer part of responsible reporting when you're watching a sixth hour of a video about the authenticity of the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward's book Fear, or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (the Washington Post's version of an arrogant costume in disguise), or the implications of Stormy Daniels' description of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
As for me, from now on, that's what I'm gonna remember about Super Mario.
"It feels a little like watching a reality show where you get something new every night", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Mortgage Stars.

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, sunny day on Kaua'i, and he was still in his house, watching MSNBC, recording CNN.
He couldn't take his eyes off the TV as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing began in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where the very future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows, a lot of people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization", Fleiss recalled.
I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.

Both parties are pouring money into the closest race in the midterm congressional election.
No one was surprised that in Pennsylvania's 17th District, both parties are spending money at a loss after a redistricting of congressional districts saw two active lawmakers battle for the same seat.
One of the contenders for the newly redrawn Pittsburgh suburb is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in a midterm election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently the representative for Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which has significant overlap with the current 17th district.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous district charts had been manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th District, the two-party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), nearly bid against each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after he narrowly won the high-profile March midterm election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The House seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, with Donald Trump winning the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts say the Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for its support of China, but then abandoned the plan.
Diplomats say the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, to which Washington has barely responded.
Donald Trump held a good-natured meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners forced the Trump Organization's leadership team out.
The State Department has recalled key U.S. officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over their recent decision not to support Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received approximately US$140 million in US aid in 2017, including in the form of counter-narcotics, development and economic assistance.
The proposed punitive measures, such as reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have had a severe impact on the Central American country, which also has a very high unemployment and murder rate.
As the closed-door meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which was to be a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, and whose primary objective was to reduce migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which made it clear that they did not intend to punish El Salvador.
It's been announced that Vice President Mike Pence will be speaking at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which diplomats say is a clear sign of how important the administration considers the event.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington issued no condemnation statements or implemented any punitive measures.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was reported anonymously by three US officials, including two diplomats.
Their accounts were backed up by external analysts close to the administration, who also declined to be named.
Historical experience
The next blow could be a report from special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice in any way... as many of the facts in the press indicate.
Mueller's investigation allegedly includes whether the Trump team collaborated with Russia to try to influence the election.
If the Democrats get a majority in Congress, they'll certainly try to hold Trump accountable, who, after the voters, may face the judgment of his fellow politicians.
We can see that there are many uncertainties and Trump's fall is far from inevitable... as is his European counterpart.
Big decisions have to be made on both sides of the Atlantic... depending on how long the fight goes on.
In 1938, many German officers were ready to overthrow Hitler, just waiting for the West to side with the Czechs in Munich.
The aid was withheld, and the bloodshed of the following years could not be prevented.
It is at such historical turning points that the inevitable development of democracy either accelerates or slows down.
In America today, we can identify many of these turning points.
What are we gonna do when Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as the Mueller investigation's lead investigator?
Rosenstein's chair has been vacant since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested that his conversations with the president be recorded, suggesting that Trump was unfit to hold office.
Rosenstein said The Times was inaccurate in its reporting.
How will we respond if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is biased or incomplete and you are appointed to the Supreme Court despite a seemingly credible sexual harassment allegation?
And the most important question is, in the midterm elections, are we going to vote for a Congress that's willing to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy faces a long winter.
I trust that will not happen, especially given my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that used to sit in the building that was my ambassador's residence.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she asked me to light candles on the swastika table on the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?

Rangers forward Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Wien.
Rangers will host Rapid Wien on Thursday, and a win over the Austrians after a surprise draw against Villarreal Spain could secure them a place in Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans has been sidelined with a knee injury until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but feels that the Rangers can build on this result to score bolder goals.
"It was a great point against Villarreal", said the 31-year-old.
We believed we could score a point, and we did.
Maybe we could have scored another goal at the end, but we can't complain about a draw.
They were better in the first half, and we got to him in the second half.
Thursday's game is another big European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy because they were pretty good in their last game, but with our fans behind us, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was a tough one, I was injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We've got a good team, the guys are enjoying the game, the training is going well.
I hope that if we give our all, we can put the past season behind us and achieve good results.
Many women worry that they are not saving enough for retirement
The respondents had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted in their old age, but only a small percentage talked about it with their family members.
According to a Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents have discussed with their spouse the expected costs of their care in old age.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don't bring it up", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
Here's what you should do.
First, discuss this with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to care for you properly if you do not tell them in time what your needs are.
Choose where and how you want to receive care, together with your counselor and family, and these decisions will have a significant impact on future costs.
Involve a financial adviser: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can be done with a traditional policy designed to provide retirement care, or with a hybrid life insurance combined with savings that can cover expenses or use your own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources.
Prepare legal documents to cut off the possibility of a lawsuit.
Trust a representative, a trusted person, to act on your behalf in health matters, to supervise your medical care, and to make sure that everything goes according to your expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
You should also entrust someone with your finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and makes sure that the bills are paid when you are unable to do so.
Remember the little details too: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about your medications and allergies?

A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he was walking home from his evening program.
The victim, in his 40s, was attacked in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, with gunshot wounds to the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting at about 2:30 a.m. local time as an accidental act.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening.
Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and authorities say the death toll could rise.
The area's communications network was also damaged, so there was no news from Donggala governorate north of Palu, where the 7.5-magnitude quake was centered.
More than 16,000 residents of Palu had to be evacuated.
Some key facts about Palus and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes Province, located on the west coast of Celebes Island at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and a tsunami hit.
Donggala Governorate extends over 300 km along the northwest coast of Celebes Island.
The population of the governorate  of the administrative region smaller than the province  in 2017 was approximately 299 200 inhabitants.
Central Celebes is mainly characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important economic sector, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the Celebes coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit by flash floods many times in the past 100 years.
A flood in 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a flood hit West Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes are frequent.
Just a few of the major earthquakes and tidal waves of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake struck off the western coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that reached 14 countries, claiming a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half of the victims dying in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, near Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and resulting tsunami killed nearly 700 on the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake devastates near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shakes an island in the Mentawai Archipelago near Sumatra, causing 10-meter-high (about 33-foot-high) lava flows in some places, destroying dozens of villages and killing some 300 people.
2016: A near-surface earthquake hits Aceh Pidie Jaya Governorate, causing panic and destruction that reminded many of the terrible flood of 2004.
No tidal surge this time, but still more than 100 residents died under collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok, a popular tourist island in Indonesia, was hit by a massive earthquake that killed 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were razed to the ground, and thousands of tourists were stranded on the island for a time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on a charge of assault.
Palin, 29, lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest, Alaska State Police said.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su prison on $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and when asked about his guilt, he said he was not guilty at all.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
You're also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been in trouble with the law.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged assault to the police.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstruction of justice, as well as possession of a firearm while under the influence of alcohol, in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was also criticized by several veterans' organizations in 2016 when she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck on Friday on the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a flood that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and telecommunications systems have been compromised, and the death toll is likely to rise in the coming days.
The epicenter was near Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Several videos of the arrival of the floodwaters have been posted on social media.
On Palu Beach, hundreds of people gathered for a celebration when a tidal wave hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors have asked for the death penalty for the suspect in the New York City terror attack.
New York state prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the deadly terror attack in New York City that has not carried out an execution in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of rushing a truck rented from Home Depot into a bicycle lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway in October, killing several pedestrians and cyclists.
To establish the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight of his victims and intentionally injured them, according to a filing with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.
According to the file, the evidence of either of these charges could be used to justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 offences, including eight counts of murder for extortion, which had until then been used almost exclusively against organised crime, and damaging and destroying motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and deliberate intent", prosecutors claim, and Saipov was described as having carried it out in a "simple, cruel, inhuman" manner.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.  The complaint states that the family of the deceased was not in a position to provide information about the deaths of the deceased.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has been seeking the death penalty for a defendant for over a decade.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal death sentence in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he took pleasure in what he did.
Saipov said that ISIS videos he was watching on his phone gave him the idea for the attack, according to the indictment.
Police say he asked to have an ISIS flag displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said he was understandably disappointed by the prosecutors' decision.
"In our opinion, the actual life sentence for confession would have been more favorable, "and the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all involved in the case",
Saipov's defense team has asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for their client.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage at a protest at the Tory conference said he was calling for a people's army to fight.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the pressure of Euroscepticism after a Theresa May supporter suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiating with the EU.
Non-official Conservative Peter Bone told the Birmingham gathering that the UK would have left a long time ago if Farage had been Brexit minister.
It's a good indication of the pressure within the party that is against May that the Tories have spoken out at another anti-Brexit rally in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which calls for a permanent rift between Brexit and Remain and the EU.
His allies say he's trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, so that the Eurosceptics and Labour can only choose between his package or total chaos.
At a Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull, Bone said the Chequers deal must be cancelled.
He suggested that Farage be elevated to the House of Lords and entrusted with negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was leading the negotiations, we would have left already", he declared.
The Wellingborough MP added: I stand by Brexit, but the Chequers deal must be paid for.
Criticising the EU, he said: "We did not fight the world wars to be servants of others.
We want to make laws for our own country.
Bone rejected the suggestion that public sentiment had changed since the 2016 vote: "There is no basis for believing that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay".
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory MP who was also present at the meeting, told reporters: "All I ask is that you listen to the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote, the party membership is unpopular, and especially among the activists who work in the field and helped us get into government.
Forget about the Chequers deal and listen to us.
He added in a keynote address to May: Only a Prime Minister who keeps his word can keep his seat.
Farage told the rally that politicians must feel the pressure not to reveal the results of the 2016 referendum.
The trust between us, between the people and our politicians, is now at stake.
They want to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell you that we will not allow them to do so.
He told the enthusiastic crowd: "I wish our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit would feel the pressure.
We are calling on the people's army to fight to win Brexit and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom independent, self-governing, proud again.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched in Birmingham and held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved the flag of the anti-Brexit movement, which was formed over the weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis has been in the way of the Conservatives' use of the party's staff due to security flaws at the opening of the conference.
These people said they had the IT background to a Canada-plus-plus deal, to a smooth border crossing and a borderless free trade agreement with Ireland.
They're just talking about it.
There is simply no good Brexit   stressed.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election, she will seriously consider running for president.
According to a report in the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future Saturday at a community forum in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is up for re-election in November against state Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's been speculation for some time that he might be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was part of the 36th Citizens' Forum with voters since Trump took office.
One of the contestants asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to play a role in Washington in the removal of the failed government, including holding the top positions.
The person suspected of shooting LSU quarterback Sims has been arrested.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time today the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
They've released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the gunshot wound, which proved fatal", Police Captain Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to a report by 247sports.
Wayde's friend stepped in to protect him, that's when he shot Simpson.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene, had a gun, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest was made without incident, and the man was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge and is 6'2" tall, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to the world title after team instructions saw him win against Sebastian Vettel
After Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a big part in the race.
Bottas, starting from pole position, had a good start and almost got Hamilton into trouble, as he defended his position on the first two laps, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, Vettel went into the ring and let Hamilton get stuck in traffic behind the midfield, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a close action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inner arc after moving twice in defence in turn three.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the starting grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap.
He then led for most of the race, as he did not change tyres to get to the finish quickly and overtake Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of fourth place.
He finally entered the ring on lap 44, but could not improve his pace on the remaining eight laps, so Räikkönen finished fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was ordered to leave.
The team has done an exceptional job to secure the top two spots", said Hamilton.
His body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday after the senator insisted she didn't leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, only noted that what was happening in the Senate proved that people are disgusting, hateful and liars.
"What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see that people are angry, mean, hateful and lying", he said.
If you look at the statements and the leaks, they say, "Oh, well, that wasn't me".
That wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't leak it.
Well, let's stop for a second.
No, we didn't leak it. He did it in imitation of the senator.
The letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent by Ford to Feinstein in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's claims, nor did I leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
You asked me to keep it confidential, and I did as you asked.
However, his denial seems to have been rejected by the president, who remarked at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what: his body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual harassment by three women by claiming that the Democrats were using the alleged charges for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They see the vile, the vile, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control", the president was quoted as saying by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against the Belfast Giants 5 to 3.
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee
With a 5-3 win Saturday in Dundee, the Dundee Stars avenged their defeat to the Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League game.
With Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants had an early two-goal lead.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home run, after which Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled Dundee's deficit, and then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals ensured their victory.
Adam Keefe's players have won their third Elite League title this season, beating Dundee 2-1 at the back of the grid on Friday night in Belfast.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's opening goal in the fourth quarter came at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's goal line, and then four minutes later, with the help of David Rutherford, Beauvillier doubled their lead.
In the turbulent opening third, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 1:10 before Matt Marquardt's pass tied Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead into the half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first third.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard again tied with a man-to-man advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's combined play helped Nielsen take the lead for Dundee towards the end of the second third of the match for the first time, and then ensured the win with his team's fifth goal in the last third.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are headed home to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A pilot lost his life to save hundreds of people on the plane from the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero who lost his life trying to get a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area, and many people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing with their lives at their disposal, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly wobbling control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
It remained there to allow Batik Air flight 6321 to take off safely, which was already on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
We were very sad to hear about all that he had done for us.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, with the country's disaster management agency saying Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are hard to reach.
"The death toll is likely to rise further as many people are trapped under the rubble and many have not been reached", said NGO spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high destroyed Palut, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Ambulances are bringing in more bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Small shops were looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a real tragedy, but it could be a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country's troops to: I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out the evacuation tasks!
Are you ready?  CNN report.
This year, Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes on Lombok Island, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one person is missing in a plane crash in the Laguna
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has announced that one person is missing, although it had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to an Air Niugini press release, as of Sunday afternoon, one male passenger is unaccounted for.
The airline says it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further information about the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline says six passengers remained in the hospital Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane missed its runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was flying very low.
"This is a terrible thing", Jaynes commented.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to plunge into waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered minor head injuries.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors working at a nearby wharf also helped rescue people and took them to shore in an inflatable boat before the plane sank 100 feet [30 m] into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them involving Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor introduced the defendant to the man on Saturday for a retrial accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an information analyst.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the woman's death.
Rowlett said he obtained location records from multiple phones that showed he was with Tellis Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that she knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
According to the cell phone records, they only knew each other a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"You wiped him out of your life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to be heard by a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
One hippo has been able to create a negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, hip-hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to those roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for firing her after a racist text.
A nanny in New York has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after the mother mistakenly sent her a text message complaining that they had hired another black nanny.
The couple denies being racist and liken the case to blackmail.
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when, on her first day of work in 2016, the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived and saw that she was black.
"My dear, you have slept again", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her failure, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable, fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for compensation for the dismissal and is seeking $350 a day in compensation for the six-month period of housework he was originally hired to do, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them how to stop the march, that's not something you can do", he told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know that's discrimination".
The couple responded to accusations of racism by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was reasonable because they feared they could no longer trust him after he had been abused.
My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist", the husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone who was even accidentally rude to you?
The newborn?
Come on, you know what?
Plasco likened the case to blackmail, saying his wife had just given birth to the baby two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you attack someone like that?
It's not a nice thing to do, the investment banker added.
While the legal proceedings were ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the party on social media, condemning their behavior and logic.
According to a letter found recently, the publisher of Paddington was afraid that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being in the position of someone who reads for the first time before it's published.
That's amusing enough information now that we know how huge a success Paddington is.
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book about a teddy bear, would not have resented being turned down for the job, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had been a bitter success after his father's death last year.
He called Paddington a very important member of the family and added that his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a very quiet man, he was not at all conceited", she said.
But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who carries something: we are proud of him even if we don't really have the credit.
I think that's how Paddington saw his success.
Although he created it and it was his imagination, he always credited Paddington with his success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, he and his daughter were rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain for his life.
Nad called regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that he was not expected to survive, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter was gonna die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly ran out and left his system.
He's been dead before, and that's when it all stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all over.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with others who did not care about the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", he said.
I was shaking my head and crying the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That she needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.
A poster with mourning women on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted postcards with inspirational messages and distress numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed, then committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook, and her smile was on everyone's face.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile would blow up any place.
However, he gave up his work before his death, as he was in very bad condition.
Tyler, who took his own life, was found by his brother, who was 11 at the time.
Ms. Davis said, "I was constantly worried that this was going to cause some kind of domino effect".
Ms. David designed the postcards with the purpose of letting people know that there are people they can visit and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit still. You have to talk.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of the man's mother.
She didn't say she was depressed or depressed or anything she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her attitude.
She was so upset on Christmas Day, when the kids were opening their presents, she wouldn't look them in the eye and stuff.
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it.
He broke our hearts to pieces.
But we must keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future in question as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could get what he asked for... a limited-time, limited-scale investigation... maybe we could reach an agreement", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid of falling apart... because of the party's indecision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance is solely due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans don't perform as expected, it's going to be much harder for them to get their man on the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush took the phone to call the senators and lobby them for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
The Senate is voting, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the decision to nominate Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean dissidents has decreased under Kim's rule.
The number of North Korean dissidents traveling to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengszok cited data from the Southern Unification Ministry and said that there were 1,127 dissidents last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the increased border security between North Korea and China and higher penalties for human traffickers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not commented on this information publicly.
Most of the North Korean dissidents eventually become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China accepts dissidents as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, focusing on stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came in June with a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in broad terms on further cooperation on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the Americans, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances it is inconceivable that we will unilaterally disarm", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical, unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claimed his behavior was not worthy of a Supreme Court job.
Pelosi said this in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"It occurred to me, unintentionally, that if a woman ever behaved like this, I would call her 'hysterical,'" she explained Pelosi's reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was protesting emotionally against rumors that he had sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and his voice was hoarse, when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also specifically condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated character assassination", organized by liberals angry about Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's behavior proved unfit for the Supreme Court job, showing a bias against Democrats.
I think he's excluded himself by his statements and the behavior he's shown against the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if he took office and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"All I'm saying is, if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only are you not fit to be on the Supreme Court, you're not fit to be on the court where you're sitting right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as Kavanugh is considered a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would overturn Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to sit in the courtroom and expect us to crack with joy", Pelosi declared.
And women have to hold it.
It's a legitimate rush, and it brings out the anger that you've been building up for months and years, and you can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's that rare, is it?
"I had a great help from a woman who worked in an executive position somewhere", she continued. "She told me that she cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique where when she started crying in anger, she would say to her partner, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm pissed off.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought, "That's a great idea".
Part of the reason they view tears as a sign of anger is that they have been fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my early work, in a male-dominated office, where one day I started crying in my rage and helplessness, was grabbed by the neck by an older woman -- a cold manager I was always afraid of -- and taken out to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad and be happy they've upset you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business ship and was eliminated from the race, Ms. Schroeder, in her deep frustration, figured there was no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and they wanted the new candidate in the middle of their back.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
With the campaign dragging on, Ms. Schroeder was behind schedule on the fundraiser, so she vowed not to compete unless she raised the $2 million.
It was a battle that was doomed from the start.
He found that some of his supporters had given the men $1,000, but he only received $250.
Did you think I was getting a discount? He thought.
When he held a press conference to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed with gratitude for the people who supported him, and frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and directly reach voters, and anger at sexism, that he had a sore throat.
"They may have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled the press reaction.
They must have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my headstone?
Did you cry?
How can a US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening lines of the U.S.-China trade war have been almost deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the break between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warnings earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation has occurred this week, as new tariffs are already affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has retaliated in every case, most recently imposing tariffs of between five and 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to fight back every time, and the world's second largest economy is certainly not going to back down anytime soon.
If you want to make Washington back down, that would mean you have to bow to the demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet experts say that if Beijing is well-tactical, U.S. trade war pressure could benefit China in the long run by reducing the dependency between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could send either country's economy into a financial whirlpool is far more serious than observers have previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher on Asia at the New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem claimed that the situation in the country was improving.
The current situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the achievements in the fight against terrorism  he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now, all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who were forced to flee due to terrorism and economic measures taken by the authorities that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state welcomes all assistance in the reconstruction of the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team by 16.5:10.5 at Le Gold National outside Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six straight in Europe and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended their championship title as Denmark's captain Thomas Bjørn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the American star player who struggled throughout the tournament, dropped his shot on the par-3 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari the win.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the world's greatest players, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have been in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the tournament's all-time leading European winner with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so very happy, I'm so happy to have won the trophy back.
It's all about the team and I'm happy to have helped", said Garcia, who is struggling with emotions after his European victory.
The relay is going to Jon Rahm who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2&1 singles.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, this man I grew up watching", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has struggled all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who have been excellent golfers throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the US team, team captain Jim Fury said he was proud of these guys for fighting.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
That's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're re-organizing our team, working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You're gonna have to put your hats on too.
The enemy was better than us".

The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in some areas of Tampa Bay.
FWC says more spotted blooms have been reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a decrease in concentration.
The red tide stretches roughly 130 miles of coastline from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
There are spots about 10 miles outside of Hillsborough County, but on a relatively small area compared to last week.
The red tide was also seen in Pasco County.
Last week, we had moderate concentrations in Pinellas County and coastal areas, low to high concentrations along the Hillsborough County coast, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations in Sarasota County and coastal areas, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in Lee County and coastal areas, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There have been continuing reports of respiratory irritation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation was reported from northwest Florida last week.
