This not only confirms the already popular theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details such as three-dimensional form and color that are not normally found in fossils.
Scientists say that the feathers of these animals have a chestnut brown color on the top and a light or carotenoid color on the bottom.
This discovery also sheds light on the evolution of the birds' feathers.
Although dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed rod called a plume, researchers speculate that plumes had other features - spines and pincers - that suggested that the plume was a later evolutionary development, like these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or signaling. Although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers suggest that the specimen shows the adult tortoise, not the younger, with a pair of snowy feathers.
Although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers note that the pattern indicates adult feathers, not the thin ones of a juvenile.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Milky Way.
The team is looking for the effect of the tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
The Moon exerts its power on the Earth, creating tidal forces, while the Milky Way exerts its power on the Milky Way.
Scientists were able to deduce that dark matter affects other dark matter in a similar way to ordinary matter.

Dr. Tony Mole Kwalu Natal, a South African, discovered a new strain of tuberculosis that is highly resistant to antibiotics.
The new variant "shows a very high mortality rate, which is very scary", he said in an interview.
Some of the patients may have been infected with the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll hypothesizes, and at least two of them are hospital health workers.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom they have had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB cases in the entire TB population still indicates a very low incidence; it is 6,000 out of 330,000 infected with the disease in South Africa at any given time.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters find themselves alone in a booth, leaving a pre-printed sheet in an envelope indicating their preferred candidate.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voters, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting roll.
French election law strictly requires the compiling of work reports.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been made transparent so that voters and observers can see at all times that no envelopes were inserted at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes were added except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process. In the evening, following special procedures, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision.

This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law operates differently and the publication of photographs is often viewed by courts as biased.
"It seems that the public release of photos of the suspects could create a dangerous situation for journalists", says Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee.
The Crown Prosecution Service has told reporters it will not release any statement, at least until indictment.
According to the leaked information, the document is related to the border conflict, which is what the Palestinians want to see in the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered included the future state of Jerusalem, sacred to both countries, and the crisis in the Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, and the PA has agreed to only allow that presence for five years.
Since the preliminary pest control test was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness, the shooters had to be closely monitored by the rangers.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot-out were given extensive safety training.
Martelli was sworn in by the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
As part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections, a presidential commission last month recommended the resignation of the former CEP.
The commission was Martelli's response to widespread protests against the regime in October.
Occasionally violent protests have been sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled for 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, including a total of six fires, resulting in four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 emergency incidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded to Apple's postponement of the report as "really tragic".
At 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m. GMT), the earthquake struck in Mariana.
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostage Hong Kong tourists after seizing their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took her place after an elderly woman needed to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered the medical profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the Leggins Hospital, she began researching premature births in her spare time.
His research showed that when given a hormone, the development of the fetal lungs was accelerated.
Xinhua reports that government investigators found two black box flight recordings on Wednesday.
Other wrestling heroes also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the queen of the hand, my first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. She was so unique, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Reynolds commented that Luna was as mysterious as me... perhaps even more so... that we loved her and missed her... and that she was in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposing Australia becoming a republic have risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled are of the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Empress of Australia.
At the close of the poll, 29% of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the Commonwealth Games in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three in the relay, but he claims his fitness is questionable.
The drugs he needs to relieve his pain have been banned from the Olympics, and he can't take them.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever discovered.
In early February, several people using various hardware and software confirmed the discovery, which was published on Tuesday.
The Earth may have been supplied by the comet with water and organic matter that could produce proteins that support life.
Scientists believe that the collision of a comet with the earth long ago has provided new clues to the formation of planets, especially the earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political ambivalence and stupidity".
He invested heavily in the 2016 presidential campaign.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that reduces carbon emissions by enabling aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the old ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to identify the aircraft with greater accuracy and provide more accurate information to the pilots.
There is no additional transportation and the above ground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking facilities in the suburb and no public transportation.
Fears of lack of transportation prompted the team to close the gates of the competition without sponsors.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species has evolved over two generations. Due to previously interbreeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortress, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza coronariostris, it is believed that this process will take much longer than that.
Gold can be turned into almost any shape, and it can be rolled into an umbrella.
It can be made into a thin wire that can be ground and knitted, and it can be crushed and wrapped into sheets.
It was so thin that it could be pasted onto other metals. So thin was it that the so-called "light manuscripts", sometimes hand-painted pictures, were used to decorate books.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The colour of the juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is the amount of hydrogen in the test chemical (the H in pH).
The hydrogen ion is the proton that has lost its electron (because the hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Glue the dry powder together, and then with clean, wet hands, crush it into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a pleasant and create a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home has a flush toilet connected to a modern sewer system.
The remains of the sewerage systems of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Baths also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were mixed together.
When you're talking to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call, and then it bounces back down very quickly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space to see the world, since the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, you'd need a giant rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it has done for us is provide easier and faster transportation.
It has given us the train, the automobile, and many other modes of transportation.
They come down from rabbits to antelopes and foxes, medium-sized predators, medium-sized cats.
Finally, there are many small cats that eat small predators such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds (including the pet cat that lives in the wild).
The secret to their success is the concept of the unique function that each cat has in keeping each other from competing with others.
The most sociable of all cats are lions, who live in large herds known as a flock.
The Prides are made up of one to three related adult males and about 30 wild females and their young.
As sisters and daughters of a single family, females are usually closely related to each other.
Lion Prides act in a manner remarkably similar to a wolf or a pack of dogs (but not other large cats) and are very lethal to their prey in behavior.
A well-formed athlete, the tiger is able to climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, the panther class, and is the only one of the four that has the ability to grow a roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full roar of a lion, but like a phrase made up of roaring, roaring words.
The American cat prefers to eat small animals, including monkeys, snakes, mice, and birds, although most of the other predators are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that American cats hunt for prey by following its trail and identifying its location on the ground by its scent.
They have excellent night vision, and they are also able to move about in stealthy slow motion. American cats blend in with their surroundings, hunting their prey and jumping on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (e.g., when they cross a mountain range or a river, or when they arrive on a new island from which they cannot easily return) they often face a different environment than they have ever experienced before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will need other features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they were before.
The original population has hardly changed, and they still require the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new species begin to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look more and more different from the other species.
Eventually, thousands or millions of years from now, the two will look so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this speciation, the creation of new species. Species is an inevitable consequence, a very important part of evolution.
The plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which we exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they provide shade.
Plants are what we use to build our homes and clothing, and many of the things we eat are plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mesoosaurus was the top predator of its day, fearing nothing but another Mesoosaurus.
Its jaws are equipped with more than 70 sharp, pointed teeth and an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, so that no one who is caught by it can escape.
We don't know yet, but it may have had a divided tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mesozauruses, and it may have been a natural predator.
It attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex could not resist it.
While many of their foods are familiar to us, the Romans had their own peculiar or unusual eating habits, including wild boars, raccoons, porcupines, and the mice known as domus.
The other thing was that the poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to have a banquet and eat side by side.
The ancient Roman diet may not have included foods that were introduced to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted dark meat.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, and it was considered the house of the gods.
While offering sacrifices to the gods, the priests sought to satisfy the gods through rituals and ceremonies.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by the priests.
Perhaps the temples were built as part of a special pyramidal column called a cigaret.
The top of the tower was a sacred shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was of little use.
The Jewish family spent much time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops had only open windows facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not rich in forests, so the price of wood was very high.
Human habitations in Greenland were very rare. In Norse folklore, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for a murder, and to have found Greenland and named it Greenland on his further journey westward.
But whatever his discovery, Eskimo tribes were still living there at the time.
Although each of these lands was 'Scandinavian,' the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you'd think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. The document may have written something on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence read "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down on the back of the document.
No one knows who wrote it, but it is known that in its early days this large parchment (it must have been 29 3/4 by 24 1/2 inches in size) was rolled up for storage.
So it is possible that the marking was merely a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, but not the south.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans, instead of fighting the invaders, working with them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, in what became known as Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a society of a considerable number of people living and working together, enjoying a single culture.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, civis, meaning citizens, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and thus refers to the size of society.
A civilized culture is meant to carry knowledge, a lasting cultural footprint and fair publicity across generations.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
Thirteen states joined during the Revolutionary War to form the first weak central government with a unified state constitution - the only component of which was Congress.
Without a national executive or a court, Congress had no power to tax and had to rely on federal authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
It had no power to override the laws of the interstate and the customs duties.
Amendments to the Constitution required the unanimous approval of all the states, as the Constitution requires, and the states, as relieved as the central government was, often did not send their representatives.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing are among the most popular sports.
Italians compete in international sports and Olympic events, and winter sports are most popular in the northern regions.
Japan is made up of some 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the clusters of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "island nation".
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when it was reported by European navigators passing through as Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company, based in southwestern Taiwan, transformed indigenous grain production practices by employing Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Convention, which ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this is still going on.
For example, the world's most widely used still image photography format is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size during the era of analog film.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio is inherited by digital camera image sensor models.
The 35mm model is actually a bit of a mess, measuring 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
So the aspect ratio of this model (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Most common models (for example, the APS family models) are similar to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often-ridiculed rule of three is a simple guide to maintaining the order of measurement in an image and creating dynamics.
It states that the optimal location of the main object is the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into three parts. (See example).
The Catholic Church, rich and powerful, was sorely tested during this period of European history.
Despite the differences in language and customs, European states have been bound together by Christianity for over a thousand years.
Its power extended from the king to the common man.
One of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to eradicate poverty and oppression, and that the church's financial resources exist for that very purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and questions have been raised as to whether this concentration of power and money fulfills that teaching.
As hostilities mounted, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy of cutting off essential military and civilian supplies has proved effective despite the fact that it violates generally accepted international law, as established by a number of international treaties over the past two centuries.
To prevent ships from reaching that entire part of the sea, the British bombed international waters, making it dangerous for ordinary ships.
Since this tactic had a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
Pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of many citizens and nations in the 1920s.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of World War I, the nations were willing to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla came to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the A.J. with his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachiller to Thomas Edison (his manager at his previous job) and 4 cents.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking time; each stage or dynasty in China was a distinct dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
The wars between the various dynasties that fought for the throne were fierce during this period.
The Three Kingdoms was the bloodiest era in ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the top seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are a number of social and political influences, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
And after the revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most promising and successful individuals to succeed.
The same was true of the military, since the rank of the army was based on skill, not class.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond the worldly life. He used to go to a mountain called "Hira" called "Nur" (Light) to grow his crops.
The long-standing tradition gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on a single hilltop north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if one knows it exists, it is not easy to find, and once inside the cave, it is completely isolated.
The clear, beautiful sky above and the mountains at the edge of the lake are all that is visible.
The only remaining of the Seven Wonders is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many structures built to honor the heavenly Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Cemetery", in Egypt's Death Valley, is home to several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several smaller tombs, burial mounds, and a sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, while the other smaller pyramids, tombs, and mausoleums were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upper bow" looks like a V, and the "lower bow" looks like a square or a triangle.
Going up means you start at the top of the bow and push the arrow, and going down means you start at the bottom of the bow and pull the arrow (where you are holding the bow).
An upper bow generally produces a soft sound, while a lower bow is stronger and more distinct.
Keep pencil notes as you wish, but remember that printed punctuation marks have a musical purpose, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, and their two young children, 11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles, and the king's sister, Elizabeth, were sent to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789 by a group of market women.
They rode in a carriage back to Paris amid a mob of angry men, who shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows.
On one occasion, a member of the mob offered the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles to the Queen.
The conquest of the Philippines was brought about by the burden of American imperialism, by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government through Wall Street banks, which were responsible for paying a large share of the interest and expenses on Philippine government bonds.
Indeed, the excess revenues generated by the exploitation of the Filipino people for a time were among the primary benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the impulse to create the Order was accelerated.
The time of these events is generally considered to be the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of the High Middle Ages in European history (1000-1300 AD).
The Upper Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and the Post-Middle Ages, which ended around 1500 CE.
Technical determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from a technical impulse or technological necessity to a strong sense that the destiny of man is governed by a scientific law and its underlying logic and its expression by technology.
Many definitions of technological positivism share two common concepts: that technological progress goes far beyond cultural and political influence, and that technology has "impact" on socially disadvantaged societies rather than on socially disadvantaged ones.
For example, one might say that the automobile is the inevitable cause of road development.
However, it is not economically feasible to have a nationwide road network for only a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The large-scale car ownership is creating a risk of increased accidents on the roads, and it is causing new approaches to health care to repair damaged parts.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural criteria, derived from writers like Goethe, Fitch and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these were more suited to fit the place of the society than arbitrarily imposed rules.
Just as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
The city's decline began in the 12th century, mainly because of the return of the Crusaders, who brought back gifts of silk and spices that were worth more than the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was during this time that the name of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Between the 10th and 11th centuries, and again in the 14th century, the Gothic tradition reached its peak.
Early on, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the Western style can be slow for 25 to 30 years.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the greatest developments of the period was the introduction of buttons to the crusaders' sleeves.
Dependent agriculture is the practice of farming to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Dependent agriculture is a simple, often organic, method of crop rotation or other relatively simple crop-growing techniques combined with the use of seeds indigenous to the ecoregion.
Farmers have been farmers since ancient times, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who are ignored by social norms and allow them to build an identity.
Subcultures may be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture different may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often signal their membership in specific and symbolic ways through designs, rituals, and dialects.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on children who have experienced a series of unfortunate events in their adult life, such as being inappropriately socialized, neglected, unfortunately or intentionally abused.
Such children are called "violent" or "disciplined". Some violent children are "con" by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, severe intellectual or physical disabilities may be the reason for the parents' rejection of a child.
These violent children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Some are alleged to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully adopted by non-human animals, undisciplined children (within physical limits) display the same fear or distinction toward humans as the protected animal.
Project-based learning, which should make learning easy and fun, goes a step beyond the scaffold.
Support is not a method of learning, but a support to those who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of a scaffold, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolding is internalised within the software and is intended to question, interrogate and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and bribery.
The Bible says: "The inexperienced have their own reward and the stupid have their share of the shame". (Proverbs 16:20) The Bible says that "the wise in heart are the ones that will inherit the earth, and the earth will indeed be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah".
We see the dedicated care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our system of assisted living is meant to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Dedicated care is providing all the necessities that were not available in their former home.
The Internet combines both the elements of large-scale and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and access.
For example, 'learning' and 'society' are suggested as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Imee and McCord (1998) identified "personal connection" and "continuous connection" as new motivational scenarios when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions and facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, correctly interpreting micro-indices can test whether a person is lying.
In his "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks explains how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately assess honesty.
He suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century revealed two pools of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variants.
With each generation, the variability of back and forth movement and recombination between the two reservoirs changes.
Outside of the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans would find it difficult to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
And failure to do so has dire consequences: growth stress, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins in the leaves and the flaxseed, which would otherwise be difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, roach, eggs) are high in digestible fats, which are high in protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees in the savannahs today.
Sleep disruption is the deliberate awakening during your normal sleep time and going to sleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a sonic alarm clock to remind you to come without waking you up completely.
If you reset your sleep clock, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which may force someone to get up to urinate.
The inner peace of a person is opposite and related to the level of stress in a person's body and soul.
A lower level of stress makes the survival of the life force more positive, and each individual is able to find total peace and contentment.
Each individual can find a way to achieve this goal, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is largely based on the Mahayana path of love and the techniques of Indian yoga.
The Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundali yoga, meditation and the all-embracing way of love.
Khandalini Yoga is a practice of awakening the Khandalini energy (the energy of the senses) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is on the goddess of yoga, and through the sight of various deities, the pathways of energy flow are purified, the chakras are activated, and the enlightened awaken to liberation.
In the spirit of cooperation between the USSR and the USA, Germany was a common enemy in World War II. As the war ended, clashes between systems, processes and cultures caused the states to split.
More than two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it was fought by proxy armies, in fact, in places from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many more.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to reorganize the retreating Romanian enclave.
"In any case, after the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland in violation of the Treaty of Non-Invasion of Poland, the Riga Peace Treaty and other international agreements, including bilateral and multilateral, the Soviet Union's plans were all but shattered almost overnight when the Red Army's force of over 800,000 men entered the country and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts".
Ships are the most efficient means of transporting people and goods in large quantities across the oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navigator is to enable the movement of people and goods in your country and, in the meantime, to interfere with the movement of people and goods of your enemy.
One of the most recent and notable examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and gold across the Atlantic to support the British.
At the same time, German sailors, mostly with the help of U-boats, tried to stop the traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Historical cultures and tribes began to keep them as a convenient source of milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds roaming the mountains or other pastures, often tended by children or young men, known as shepherds. These methods of tending are still used today.
England's wagon tracks were built as far back as the 16th century.
Although the rails were mostly parallel, the horses could pull them faster and could carry heavier loads on rough roads during the day.
Cross-linking was introduced to keep the line accurate, but gradually, it was realized that a steel bar on top of them would be more efficient.
This became a common practice, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the carts more expensive.
The first full-iron rails were introduced in 1767. The first railway in the world was built in 1767 to carry the railway line.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and with the emergence of Homo erectus, two million years ago, humans began to walk.
Their successors, the Australopithecus, were not accustomed to standing.
Although sahlanthropus may have walked seven million years ago, fossils of the Australopithecus dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago show that it used its legs.
We can start to live more environmentally conscious, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists, and we can contribute to some extent to reducing future suffering.
This is similar to the treatment of symptoms in many cases, however, unless we want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and disable it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been compounded by population growth and a way of life that exceeds man's size.
After it passed the Congress on July 4, a draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies of what is now called "Dunlap's Broadside" were processed overnight.
On July 8, the document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, one of them was sent to George Washington, who read it to his staff in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The oldest surviving copy of the document is Dunlap Broadside 25, the original manuscript has been lost.
Most paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Because they have wings and can fly, most people don't consider them dinosaurs.
But there are still many birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have hooves and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T. rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these binary numbers are called digits - or bits in computer grammar.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are common, making early diagnosis impossible.
The best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of a poisoned medicine container or a poisoned household chemical container.
Check the label for any first-aid instructions specific to a specific type of poison.
Entomologists use the word "dragon" in the formal sense of this group of insects.
The word comes from the bed bug, a type of insect that feeds on humans in the past.
Both the killer and the bedbug are suckers and have adapted to live in cages or the habitat of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), and it is considered the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, made up of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis.
A couple can decide whether adoption is in the best interests of the child and of themselves.
The couple may decide to plan the family for their child.
In adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights by allowing another couple to parent the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which in fact guides most scientific research.
But that's not all, experimentation is also involved, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing also provides a guide to the scientific method.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical text, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view of all things scientific, including psychology, was accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was seen to be detached from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms in physiology and behavior are often critically dependent on the existence of interstellar cycles and their production through biological clocks.
In many organisms, including bacteria, mice, plants and animals, rhythmic rhythms have been documented that are not simply responses to external rhythmic cues.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators and will continue in a freely-running cycle even without external cues.
One of the most important suggestions that DNA is genetic material was Hersh and Chase's experiment.
Hershey and Chase used the implant or virus to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, radiofosphorous labeling of bacterial yeast DNA or radiofosphorous sulfur labeling of bacterial yeast proteins.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a germline cell.
The genetic material is transferred to the baby, and the cells are then transferred to the mother's body.
Nature-based tourism attracts those who wish to visit natural areas, including flora and fauna, with the aim of enjoying beautiful scenery.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, gardening, and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, visiting the orangutans of Borneo, taking photographs and learning about them.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns to get into their cars and go to their workplaces, passing by others who are doing their jobs.
In this dynamic transportation cycle, everyone is connected in some way and supports a mode of transportation based on personal cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation, and almost everyone is charged with transportation.
In developed countries, such complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why is transportation so blamed, why does it fail daily, are transportation engineers so reckless, or is there something else?
The study of the movement of drivers and vehicles between two locations and their interaction with each other is called traffic flow.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably fixed range; thus, traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These links help in the planning, design and operation of the facilities.
The first animals to take to the air were insects, whose ability to fly enabled them to avoid predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range to hide from the killer whales.
The only insects that can't flap their wings are the bat and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many were opposed; they thought the solar system, the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't know that the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying eight times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on earth, sometimes six miles wide.
The Amazon provides 20 percent of the water that flows from the land through rivers to the sea.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the pyramids at Giza and the technical excellence of the construction never lost its importance.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marvel at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then thousands of years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the world's smallest and least populated country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its constitution and in official communication.
Italian is the language of daily life for many in the government, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Since gold, silver, and copper are naturally occurring in nature and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools, humans have known about such basic chemical compounds since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle taught that all matter is composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This most closely corresponds to the four states of matter (in that order) called matter, matter, air, and matter, and so he theorized that it would change into the new elements we see.
Alloy is basically a combination of two or more types of metal. Remember that there are a number of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic components like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are amazingly small, and there could be trillions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
So, for many people, the pencil was a good friend when it was first introduced.
Sadly, the pencil was degraded by the invention of other writing methods.
Now, people write messages on computer screens without even going near a pencil sharpener.
One might wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle of energy generated by the fusion of a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like driving a heavy cart up a mountain, and the nucleus splits again, releasing some of its energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break apart with little or no movement.
The moon's surface is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The nearest side of the surface is about 70 kilometers thick, and the farthest is 100 kilometers thick.
Under the flat areas of the Moon, it is thin and under the high ground, it is thick.
The thinner surface, the more tidal currents can be nearby, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Satisfaction theories focus on discovering what people like or are attracted to.
These theories suggest that humans have internalized certain needs and/or desires as they reach adulthood.
These theories ask what motivates certain people to act and what they do or do not do, and how their surroundings affect them.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are two popular content theories.
In general, managers may have two behaviors emerge when they lead their former colleagues: one extreme of that spectrum tends to be "one of the colleagues".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance appraisals, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a group can become an unidentifiable entity that has the ability to change everything that's been going on and make it its own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leader and the rest of the group.
Electronic teams have the same standard of excellence, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members will always act as the point of contact for their nearest physical team.
Because their teams can assemble in different time zones that are not understood by their local management, they often have more autonomy than a traditional team member.
The presence of a true "invisible group" (Larson and Lafusteau, 1989, p109) is another distinguishing feature of a virtual group.
The "invisible team" is the management team, whose members report to all the members. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization need to go through the process of establishing a long-term learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional areas of an organization, creativity and innovation can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can move to a new innovation process that serves the needs of the consumer.
A culture of leadership innovation as well as shared knowledge and corporate learning must be created before an organization can be modernized.
Angel (2006) describes the Santé approach as a method used to achieve higher levels of performance in an organization.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating consciousness, thus narrowing the field of research and making the research more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as concussions, injuries, and tumors, can affect behavior and cause some changes in mental function.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to investigate and see the brain's structures and processes in unprecedented ways.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create visualization models that help us understand the workings of our minds.
Artificial intelligence is a major branch of computer science that deals with the design, behavior, learning, and processing of computer systems that have strong science fiction characteristics.
AI-related research is concerned with enabling machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples include the ability to respond to customer error judgments and questions, as well as the ability to control and design handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become other disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is built into several home computer and video game applications, and is now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher likes to take her students on a bus trip to places that are not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or create fine artwork while sitting with the class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to share the experience of a field trip with future classes.
For example, every year, students at North Carolina's Bennett School create a website about their trip to the state's capital, and every year the website is recreated, but an older version is kept online for use as a field book.
Blogs can also improve students' writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with lazy grammar and spelling, and audience attendance usually changes that.
Since students are the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to be intelligent about the world around them". It encourages students to be intelligent and curious in order to present according to the needs of the audience (Toto, 2004)
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can encourage students to be more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online material, students can define their own position within the context of others' writings and articulate their own perspectives on specific issues" (O'Rourke, 2002).
The beautiful bilingual capital, Ottawa, Canada, is lined with a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south is the Niagara Falls, to the north is Muscooka and beyond, in the exquisite natural beauty.
All of these and more features highlight Ontario as a place of Canadian origin considered by outsiders to be of great importance.
The northernmost areas of the Great Lakes have very rare populations, and some are uninhabited forest.
To the surprise of many, a demographic comparison: more African Americans live in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of these, and in terms of wildlife, it is a continent.
The majority of the smaller islands are united with either independent nations or France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
Islam was introduced to the Arab world, and it was mostly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Regardless of marital celibacy, it is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married.
And a ring (often a ring of protection) helps.
Women need to understand that what is perceived as harassment can be caused by cultural differences, and that being followed, being dragged, and so on are not uncommon.
Be more assertive in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's not acceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Meranids as a strategic port called Afna.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese and rebuilt as Casa Branca, only to be abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar-u-Badiya, and Spanish merchants established their trading headquarters there, giving it the name of Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in Morocco.
Although it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as tajine, pottery, leather goods, hooks, and the gigaw stalls scattered throughout the area around the old Medina, all of them are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano erupted, and the lava flowed into Goma, burning most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, the situation of conflict in the northern province needs to be investigated to understand the situation of the people living outside Goma.
The city is the starting point for the ascent of Mount Nyiragongo, and is one of the cheapest mountain gorilla destinations in Africa.
To get around Goa, you can use the Bodas-Bodas (motorized taxis). The average (local) fare for a short trip is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
With its relative difficulty of access, the "timbuctoo" has come to be used as a metaphor for the unfamiliar, remote terrain.
Timbuktu, a city with an airport and tourist attraction, has become a city of poverty.
Due to the threat of its desert sand, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990.
It was one of the main stops of Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city has an Arabic feel rather than an African one, making it look almost completely different from other cities in the country.
The Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Kimbu River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecoregions that provide a variety of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the main one of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Almost all South African national parks have daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
One can also benefit from purchasing a wildcard to access selected parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction of many tourists.
The skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a map of the glowing points visible from the water level of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is built on land that has been reclaimed from the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists took their own, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest marine reef system, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladesh and Indian subcontinents.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian mainland is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forest is not just the swampy marshes of the canyon - it is also the remnants of the great forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 sq. km, of which one-third is covered by water/gravel.
Since 1966, Sunderbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and now has an estimated population of around 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted monkeys.
Buses going mainly east and towards Jhajjar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30, but throughout the day buses depart from the inter-district bus stop (across the river).
Since buses between districts are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by convenient and robust mini-Japanese coaster buses.
Shared taxis are quick and comfortable ways to travel to nearby places such as Faro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Umbu River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the cities of Umbu, Brazil, and Saint Georges de la Umbu, French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the two lanes are 3.50 meters wide, and the length is 378 meters.
The bridge has a horizontal clearance of 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it will not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, just in time for the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaraná were the most important indigenous group inhabiting eastern Paraguay, engaged in subsistence agriculture and living as semi-nomadic hunters.
The Chaco region was home to indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly known as the "Province of the Indies", Paraguay was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish invaders and native groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous nature and identity.
Argentina is famous for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held on the polo fields of Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
For news and tickets to tournaments for polo competitions, check with Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands that can exchange currency is the one opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley often accepts credit cards and American dollars.
In remote islands, British and US currency are available, but credit cards may not be accepted; check with owners before making decisions on which payment method is acceptable.
Falkland currency exchange is not possible outside the islands, so make sure you exchange before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer when the Northern Hemisphere winters, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, where temperatures of over 30 degrees Celsius are common in the summer months.
Winters can be unusually cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make them colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no seasons of "rain" and "dry": the amount of precipitation is constant throughout the year.
Although the animals in the park are familiar with the sight of humans, wildlife is the life of the wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife.
As fierce as they may seem, the bison, the bull, the moose, the mouse, the bear, and every other large animal can strike you in the leg.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured by not keeping the proper distance. These animals are large, aggressive and often ferocious, so they must be given the space they need.
Additionally, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking any smelly food and remember to keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Avaija, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of a fierce naval battle in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British warship sank, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the liberation struggle organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful reunification of the city ended with the assassination of the last ruler, Tupua Tamase, Lialofi III.
Because of its location between two harbors, Auckland has many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Sea Coast (North Harbor District) is located on the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost entirely sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many of them are shaded by the Papucaua trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the central Oakland suburb of Mission Bay and St. Helier's, in the commercial port of Whitemeta Harbour.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a row of fine shops on the beach.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a sophisticated beer but is fine and fresh. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
Although many French wines are available, New Zealand and Australian wines are best suited for travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried about it, bottled drinking water is easy to find.
Australians are unfamiliar with the concept of 'single white' coffee. Short black coffee 'espresso' is a cappuccino filled to the top with cream (not butter), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is in line with Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and the wounds caused by these reefs are rare.
But be advised by all authorities, observe all signals, and keep a close eye on security alerts.
Box jellyfish form in the coastal and near-shore areas between October and April 1770, and are rarely seen outside these seasons.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Many sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The saltwater crocodiles are not active in the sea, and their primary habitat is the reefs north of Rockhampton.
The booking of accommodations in advance gives the traveler the comfort of knowing that he will have a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, and you can book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transportation to/from the airport or even compact airplane and hotel packages.
They can hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests should be sent through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of festival attendees choose to camp on the spot, which many attendees consider an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the show up close, you'll have to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
The music on the main stage may have ended, but note that some parts of the festival may be playing late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin, because when crossing the ice, the most affected people will hear a loud noise.
Passengers on the St. Petersburg cruise ship spend time in the city. Passengers on board do not need a visa (check the rules).
Casinos generally make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by visitors. They generally lack windows and clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages, but while drunkenness is a matter of common sense, skilled gamblers are aware of the importance of abstinence.
Anyone who is going to drive on high altitudes or more mountainous roads must be wary of snow, ice or extremely cold temperatures.
The roads are icy and snowy, and the friction is so low that you cannot drive like a starry road.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall to trap you in a short period of time.
Melting or snow melting and the condensation on car windows or ice may limit visibility.
On the other hand, in many countries, ice and snow conditions are normal and often traffic is continuous throughout the year.
The safari is one of the greatest tourist attractions in Africa and a highlight for many travelers.
In popular usage, a safari is a trip by land to observe the fascinating African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to be close to cars, while standard equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and tigers are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A mobile safari (also known as a "walk in the woods", "walking safari", or "walking safari") can take anywhere from a few hours to several days to complete.
The 2021 Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, with some events being held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Winter Olympics, hosting the 1964 Games.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 ahead of time, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, many coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were due to be held.
Tickets for most events cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the average cost being 7,000 yen.
Even if the room is not available, many hotels may request temporary storage of the sticks and boards.
If you don't have a hair dryer, or you don't like to wear socks, you can use a hair dryer.
Be careful not to make the fabric too warm (it may get hot, or in extreme cases, it may get wet).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, a minute is enough to save water, while in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you may consider buying sealed water from a reputable company.
Tourists may encounter animals and insects that are unfamiliar to their habitat.
Insects can spoil food, cause pain, or in the worst cases, cause allergies, toxins, or infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that brutalize or kill people, are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and duties in some places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, which is frequently traversed by isolated forested tracts, is a highly dangerous driving route between Marion Pass and the Fairmont.
If you are unfamiliar with rural driving, keep your wits about you: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and roads with sharp curves.
The speed limits imposed on the front and rear sections are remarkably low - on average 35-40 mph (56-64 km/ h) - and compliance with them is even more important.
Curiously, the cell phone service here is stronger than in most other areas of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria, like in their southern neighbour Austria, are very rich and varied.
Fruit pastry abounds, with apple treatments in the pastry throughout the year, and cherry and plum are delicious together in the autumn.
In many German baked goods, the nuts of the barm, hazelnut, and other trees are seen. Popular cakes often go well with a thick cup of coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, look to places like Berliner, Funchuchen or Krapfchen.
A jingu is a dish that is made with herbs and spices, either meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of solution, a precipitate can be either dry or wet.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, curries are made mostly with yogurt; in southern India and other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is the most commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine, a selection of 17,000 islands, is a catch-all term that covers a wide variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term originally referred to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now common throughout the archipelago, includes a variety of well-known dishes, with the main seasonings being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic condiments.
The seatbelt is a belt that helps the rider to support the legs that fall towards the side of the saddle.
They provide great stability to the rider, but the rider's feet can get stuck in them, causing safety problems.
If a rider falls off his saddle and his leg gets caught in the saddle, the horse may be dragged along. To minimize this risk, several precautions can be taken.
First, most horsemen wear high-soled boots with smooth, rather narrow bottoms.
Also, especially in some English saddles, there are safety belts that help the rider to escape from the saddle if the rider is rear-ended.
The Cochamo Valley is the premier mountaineering destination in Chile, the Yosemite of South America, with its massive limestone-like walls and high mountains.
The peaks of the mountains offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world continue to establish new routes between its endless walls.
Alpine skiing, which includes snowshoeing and snowboarding, is a popular form of skiing on snow-covered terrain with snowshoes or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity that is popular amongst snowboarders, commonly known as "ski bumpers", who spend their entire vacation in a ski resort.
The concept of skiing is very old - the art of representing skiers dates back to 5000 B.C.!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first ski club in Australia as a recreational sport.
Skiing with a ski pole on the back: This is also known as ski touring or ski hiking.
It is associated with but not usually associated with alpine-style snowboarding trips or mountaineering, the latter being performed on sloping terrain and requiring more robust snowboarding equipment and boots.
Imagine a pathway that runs through snow, similar to a footpath.
In good conditions you can cover more than walking, and you can rarely get up to speed on snow-skiing through the countryside without the big bumps on well-trodden roads.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travel to many countries involves multiple visits to visa application and passport control processes.
However, the Schengen Area is a country in this regard.
As long as you are in this zone, you can normally cross the border without going through the passport control checkpoint again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no common definition of what manufactured items are considered antiques. Items older than 100 years, some tax agents define, are considered antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
The handicrafts can be defined as antiques, but they are much younger than similar mass-produced goods.
