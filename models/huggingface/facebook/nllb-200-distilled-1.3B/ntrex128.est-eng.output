Members of the National Assembly in Wales are afraid of looking like Muppets.
Some members of the National Assembly are outraged by the suggestion to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue has been sparked by a plan to rename the National Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political parties in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour National Assembly member said his colleagues were concerned because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For the benefit of readers outside Wales, the Gaelic word daft means "crap" and pwp means "poop".
The Plaid member said that the whole group as a whole was not happy and had suggested other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group welcomed the name change , but noted that the word MWP is very similar to Muppet.
To clarify, in the English language, the letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English u.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the bill on the name change, said: The final decision on all the names by which members of the National Assembly are invited is, of course, made by the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the name proposals, which show broad support for the idea of renaming the National Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name Members of the Welsh Parliament, or WMP-d, but the public opinion poll was strongest in favour of MWP.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching agreement could prove a challenge for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table amendments to the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules for the deprivation of rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly shall be vested in the members themselves during legislative deliberations.
Macedonians hold referendum on changing country name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is being held to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to that territory and has repeatedly objected to its EU and NATO membership bids.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes a referendum on the name change, has said he intends to ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price the country will pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent as Harlem churches struggle.
"The older people I've spoken to have said that once upon a time there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr Adams.
There's no more of either.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People communicate differently nowadays", he said.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people spend their daily lives.
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and that "sooner or later they will be back to square one".
Adams added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings, whose apartments are filled with people who do not lend a hand to the other shrines in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white, he added, which is why they are hastening the day when all these churches close their doors, as it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of these churches.
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which had previously worshipped nearby, took over the building.
The African-American congregation occupied St. Martin's Church led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of shopkeepers on Harlem's main shopping street, 125th Street, when they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson's congregation planned to rebuild the building, they used a carillon, or bell, to play the song.
The son of Father Johnson and the heir to the throne at St Martin's, the Reverend David Johnson proudly called the carillon "the poor man's bell".
In July, however, the expert who played the carillon gave it another name: cultural value and irreplaceable historical tool.
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan expert, also noted that the world's first carillon was played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play the larger carillon 18 years ago in a Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martin's has been plagued by a history of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved with the church's secular leaders, others with the bishop.
In July, the church's governing body, made up of church or secular leaders, complained to the bishop that the diocese was trying to pass on the expenses, even though the charge had nothing to do with hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's actions.
In California, a 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark while diving for lobsters
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. in Beacon Beach near Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving for about half an hour with friends Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries of apes and then swam to help the boy out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was expressing his excitement at receiving the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
His entire skeleton was torn apart, Hammel described the sight he saw when he reached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: There is a shark in the water!, Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego in a life-threatening condition.
The species of shark that attacked is still unknown.
Rescue boat captain Larry Giles told a news conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier but was later determined to be not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas from Casabla to Swamini for 48 hours for investigative and safety purposes.
Giles added that the area is home to over 135 species of sharks, but most are not considered threatened.
Sainsbury's is planning to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking over the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-style beauty outlets with expert consultants.
As part of a major push into the UK's £2.7 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home goods decline, wider lines of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, with other stores set to roll them out next year if successful.
Investments in beauty products are being made because supermarkets are looking for ways to use up the shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it plans to double its range of beauty products to 3,000 items, including for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
The existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt Bees will also be given more space in branded stores such as those currently in Boots' stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique make-up line, with most products suitable for vegans, as younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing exclusive sales licenses at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second to open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that retailers are becoming more and more like supermarkets as the chain tries to compete with low-cost retailers like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and it's done the same thing with Habitat stores since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly boosted grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's earlier attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended in a dispute over how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was devised after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores three years ago for £125 million to Celesio, who owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is also playing a role in the strategy by adding luxury skincare products to its four stores, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's business manager Paul Mills-Hicks said: We have changed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained staff who are always ready to advise.
Our branded selection meets every need, but the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive beauty destination that can change the way we shop.
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby has turned down an £11 million deal.
Dragons Dan star Peter Jones has left the show after presenter Holly Willoughby scrapped an £11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby's running out of time for Truly, a brand of home goods and clothing.
Couple of businesses have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced on Instagram that he was stepping down.
Holly Willoughby let the anger of Dragons Den star Peter Jones take its toll, stepping down from the luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "angry" when the TV star admitted in a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlows Buckinghamshire that his new contracts worth £1.5 million meant she no longer had enough time to devote to the homewares and clothing brand Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes in the UK.
One source said "Truly" was definitely Holly's favorite.
It was supposed to secure his far future, so she thought she'd be doing it for the next couple of decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the matter completely confused.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse at Marlow's headquarters full of ready-to-sell merchandise.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of "This Morning", one of Britain's highest-paid celebrities, could cost the company millions, because of the huge investment in products ranging from sofa pillows and candles to clothing and homeware, and the potential for a later launch.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016.
The couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin on ITV's Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "I don't want to comment on his business dealings".
It's hard to talk about what we fell in love with.
Trump joked about criticism of him in the news for comments some consider "unfitting for the president" and for being too positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his funny news anchor voice:
I've given up nothing.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea denuclearizing.
But negotiations to abandon nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "corresponding reaction" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament moves.
He also noted that the US will continue to apply pressure restrictions.
Trump's pep talk was a lot more lively.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
"The war with North Korea was about to begin.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we're very good together.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results, ending missile tests, helping to free hostages, and arranging for the repatriation of the remains of American service members.
He also defended his unusual relationship with Kim.
"Being president is very easy, but instead of having 10,000 people waiting outside to get into this packed stadium, it's better if we have almost 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate Indonesian island, killing hundreds
When the earthquake in Lombok was being repaired, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be resettled, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international assistance.
Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international help, so things are a bit complicated, said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palus, it's not clear if foreigners will be able to work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether to allow international agencies to assist.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly unprepared to deal with natural forces.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was issued, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in the Philippines likely increased the death toll.
Traveling between Indonesia's many islands is quite challenging even in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics there even more difficult.
A hospital ship that stopped in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site.
President Joko Widodo made repairing Indonesia's broken infrastructure a central part of his election campaign and he has allocated money to roads and railways.
But budget deficits are threatening Mr Joko's government as new elections are held next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from tensions among the religious minorities in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to a more conservative form of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced by street fighting between Christian and Muslim mobs using machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See, Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a hat trick in the game against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute in Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqir, being about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team led 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it toward the post further away.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the top right corner of the net.
It fell over the bouncing Bepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get into that position, get to the ball and players like Shaq pass the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kant coming, I made one touch and I hit him without thinking.
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0 on a 25-minute field goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the Blues forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before he turned around in midfield and went for Liverpool.
Kovacic gave me a quick pass in the middle.
Then he made a nice air feed, led Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard got through the defence and hit the ball with his left foot past Liverpool player Alisson Becker towards the net.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA EuroLeague on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings in a 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday that produced 60-foot-high [18 m] waves, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he stabbed his wife to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are asking anyone who may have seen or heard anything to contact them.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras might have recorded anything, to contact us, as they may have information vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged friends of the woman came to the scene asking questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police say they're notifying the woman's next of kin at this time.
A cab driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the house.
The man was shocked to hear about the incident.
The residents were told that it might take hours to get back into the house.
A police officer told a man overheard that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman at the scene, crying.
He kept saying, "This is terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police buses were still in the closed area and a third was right next to it.
A number of police officers were stationed in the area, watching the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using the password 247 of the 30 September log.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the last monument to be re-written, the cause of the quarrel
Removing it would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious objects by his inhuman followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as foolish and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was impossible to leave the monument to Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace intact.
Cromwell did not loot the paintings himself during the English Civil War, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps the false ancestor of the Cromwellian man, Thomas, was sacrificed for the actions of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is a testament to 19th century opinion and part of the history of a man many people still consider worthy of reverence.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people in the late 19th century rather than today saw Cromwell's Parliament as a defender of outside pressure and in this case of course of the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate account is a matter of endless historical debate.
What is certain is that the strife of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation and Cromwell clearly represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
A Chinese farmer was stabbed to death by the killer.
Local media reports say a farmer was attacked by a pig at a market in southern China, killing a man.
A man identified only by his last name Yuan was found dead with a bruised artery and covered in blood near a bone in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs at his table on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly come with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the side door was open.
He said there was a big oryx with a bloody mouth in the middle.
The coroner's inquest confirmed that the farmer had been reportedly vomited to death by a 150-pound (249 kg) orchid.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed", reported the newspaper "Guiyang Evening News"
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market leaders are reportedly discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, pigs have been seen attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 1,000-pound [294.83 kg] pig had nailed itself to a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife scare the animal away.
When a farmer in Oregon ate his own pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs do not normally attack, but the taste of blood can make them go into a frenzy.
They're just playful.
They're very curious maracrates, not meant to hurt.
"They just need to be respected enough", said the man.
Hurricane Rosa's aftershocks bring heavy rainfall to the southeastern United States
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves across the northern coast of Mexico toward cooler waters.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southeastern United States in the coming days.
At 5:00 a.m. eastern daylight time Sunday morning, Rosa was classified as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 83.5 miles per hour, moving 400 miles [619.59 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure system will form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to direct deep tropical moisture toward the southeastern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will reach Mexico City, where it will rain up to eight inches [25.4 cm].
Then, in response to the approaching low pressure, tropical moisture will produce extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest of the country in the coming days.
Occasionally, two to four inches [2.54 to 10.16 cm] of rainfall can cause dangerous flash floods, flooding, and possible landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity causes rainfall to increase by about two to three inches [5.5-7.5 cm] an hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas of the southeastern United States, especially Arizona, are also expected to receive between two and three inches (5.08 and 10.16 cm) of rain.
Flash floods are possible in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall.
Surely, if you are in danger of tropical rain, you should not walk in the desert.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into fast-flowing rivers and sometimes cause gusty winds and hailstones.
The approaching low pressure will bring occasional torrential downpours to the Southern California coast.
A total of more than a foot [1.27 cm] of rainfall is possible, which may cause minor flooding and slippery roads.
It would be the region's first rainfall during the rainy season.
Scattered tropical downpours will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, with heavy showers expected Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, the United States is forecast to experience large temperature swings caused by cooling in the Arctic, while temperatures in the tropics remain high.
Sometimes it causes large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday's weather in the central United States is a prime example of the significant temperature fluctuations.
Temperature variations between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, can reach almost 80 degrees Fahrenheit [20°C].
In the days ahead, the long summer heat will try to pick up again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October with temperatures reaching a wide range of 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80°C], from the southern plains to the northeastern part of the country.
New York City is expected to see a temperature of 26.6 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the eastern United States is likely to experience high average temperatures in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Thursday the gripping confessions of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who allegedly accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political gridlock continued as broadcasters interrupted regular programming to cover last-minute rotation on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake signed a contract with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grazed him on the head while drunk and tried to rip off her clothes at her high school prom.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that it didn't happen.
The Nielsen report estimated that more than 20.4 million people likely watched the broadcast on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of the television channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems calculating the number of people who watch public service broadcasts.
By comparison, that is about the same audience as at a football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel's opinion leaders, who strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks in a daylong session with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, came in second.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
Interest continued after the trial.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught the man Friday morning, as he was being taunted by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to a legal committee hearing.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes down when he was accused and it was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power, whereas so many women are completely powerless".
Flake said his department issued a statement, adding before the elevator closed that he had more to say at the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks broadcast the live broadcast several hours after the Judiciary Committee was due to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he's only doing so on the understanding that the FBI will investigate charges against the candidate next week, which the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was partly persuaded by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat.
After a subsequent discussion with Coons and the other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not get the Kavanaugh vote without the investigation's confirmation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of playing a political game
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of "playing a political game" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another newspaper interview, which featured Theresa May on the cover with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pushed his attack on May's so-called Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other was "completely mindless".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a man in connection with the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in jail on a charge of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, adding that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde into death.
The lawyer announced that the man's bail was set at $350,000 (U.S.).
The East Baton Rouge coroner released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the neck area.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement in the area for "putting the ball in play and bringing justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6'2" man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team is "shocked and devastated" by Wayde's death.
"It's something you worry about all the time", Wade said.
A volcano is spewing ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano as activity resumed in the crater, which has produced 183 gas and ash eruptions in 24 hours.
The centre has been monitoring a number of murmurs and vibrations.
Images shared on social media showed the windshields of a car covered in ash in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the declaration of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands joined protests to celebrate Catalonia's vote to leave.
A group of masked separatist fighters, held back by riot police, attacked the last of the eggs and powder paint, creating thick clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The riots continued later when police had to use daggers to control the fighting.
For hours, independence supporters chanted "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" and clashed with demonstrators calling for national unity, chanting "Long live Spain!"
According to local media, 14 people with minor injuries were treated at the protest.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal but which pro-secession Catalans nonetheless celebrated.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low, as the vote was largely ignored by those opposed to leaving.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to disrupt a vote outside polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence supporters had spent the night outside polling stations on Friday night to avoid demonstrations in support of the state police.
The protests did happen, but they had to go the other way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a pro-secession demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia independent.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
I saw my parents crying over the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck", she said.
Despite a major but small victory in regional elections in December last year, pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with a number of prominent leaders either in exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records a demonstration in support of police on her cell phone, said the riot was instigated by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since last year, announced that he would stand in next year's European Parliament elections.
Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the Spanish government's pressure,he said.
Londonderry: man arrested for crashing into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was hit by a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent at around 7.30pm British time on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gate and the building.
It could also have been fired at the car at some point in the bowline.
A menga shot gives Livingston a 1-0 lead over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston has won the game.
Livingston, promoted, slapped Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's punch proved decisive as Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian by a second.
Gerrard remains unbeaten in the Premier League this season and will face Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euroleague.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his unbeaten streak to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt the taste of defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing his chance against the Nerds.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they hit the goal, as their straightforward style of play was causing the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts were thwarted in front of goal as Alan Lithgow made an effort to get Craig Halkett's header through the net.
The hosts calmly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the visitors in certain areas.
And that's also the way the game's goal was scored.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston had a shot, in which Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga played a scheme, who took the ball and managed to do it from the middle of the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but were unable to penetrate the defense, which made goalkeeper Liam Kelly all but calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the goal once.
Rangers goalie Allan McGregor deflected Scott Pittman's shot and Lithgow shone brightly in Livingston's next team effort.
The shots were continually delivered into and out of Livingston's penalty area, and two penalties were also sent off, one for Halkett's attempt to replace Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
A phenomenal achievement by Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaron Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Every player was great, completely exceeding expectations moving up the ladder.
Their style of play and their players have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but Holt deserves credit for the way he has hardened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, putting together a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralli on their backs throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, lacked enthusiasm.
Despite their intermediate good standing under Gerard, it was short-lived by local standards.
Their last possession proved to be incomplete: the home run was only scored once, which could act as a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan's controversial reception in Cologne
In Berlin on Saturday, there were smiles and a cloud of concern as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have been left out of such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new gigantic mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police cited security and banned a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but a crowd of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host the Turkish president.
The violent protests show that attitudes toward the visitor are divided: some Turks in Germany hail him as a hero, while others despise him as a dictator.
Motorcycle crash on Deptford Road, cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred on a busy road near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver pulled over and paramedics arrived to help, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist was killed in a crash nearly two kilometres from the scene of Saturday's accident on Childers Street, where a cyclist was hit by a car and fled the scene.
London police said authorities were working to identify the man and notify his family.
Traffic at the scene has been closed and buses diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison.
The riots broke out at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 0930 British Summer Time and have not yet ended.
Special riot police are involved in the riot, which involves eight prisoners.
Prison officials were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: Prison staff with special training have been called in to solve an ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Five crew members were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and their prison sentences may be extended.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
But in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to quell a major riot in which prison officials were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (for areas with high tides, a hurricane may be beneficial)
Tropical low pressure is not common in Arizona, but it will likely occur early next week as the raging storm Rosa moves across the desert of the southeastern United States, posing a threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, California and southeastern Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The forecast is that Rosa will head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area with rainfall as early as Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure level within 200 miles [321.86 km] of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models forecast 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters of rain, with up to 15.24 centimeters in restricted areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other desert areas of the southern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, rainfall is likely to be between one and two inches [2.54-5.08 cm], with up to one and a half inches [10.16 cm] in limited areas.
For areas prone to flash floods, the Rosa rains can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a cause for concern, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because of the drought in South America.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona is in extreme, or Category 2 drought, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa crosses the Baja California peninsula on the Mexican mainland.
Rosa, still at hurricane level on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 6.43 kilometers per hour, is now 2,000 miles [619.95 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles [19.31 km] per hour.
The storm is coming into contact with cooling waters in the Pacific and is therefore easing slightly.
So Rosa is expected to make landfall as a tropical storm Monday afternoon or midnight.
The amount of rainfall in certain areas of Mexico may be high, posing a significant risk of flooding.
From Baja California to northwest Sonora, rainfall totals between 7.62 and 15.24 centimeters, with up to 25.4 centimeters in some places, weather.com reported.
Rosa then moves northward over Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that moves over Arizona and reaches southern Utah late Tuesday.
"The main threat from Rosale or its aftermath is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert of the southern United States", said the National Hurricane Center.
These downpours can cause life-threatening flash floods and floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests in connection with attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 0400 hours British Summer Time on Sunday.
The victim was taken to hospital in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have cell phone records of the case.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered" the "hate and hatred" of the Democratic Party.
"Supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the Democratic Party's ruthless and unacceptable tactics", Trump said in his pep rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered" during the nomination process "the hatred and hostility of the Democratic Party".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that a man assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Also at the hearing, Ford testified about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "America saw the glory, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh that day".
"The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most respected legal scholars of our time with an impeccable record in public service", he told a supportive crowd in West Virginia.
The President made a direct reference to Kavanaugh's appointment, while also speaking of the importance of the Republican campaign in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running, he said.
That's why I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder".
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican aide told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed and many more washed up as giant waves washed up on the coast after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when a 20-foot [6 m]-high wave hit the beach, killing many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach doing their jobs, not fleeing immediately and becoming victims said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for BNPB, Indonesia's disaster relief agency, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it took cars, logs and houses with it, wiping everything off the face of the earth", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved at 800km/h on the high seas before reaching the coast.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 center.
Aerial photos released by the Disaster Management Agency showed destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and water-covered mosques.
The aftershocks in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located on a long and narrow bay, may have increased the tsunami's intensity, the BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher in the coastal area of Donggala, 300 km north of Palos, which was closer to the epicenter.
The reports from Donggala are completely incomplete and contain no information", Nugroho said.
The area has over 300 000 inhabitants, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its team and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, and it could get worse,he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not alerting the city of Palu of a tsunami, even though officials said the waves reached the coast at the same time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building warning people on a panicked street of an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, a wall of water comes ashore, washing away houses and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages, which hampered communications in the Palu region and made it difficult for authorities to organize rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending aid planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue operations, remaining closed in other parts until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
This is really bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they were sheltered by gift baskets in the yard of their office, they saw shattering sights along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
This is really bad.
Although relief efforts were vigorously undertaken, some complained that experienced staff from foreign aid agencies were prevented from travelling to Palus.
Under Indonesian rules, foreign funding, supplies and relief forces can only be sent if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
It is still a disaster at the provincial level, said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
If the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can start accepting international aid, but that has not been announced yet.
As the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunami arrived in Palu, the friends and families of the missing were still full of hope that their loved ones would be the miraculous events that lighten the gloom of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer pit.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Indonesian national parachute team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing parachutists for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
The others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel are his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a senior parachute pilot, I have a personal burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon talked about how after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread among the skydiving community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors at the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray bird instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means the messages didn't get through", he said.
The thieves took 23,585.88 euros while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levees.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $23,585.88 from a Brinks employee at a Newport on the Levee ATM, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied the ATM at the amusement park and prepared to bring in more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the man was acting, another man ran behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to a press release, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about the identity of the thieves is asked to contact Newport Police at (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, a man tweeted about the change, writing: Ex-Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and the man used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
She's replacing Ariana Grande, who canceled her concert during the "Hours", the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the man's current stage name, West has previously said that it is a word with religious significance to him.
"I think ye is one of the most used words in the Bible, meaning sin", West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with a radio host, Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, they're us.
I changed my name from Kany, which means "the one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of us, our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
Kanye West is not the only rapper to play with his name.
Sean Combs is known primarily by the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also used his name in pencil and without pencil, with uppercase and lowercase letters.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Sunday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to contain Mexicans.
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people as leftist student movements swept across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying monthly stipends to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its research spending on this field, said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and artificial intelligence expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after statements were made by various parts of the US government regarding AI, although the US generally does not have a formal AI strategy.
At the same time, China last year announced its plan to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US and we are working towards the next breakthrough in AI, Lee said.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next big AI breakthrough will be in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that won the American Othello Award for best player.
Lee acknowledged the previous US government technology competition such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the next dreamers.
US scientists have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"China is not taking over the educators, it is the companies", said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired brilliant university scientists to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the US support its artificial intelligence efforts.
I think that people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should be given a green card automatically, said the man.
The State Council of China published the next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense launched the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage partners from both industry and academia.
This month, DARPA announced that it had begun funding a $2 million initiative called AI Next.
But the National Science Foundation currently funds over $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, the US legislation to create the National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence has not been changed.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has prevented Macedonia from ratifying EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to that territory and has denied Macedonia membership in NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on Macedonia's new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name would undermine the national identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether voter turnout will reach the 50% required for the referendum to take place.
The referendum asks: Do you support Macedonia joining NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price Macedonia, one of the post-Yugoslavia states, must pay to gain membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective hand of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to change the name.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the previous general election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
I came to vote for my children.Our place is in Europe, said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in Strumica in a Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name to allow them to join NATO and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage in front of the parliament building in Skopje, raising tents in front of chairs for those who were ignoring the referendum.
We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join upright, not through the servants' door, said Kavadarkov.
We're a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and get some of the benefits of European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
I believe that the vast majority will support the name change, as over 80% of citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO, said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said that the "yes" word would be "the guarantee of our future".
Polling results released on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies revealed that 30-43% of voters plan to participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said yes.
The referendum's success rate is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government's Western policy since it took power in May last year.
Look, Manchester City player Sergio Aguero is going through the defence of Brighton for the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem like his 65th-minute goal came ridiculously easily.
The Argentine striker came through the midfield at the top of the standings.
He went through three Brighton defenders before he got to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He forced his way through another defender before running past several players at the Brighton penalty area border.
Then he hit the ball to his left where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first stroke to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguerol has foot problems", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he knocked on the door at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their initial lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton territory.
He sent the ball beautifully through the air to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane got to hit the ball a couple of times before he led Sterling further.
Sky Blues hit the ball into the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play cheerleader against the Rockies.
When the Nationals were out of the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to start over.
But the fighter Scherzer is hoping to take down the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, still have a shot at the World Series.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure their first division status.
"Although we're not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in this crowd and with the other team in Denver is probably a higher level than any game I can expect this year.
Why wouldn't I want to race here?
The Nationals have yet to name a starter for Sunday, but they're reportedly leaning toward Scherzer's pass.
Scherzer, who was serving his 34th, was warming up on Thursday and eating his usual Sunday.
This Washington right-hander leads the league with a .187 ERA, a .2.53 ERA, 300 strikeouts and 220 2/3 innings pitched this season.
Trump is giving a pep talk in West Virginia.
The President made a direct reference to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while also speaking of the importance of Republican voter activism in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.
It is a big event, and I am not running, but I am running, so I am everywhere to fight for the great candidates", she said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing this terrible, very terrible extremist group of Democrats.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over for power and control, all they want is power and control over everything, and we're not giving it to them.
He said the Democrats were on a mission to 'resist and hinder'.
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "enemies, villains, villains and liars".
He was referring by name to Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee member Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was shouted down loudly in the audience.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait  that was one of the worst examples of body language, in fact, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a big union.
It's intolerable for people to express their opinions.
When the activists of my local Momentum party voted to condemn me, it wasn't a big surprise.
After all, I am the last Labour MP to be told you are not welcome, all for expressing your opinion.
My colleague in the House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was a strong advocate of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was condemned by the judges for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar issues that Jeremy has had disagreements with previous leaders on.
The Nottingham East Labour Party said in a statement that it "wishes the meetings to be inclusive and creative".
For the most part, my eight years as a local Labour MP's experience with Friday night assemblies is exactly that.
Unfortunately, as things stand today, this is no longer the case for most meetings and the promise of being "better and more generous" in politics has long been forgotten, if it was ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not acceptable in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on who is acceptable to the leadership.
It started right after Jeremy took over, and a colleague with whom I thought I had similar political views was now waiting for me to change my mind and take positions that I would never have otherwise agreed to, whether on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak out in public, no matter what I actually say, it's followed by condemnation on social media, calling for my recall, ignoring party policy and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and determination of those who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never compromise.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy area is how abuse levels have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we're not that big of a union anymore, and every "No Trust" initiative or change in the electoral code narrows the party.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, talk less, and "it'll be all right".
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had left my great school classroom on the verge of collapse, I have tried to speak up for better public services for those who need them most, acting both as a local councillor and a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
Under no circumstances could anyone in Nottingham East have been misled about my political views or areas of disagreement with local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I want to say this: when the country is moving towards Brexit, which is hurting our households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from acting in what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 3817 Melrose: undefeated Ayr moves to the top
Two late runs might have tipped the outcome a little, but there's no doubt Ayr deserves a win in this wonderfully fun first-team game for Tennant.
They're now the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was the team's high level of defense and better risk taking that led the home team to victory and coach Peter Murchiel has every right to be pleased.
We are tested all the time during the games and we are still unbeaten, so of course I am happy, he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "I respect Ayres, they used their opportunities better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute field goal, which Frazier took over Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but the yellow card to Scots captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors, gave Melros a shot, with Jason Baggot making a missed field goal.
Climo extended Ayri's lead with a penalty kick just before half-time, taking a single shot to 175 in Ayri's favour.
But Melrose had a successful start to the second half and Patrick Anderson's shot over by Baggot cut the gap by five points.
Then a long delay occurred due to Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, after which the man was taken off the beam.
The AIR's acting captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, but once again Melrose player Bruce Colvine paid for a failed pass attempt after heavy pressure.
However, the home team was back on their feet and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for obstructing Climo without a ball at the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball behind the advancing Ayres.
Climo passed the ball, as he did almost immediately after the game resumed when Kyle Rowe caught a David Armstrong box and sent out the winger Gregor Henry in the home team's fifth inning.
The star of the game still wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems poised to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he was named CEO of a prominent restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor will play Jack Jarvis in the acclaimed BBC television series, which he writes and stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems that Kiernan is making new plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan is interested in the Glasgow restaurant business.
The sea is ours: Bolivia without borders hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific again
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The flags shall be of blue above the buildings of the Agency.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have a slogan: "The sea is our right".
It is our duty to restore it.
In Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling on October 1 from the International Court of Justice after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has a spirit of dynamism, unity and peace, and the country naturally expects a positive outcome, said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Crowds of Bolivians around the country watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia, forcing Chile to negotiate with Bolivia to give it an independent path to the sea after decades of fraught negotiations.
Bolivia's charismatic native-born president, Evo Morales, facing a contentious re-election battle next year, is at stake in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed in late August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court is unlikely to vote in favor of Bolivia, or that if it did, little would change.
The United Nations Office in the Netherlands has no power to hand over the territory of Chile and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision comes only six months after the final hearings suggests that it was not a complicated case, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And apart from Bolivia's additional causes, the last four years may have made things worse.
The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities, said Zárate.
Morales' bellicose charm has lost all remaining goodwill in Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile are going to continue negotiations at some point, but after all this, the negotiations are extremely difficult.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily hasty.
Monday gives Bolivia a once in a lifetime opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile and to end 139 years of divisions for the benefit of both sides, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most prominent presidents, uses the maritime issue to express political resentment.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,he added.
A decision is a chance to see that we have to get over the past.
North Korea has said that it will not denuclearize until it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to give up their nuclear weapons if Washington could not be trusted.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made by the leaders of the rival countries to each other at the Singapore summit.
He's making his comments as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looks set to resume deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said the airstrikes were a "showdown" because the US continued restrictions and refusal to declare an end to the war in Korea would force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is cautious about such a statement unless Pyongyang takes the first significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously planning to abandon arms, which it sees as its only option to ensure its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion showgirls in Paris bring to the viewer a series of massive headgear that is brought to shoppers on their neighborhood's shopping streets
If you want to add to your hat collection or to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought to the stage a series of bizarre oversized headdresses for their 2019 summer season that dazzled the Paris fashion scene.
High and impractical hats are all the rage this summer on Instagram, and these designers have posted their signature creations on the fashion pages.
Valentino's masterpiece was an oversized beige hat that covered the models' heads, decorated with a wide brim that resembled a fleece.
Other oversized items of clothing included jewelled watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also showed off a strange selection of masks, making it just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks had curled mouths, so they were more Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One piece of the design resembled a diving suit with a hose and goggles, while the other resembled a melted icebox.
And if you keep up the giant, giant, giant, giant, giant, giant, giant, giant movements, you're in luck.
Moogurs predict that oversized headlights could reach the shopping streets near you.
The super-sized hats are coming right after La Bomba, the two-inch-wide shoulder cap seen on the heads of celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that created the largely impractical hat, which was blown up on social media, sent another great piece to the fashion world  a shoulder bag, almost as big as the bikini model wearing it.
The dark orange raff bag, with its raffine strings and white leather strap, was the highlight of Jacquames La Riviera's 2019 summer collection.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the streets next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are important for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland have remained at the forefront of the academic excellence rankings and this continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
These schools, which have a combined enrollment of over 30 000 pupils across Scotland and are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and their parents.
The purpose of private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, for their chosen professions and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it gets into their head.
If you talk to him in his native language, it will reach his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results from this year's exams show that the top of the charts are the languages with the highest pass rates among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied the foreign language received high A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received an A in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now included in the curriculum are in private and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills study revealed that 17% of respondents cited a lack of language skills as one of the reasons why employers have difficulty finding workers for vacant jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future jobs.
While more promising jobs require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, learning a second language is a real advantage in the future, for language skills are life-long.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign nationals gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation.
This is why funding language learning is important for today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children a better chance of finding good jobs.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
A number of schools focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages considered to be the most important in the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interests, private schools always offer the choice of several languages taught by experts in their field.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed no matter what the future holds.
It is no longer a matter of denial that languages are vital to the future of a country in a globalised business environment, and this must be reflected in education.
It is modern languages that should really be considered as international communication skills.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots choice, diversity and excellence.
I must do well.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
Eager fans no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he's played has yet to be determined.
"It's over one and under 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After last week's practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a preseason game to warm up at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's campaign event in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five campaign events Trump has planned for next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote is pending while Trump chooses who to nominate to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, he is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans threaten to lose control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's campaign rally tonight in West Virginia and how do you watch it online?
Trump's campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held this Saturday evening, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 PM Eastern time.
The Trump West Virginia campaign event can be streamed online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be talking about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, which has become tense over sexual misconduct allegations, while the Senate confirmation vote has been delayed for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of the campaign series is to help re-energize Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign manager said that their five-week event is meant to showcase volunteers and supporters as the Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters reported.
"Controlling Congress is so important to the president's agenda that Trump is going to dive into as many states as possible during the fast-moving election season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Tonight's campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could draw supporters from across "Ohio and Pennsylvania" and receive coverage in the Pittsburgh media, reported West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the last month, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey of West Virginia, who is leading the polling boards.
"For Mr. Morrissey, it's not a good sign that the president has come to cheer his results", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is nervous for the competition, keeping expectations high ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon games were perhaps just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pivot pendulum is a completely fictitious concept in sports, but the players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the tipping point is now?
"They led by six points, now they're four, so I think I can consider this a bit of a turning point", said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, which is clear, because they lead by four points and there are 12 points left in the game.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel they don't have enough wind on their sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has been outstanding in both tea and green and is setting an example.
Those victory cries from the throat grew louder with each lap, overshadowing the decisive pot that would have brought the fourth match to a draw after he and Thomas were down by two.
His winning putt on the 15th sent a similar shout, showing his belief that the Americans are not out of the race yet.
"You just have to play more focused and worry about your match", said Spieth.
It's the only thing the players can do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed Ryder Cup stars Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
A European couple, strange but in love, are four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
The only couple to not hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, the only couple to avoid bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into and out of the noisy crowd reinforces the opinion that the players who compete on Sunday and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, there will be no more famous players to secure a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferred both in different holes at the same time.
But the rumors of European glory are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job of getting Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the first nine, digging the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep, they had no hope of getting out.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out.
Four-ball and pairs games are extremely fascinating to watch from close up, because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't get and how the way things can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and they're in the lead with a solid lead going into the final day, but this four-man session showed that the U.S. team is getting nervous for a fight that some, especially the Americans, have questioned.
Europe is in the final day of the Ryder Cup 106 to lead
Europe will have a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, taking a 10-6 lead over the United States after Saturday's four-ball and pair matches.
The brilliant duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current Le Golf Nationals score to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who had been committed to retaining the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, reigned after a disappointing American side in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the doubles game, winning two games, but they couldn't make up the deficit.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from 12 singles games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, and along with Molinar, who are known as the Molliwoods after a wild weekend, they are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their opening four games.
After knocking out four-balls Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, beating Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more decisively, 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed some casual brilliance, but has now lost 29 of his four-balls and 19 of his doubles, with seven straight losses.
Justin Rose, who had rested for four-balls this morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in a pair of games, beating 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world number one and number three respectively.
In Europe, it failed, although the contest was held in pleasant, windy weather south of Paris.
Three-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the Americans a two-point lead Saturday.
They won four-ball-only 2-1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in a pair, having lost the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to go into the singles, even though as the owner, Furyck's half needs only a wick to keep the trophy.
Although they're two days ahead of second place, after Sunday's counterattack, it looks like they're not gonna make it.
North Korea says they will never under any circumstances disarm unilaterally because of a lack of trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued restrictions had deepened its distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Trade Organization's annual meeting that over the past year, North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures", such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the US responding", he said.
Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security certainty and under these circumstances we are by no means willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally first.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's resistance to a gradual approach to denuclearisation that rewards North Korea for taking gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to move towards "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the stringent international restrictions on North Korea.
The US is first to demand the abandonment of nuclear weapons and is increasing pressure on restrictions to achieve their goal by force, even opposing the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
Understanding that limitations bring us to our knees is a dream for people who don't know us at all.
But the problem is that continued restrictions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader emphasized at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: If South Korea, not the US, had been a party to the nuclear issue, the issue of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate.
However, Ri's speech was a stark contrast to last year's speech when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile drive into the US mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim at the UN for his courageous steps toward disarmament, but added that much more work remains to be done and that restrictions must remain in place until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: The Security Council's enforcement of restrictions must continue vigorously and without fail until we can fully and definitively affirm the renunciation of nuclear weapons.
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased restrictions on North Korea in an attempt to prevent Pyongyang from financing its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met in Riga on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip didn't go very well.
After a historic meeting with Pyongyang, he said progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him in just a few hours for "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised at Moon's meeting this month to dismantle its missiles and nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim had told him that by "corresponding measures" he meant the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University is offering a new course where students are required to sleep more to combat a growing aggressive culture of studying through caffeinated, night-long study marathons.
Students who love academics at the world's best university are often helped when it comes to basic truths about taking care of themselves.
The course's designer, Harvard Medical School sleep specialist and professor Charles Czeisler, an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, says it's the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk on how sleep disorders affect learning.
And at the end of it, this girl came up to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my last year of high school?"
He said no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - it struck me as a shock, he explained to the Telegraph.
The course, which was introduced to the curriculum for the first time this year, will explain to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also help improve their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health services at the university, said the university decided to adopt the curriculum after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the workweek.
The one-hour course includes several conflicting tasks.
One section shows a picture of a common room, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleep habits.
The second part explains how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with the opposing symbols encourages participants to think about their established daily routine.
We know that this will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
He said that people still take pride in nighttime study marathons, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate quality sleep should be a student's weapon to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added. It even helps to prevent weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making the person constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to help create a university-wide course.
As a next step, it wants all postgraduate students to undergo a similar training programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set their alarm clock for both bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor away result when Dolly Menga's shot sent off by Steven Gerrard gave Livingston a 1-0 lead.
The Ibrox side were hoping to win their first away game since February when they defeated St Johnstone 4-1, but Gary Holt's side only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, falling eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes into the half and the Rangers ' poor readiness never recovered .
Rangers fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, trailing Hibernian by just one goal.
For the Rangers, the trouble may not be over yet, as their forward Calum Spence needed treatment for a head wound after being hit by an apparently discharged object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side, which took Ayr and Betfred through to the semi-finals.
Holt, meanwhile, went on with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy to see his well-trained boys smother their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have been more dominant in the field, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored in the second minute of the first half when Menga's first substitution sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his shot.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-arc shot into the back of the post.
The Rangers were in control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt strongly that he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, referee Steven Thomson did not satisfy the Columbia player's complaint.
Rangers managed just two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about Lassana Coulibaly's header or Ovie Ejaria's attempt.
While Liv's 34th-minute comeback may have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their performance.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to contain Jacobs' deeply difficult performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit a ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga, who simply carried the plan to the end.
Gerrard moved in at halftime, swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a trade that almost paid off when the winger tore up Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came through to block.
But Livingston continued to lure the guests to play exactly the kind of game suited to them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up a long ball.
Holt's side could have been promoting their lead in the final, but McGregor stood firm, holding Jacobs off before Lithgow hit him from a wide corner.
Rangers' backup Glenn Middleton again sought a penalty after he went up against Jacobs, which Thomson again did not satisfy.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
From this scientific foundation, the Geiger counter became a pop culture staple, as in the 1950 film The Coronado Bells, starring the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is this?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When wearing these earplugs, you can hear the sound of atoms being detached from the radioactivity of the minerals.
Don't tell me that's a little bit of a jerk!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" rogue cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" rogue cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize rogue cells as part of treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying those cells in the laboratory
Then they can make a protein that is common to many cancers and they are injected back into the body.
The vaccine in this study shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to detect rogue cells lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, which are then modified in the laboratory to make the n protein common in various HER2 cancers, and then injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 drives the growth of many cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells are taken from patients and trained to target cancer cells, has been used to treat certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West started out with a Trump-supporting tribe, wearing a MAGA hat on SNL's Live.
It didn't go very well.
You're in the studio watching Saturday Night Live, and Kanye West has been met with a scathing response from the crowd after his confusedly delivered speech in which he praised President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the same office in 2020.
After performing her third song that night, "Ghost Town", wearing a hat that said "Make America Great", she began to yell at the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
I've talked to so many white people who ask me, "How can you like Trump when he's a racist?"
"If I was so worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", she said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon, where a Hollywood celebrity joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual assault.
Although the episode did not air, West's noise footage was uploaded to comedian Chris Rock's social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the post.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time with his hat behind the scenes.
They made fun of me backstage.
They told me not to go in there with my hat on.
They tricked me!
And then they say I'm drowned somewhere", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see the drowning place? I'm going to put on my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments provoked viewers' anger on at least two occasions and appeared to embarrass the SNL crew.
West was brought on at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande because the singer's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his song "I Love It", which he performed while looking like a bottle of Perry.
West was endorsed by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one brave soul:
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing.
But I have decided NOT to reward (by buying my music or my clothes or by supporting his art) anyone who I believe believes in and promotes a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
"Like us", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now the ex Kanye West.
He is not the first singer to change his stage name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dogg has been known as Snoop Lion and of course, the recently deceased music legend Prince, who has changed his name to a symbol.
Attempted murder charge in connection with the stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution is investigating the charge.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has a problem with the masculinity of the guy.
Kit Harington is best known for his blazing role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor dismisses the stereotype of the aggressive hero, saying that such on-screen roles mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought "something has gone wrong" and raised the question of how to tackle the problem of masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he felt "very strongly" that the problem needed attention.
"I feel quite strongly that we have gone wrong with masculinity", he said.
What have we taught men as they grow up about the problem we see now?
Kit believes that television, with its supermanly characters, is partly to blame for the rise in masculinity.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets makes young boys feel that they must be just like that if they are to be men.
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because obviously something's gone wrong with the young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would never participate in any Game of Thrones sequence after the series ended the following summer, saying that he would be on one side of the battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will be participating in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a filmmaker and his brother who is a kidnapper.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing to happen to Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so it gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Keith's character Jon Snow, on the Emmy-winning fantasy series.

HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has jumped to 14%.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40 000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been from sex, reversing the past.
HIV was mainly spread in some parts of China by infected blood transfusions .
But the number of people infected with HIV had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 a year.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly high.
Because of the country's long-standing values, studies show that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many disease transmissions are linked to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed public access to HIV treatments to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking the employee GOP senator's data, saying it's "dangerous falsehoods" and "claim theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that her employee had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are being spread by ultra-right trolls and their websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The information disclosed allegedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utah).
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Traditional websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and gave away the membership information of a Waters employee, Hill said.
This unfounded claim is a complete and utter lie, Waters continued.
My employees, whose identity, personal data and safety are at risk due to these fraudulent and false claims, are not responsible in any way for this leak.
This unfounded claim is a complete and irrefutable falsehood.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is based on anger", wrote Fleischer.
It suggests he has an emotional state that is not congressional.
If someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not become angry.
They must not be disloyal.
They must not question the prosecutor's motives.
They need to stay calm.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican nominee Omar Navarro, who is running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It matters if it's true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant federal and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations.
We will do everything we can to identify the perpetrators, he continued, and hold them accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for all my employees.
Johnny English Strikes Again, a spoof of the under-appointed Rowan Atkinson
It's now common to look for Brexit meanings in all new British films, and it seems particularly relevant in the parody series of Johnny English's screwball comedy that began in 2003 with Johnny English and was followed in 2011 by the revival of Johnny English Reborn.
Is it humorous to joke about how obviously stupid we are about the country's new export capability?
In any case, the red-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has been given permission to do things in his own crass way again - and that this wide-ranging comedy is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, this is a secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretentious smock glamour, is a little bit like Clouseau, a little bit like Mr Bean and a little bit like the character who set the tone for the Chariots of Fire special at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It's also based on the character of the traveller and international mystery Atkinson, once played in a forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, who leaves nothing but chaos behind.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE movie.
I loved the way Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval iron suit and the helicopter wings momentarily tapping against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer self-confident comedy.
It seems that this humor is more for children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's cunning adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movies as Bean.
It is now a perpetually current presumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has hacked into the UK's top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of every British secret police officer, leaving a local agent in deep disgrace - a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is a feasting and troubled character suffering under the weight of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character brilliantly, but there's not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisers suggest that since all active spies are at risk, he should call back someone who's retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolteacher in a very prestigious institution, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers School of Rock-type spy schools.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and is reunited with his former long-time partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the disgraceful spots of His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale portrayed by Olga Kurolenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the thumb of a dangerously charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve all of Britain's computer problems: the hapless Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their whimsical odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by secretly boarding the luxury yacht Volta; and English sets off a veritable riot as he attempts to use the virtual reality master suite to explore the interior of the Volta house.
This last section doesn't use any brakes, but as cute and bustling as it is, the whole thing has a kids' TV mic on it.
It's pretty mediocre stuff.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I started to wonder: Is it really not the British film industry's responsibility to give Rowan Atkinson a role that is fair to her talent?
Labour has denied drafting a plan to make the British work four days a week but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a revolutionary plan to make the British work four days a week but get paid for five.
The party wants the company bosses to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the employees by giving them one extra day off.
This would give workers three days a week - but the same pay.
According to the source, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and would tilt the state in favour of workers.
The Thursday workweek has been approved by the Trades Union Congress to allow workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a review of the bill will be announced before the end of the year".
It will not happen overnight, but the Thursday workweek is an effort that fits with the Party's approach to balancing the economy to the benefit of both workers and the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party also promised a Thursday workweek during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: Thursdays are not party policy and will not be discussed.
Vice Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to clarify his vision of a socialist turn in the economy.
McDonnell said he's decided to take back power from the "unseen" managers of utilities and "profit servants".
The Vice Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not get their entire stake back because the Labour Party could make "discussions" about perceived wrongdoing.
It confirmed its plan to put employees on company boards and to create inclusive equity funds to give 10% of private companies' equity to employees instead of giving annual bonuses of up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into the cover-up could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination by at least a week and raises questions about whether the bureau's findings could affect the end of support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday interview, 60 Minutes co-anchor Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I told them I was going to the hearing, I told them I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusations came out and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, firm and unambiguous.
Graham's voice seems rock solid.
"I am firm in my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh, and that can only be changed with a bomb", he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know how it happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one he's named could confirm that.
This is a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the annual Global Citizen Festival, a music event with a huge celebrity audience and an equally impressive goal: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Law not only enjoy singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness about the event's true purpose, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by steadily increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks or volunteer activities, email a world leader, make a phone call, or do something else of importance to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when they have another 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to get them to demand action, or is it just another click where people feel like they're doing something important by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million activities of its supporters, working towards a range of goals.
Accordingly, these actions have helped world leaders communicate more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and communications resulting from their activities, of which at least USD 10 billion have already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the UK-based investor-implementer partnership The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to helping children reach their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a landmark reminder of social injustice, said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to a question from a KKK on their website asking, What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: It's a long and hard road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But as we face great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are confident of our success because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a few of the performers who will perform at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval blockade to block Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington may use its navy if necessary to prevent Russia from gaining access to energy markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has said.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the belly of Southern Europe", he allegedly said.
And the official says there are ways and means to address this.
The United States has this opportunity, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and if necessary blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to market,' he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to participants at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation which is the voice of the US energy consumer.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more or less one of boosting and replacing fuels, he said, while referring to Russia as a one-trick pony whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration's mission is to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to reject the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into Moscow's "prison".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the USD 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak at a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The US position has been met with a backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem with a third country interfering in our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she's seriously considering running for president in the midterm elections.
At the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his consideration of running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the first lady", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren also criticized President Donald Trump's actions in the city hall, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents don't think he should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of "likely" Massachusetts voters thought the senator should not run.
32% supported such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% supporting a possible candidacy and 48% opposed.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision by January, The Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes from the Donald Trump rally Track Palin's PTSD
Track Palin, 26, spent a year recruiting from September after Iraq.
He was arrested Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged
"What my son is going through, what he's going through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa's Oktahama.
Palin called his son's arrest an elephant in the room and said of his son and other veterans that they come back a little different, they come back untamed, they come back wondering if there's enough respect for what soldiers and pilots and all the other military people have done for the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he's been charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia are contesting new asylum policies.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and territories filed a brief in Washington on Friday in support of a challenging asylum policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit filed by the ACLU in August against federal policy has not been released.
The woman said that her accomplice and her violent gang members' sons abused her, but U.S. officials refused to grant her asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries that produce large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, with gangs and domestic violence being major problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of national, Union and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle, the court friends' brief stated.
The lawyers also argued in the brief that denying immigrants entry would hurt the U.S. economy, saying they were likely to become entrepreneurs and "lack the necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer offer asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, said Sessions in his June 11 statement.
The purpose of refuge was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertaining rescue operations in Bali, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dangerous.
"The situation is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her fever-stricken baby son at the evacuation centre in Palu.
Every minute, new people arrive in the ambulance.
Clean water is not enough.
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through the debris and trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated in the field due to continuing severe after-effects.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a powerful earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
"I didn't have time to save myself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in the rubble", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger.
US Ambassador accuses China of harassing workers with "job advertisements"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad under the US Daily News about the daily benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to an op-ed in the Des Moines Register last Wednesday, paid for by the China Daily, Iowa's largest circulation newspaper, after China was accused of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, adjusting each other's import tariffs.
The Chinese countermeasures at the start of the tariff war were aimed at targeting exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts have explained.
The US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, as well as China's largest agricultural exporter, Terry Branstad, said Beijing was harming American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Des Moines Register op-ed on Sunday: China has now doubled down on its harassment by running speed-work ads in our free press.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's precious freedom of speech and free press practices by placing its paid ads in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
In contrast, there are only limited voices on the streets of Beijing and there is no real difference of opinion among the Chinese people about China's worrisome economic direction, given the strong control of the media by the Chinese Communist Party, he added.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans will alienate female voters ahead of the Kavanaugh fiasco midterm elections.
While many Republicans are waiting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned they will see a setback in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment surrounding the situation has been heated and most Republicans have already indicated they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be undone", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article for The Hill on Saturday.
The Treeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute effort to address the FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, was quoted as saying by the Washington DC newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" at a rally in their Senate corridor as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
Democratic drive and confidence are starting to fall off the charts, informal political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters aged 18-29 who dislike the president and often skip voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing his allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts predicted a setback if the Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
"It's become very confusing for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News earlier this week.
It's not just about the Commission vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it's also about how Republicans have handled it and how they have treated him, Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the American public seems to be a little divided, who believes in the testimony of Ford and who believes in Kavanaugh, but a little more in favor of the former.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford's claims and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals when they attended a party in the 1980s while studying at Yale.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet that will rival Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, started a startup company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech giant's latest project Inrupt is a company that develops the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is given access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is "to rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online database or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and competent tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all coming in the same browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online database is that the user can choose who can access this information.
The company calls this the 'personal authorisation through data'.
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company would bring the resources, process and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform bought by IBM, a few contracted developers, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about implementing a complete change once all their business models are fully supported overnight.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Memorial to the World War I Victorian Clergyman
The Church of England, the only church to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I, celebrated its 100th anniversary in its home town.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann fought for his medal on September 29th, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper's bullet, unaware that he had been awarded the highest decoration in the British Army.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "brilliantly symbolic" if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through a thick fog of Japanese guns and machine guns.
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it forward with "great gallantry" before he rushed alone to one of the gunners and knocked out three of his opponents.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanni was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were something I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful.
He and his brother Dr James Vann laid down the pear after a parade led by the Brentwood Royal Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honoured to be part of the parade and added that the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero can be appreciated.
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206 but all they saw was Piggy Pepa.
Imagine you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, but you're not shown the main event.
The San Jose match featured 13 fights, including six from the main draw, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK all night.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face off, UK viewers were stunned by the appearance of Peppa Pig on screen.
Many were not thrilled, especially those who had stayed up late to see the fight.
One fan described the switch to children's comics on Twitter as "a bit of a sick joke".
It is government regulation that at 6am the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to children's programming, explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
- Peppa Pig, yeah. - I know.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they plan to work on their schedule to take more into account UK viewers in the future.
If I think about the replay now, I think we can solve this problem in the future, Coker said.
But if it's 6am on a Sunday, we can't do it until our Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text, and not all of it was friendly.
We tried to fix it, thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't. It was government policy.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We're showing five instead of six fights, like we usually do, trying to give the fans more, and we just went over time.
This is a very difficult situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior when it came to sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it was not until high school that he realized that "not everyone is like him".
Speaking on Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs, she said she speaks about gay rights to give hope to others.
Also, becoming a parent changed her attitude toward winning the Olympics, making it seem less important.
You'll find the usual longtime host Kirsty Young had to take a few months off due to her illness.
On the first episode of Laverne, Daley said he felt inferior growing up because it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
She said, "To this day, that feeling of not being worthy and feeling different has given me the power and the strength to succeed".
She wanted to prove she was worth something, not let others down when they finally found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a highly regarded LGBT campaign leader, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She said she talks about it because she's lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "took her by surprise".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than her last year, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
When you go through so much at a young age - she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find someone her age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all-out outlook" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal", he said.
But you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father wouldn't die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you can't sit in the front row because you'll be gone by then,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died did I finally admit that he is not invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling", she said.
It also inspired her first song collection, Heather Smalli Proud, which helped her prepare for the Olympics and still makes her goose bumps.

Out of the game, Mickelson was eliminated from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson sets a record Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he's having to work on his form to avoid an unfortunate crossover.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was ejected by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's doubleheader and four-ball.
Instead of being the center of attention, as she has often been for the United States, the five-time winner split her days into two, being a cheerleader and working on her game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old is not particularly suited to play on the cramped Le Golf National golf course, where a long, rough course constantly punishes missed shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the up-and-coming British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday in his ninth match, who has joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
With the Americans, who are down by four points in 12 singles games, starting off strong, Mickelson's contest could be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but she had little else to add.
"He fully understood his part for today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk added.
He's very confident.
He's a celebrity and he's given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more coming, but it happened, and we had to take this path.
He wants to be out like everybody else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for most Ryder Cup appearances.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never matched his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has given the team an additional spiritual boost.
'He's funny, funny, funny, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in the team room,' she explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun going up against him this week and it was great to see.
He's offering a lot more than just a game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that a great advance may soon be lost.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a big lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup at the start of the singles can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane came into the public eye at the 1997 race in Valderrama, where he and captain Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but by the time he crossed the finish line, it had dropped drastically, winning by just 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You even remember we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, it came very close", said Bjorn in the photo after the Class of 2018 win 5:3 on Friday and a 10:6 victory yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history tells me and the entire team that it could happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get your points.
We have a goal, and that is to win the Cup, so we're focused on that.
I've always said, I'm focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world.
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to rush things.
Tomorrow we're going to have a whole new set of obstacles.
Tomorrow's the day of personal achievement, so it's a whole other story.
It's nice to be with your opponent when things are going well, but when you're there in person, you're being tested to the full as a golfer.
That's the message you have to give your players. Give it your best shot tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's gonna have to go and fend for himself.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury hopes his players perform better individually than with opponents, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in the last few days, being part of the Brooklyn team that won before losing when Europe beat the Miracle of Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put everything they had into the game on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you're gonna have to start hot, like in Brooklyn and like in Medina.
If the tide goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average race.
We'll set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel will make tomorrow a miracle.
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the race and is best matched with Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best Europeans in the race.
"I put my boys in this line because I think we're covered", said Bjorn about his selection of singles games.
The new German warship pushed forward again.
The German Navy's newest high-speed sailboat was supposed to be commissioned in 2014, replacing aging Cold War warships, but it won't be until next year due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fast sailboat Rheinland-Pfalz has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was due to join the Navy as early as 2014, but the troubling post-handover problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class fast-ships.
Understandably, they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technology, such as radar, infrared and audible attenuation.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest speedboats should be able to leave their home port for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the advanced warships - which allow Germany to strengthen its power abroad - become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The failed F125 superyacht made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder after receiving it.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited several significant "software and hardware deficiencies" that made the warship unfit for combat use.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg class ships are operated by a crew of around 120 seamen - only half the workforce of the older Bremen class fast sailors.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to incorporate future innovations.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is probably twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the team, becomes a problem.
It is said to be EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) - up from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the new high speed craft are particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German Navy is decreasing its capacity.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy had in fact run out of 'mining-ready ships'.
The official said that the issue has grown like a snowball over time, as the old ships were scrapped but no replacements arrived.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fast-ships could join the navy.
The National Trust is investigating the secret lives of bats.
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the terrain to find their food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
A study by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland tracks the common and soprano pipes, as well as the brown long-eared bat and the Daubenton bat, in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key locations in the area to monitor bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct field surveys using handheld sensors.
Competent assessment of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and the species activity.
A map and report of the habitats are then created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information helps to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of hedgerows and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, the population of bats has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and its loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and the chemical processing of some building materials, as well as attacks by pets.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use sophisticated beacon-location techniques to detect insects and obstructions on their flight path.
The NTS, which oversees more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained specialists who regularly conduct examinations, inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in Threave, Dumfries and Galloways, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that this area is ideal territory for them.
"We have a big area for bats in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a big, good place to live.
But there's still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need.
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before starting any maintenance on the property, as unwanted destruction of one birth and birth site can kill up to 400 mothers and young, and even wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing or destroying them is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer with the Scottish Badger Association, has urged the public to help.
He said, "We have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don't know many of our species and how their colonies feed".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to advertise themselves" using his name.
Her lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel for the allegations.
The Portuguese-Juventus attacker is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayor, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman €330,643.10 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers half an hour after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, was reported as "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no, you know what?
"Today's news is false", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the news.
They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's common.
They want to make a name for themselves with my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine", the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a complaint with Der Spiegel regarding the disclosure of an unauthorized suspicion of privacy.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player is seeking compensation for moral harm, which is consistent with the gravity of the violation, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor allegedly went back to the player's hotel room, where he was allegedly raped, according to documents filed in Nevada's Clark County Circuit Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was 99% a good man, of whom 1% are lucky.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed a sexual relationship with a couple, but it wasn't unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was afraid of retaliation and was worried about public humiliation.
Now, the 34-year-old woman says she's trying to overturn the settlement because the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer he moved to Italy in a €100 million deal from giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK may regret leaving carmakers forever
The UK would regret it forever if it lost its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop manufacturing at its plant in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border disruptions without a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
The Burnston plant, which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that when the UK starts to leave the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our plants", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnston.
Other UK carmakers have also feared leaving the EU without a deal, citing concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month because of Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is on-demand, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border which industry has said could cause delays and parts shortages.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than a day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, so production has to be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future of the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls.
We need an agreement.We want the best solution that will allow us to do what we want, and not just take advantage of the current success but take full advantage of the opportunity, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence, not only for Toyota but also for other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain package.
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a representative of Unite's trade union, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said his members were increasingly worried: "We know from experience that if jobs go, they won't come back.
A government spokesman said: We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed another week as the fight against top-seeded Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has not confirmed that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announcing his intention to resign.
Instead, it was announced on Thursday that he would meet with Trump, who was then in New York at the United Nations.
Trump said he did not want Rosenstein fired, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coinciding with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying a Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: The date is not yet set, it could be this week, but it could be postponed another week, given all the things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll watch it and I'll keep the press informed, as always.
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of news hours was not due to TV journalists intentionally disappointing themselves, although he added: "I don't dispute the fact that they are prepared to be disappointed".
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president does more Q&A sessions than any president before him", he said, without adding any evidence: "We've looked at those numbers".
The briefing will continue, Sanders assured, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot, and you've seen how we've done it over the last couple of weeks, so it's happening during a press conference, when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated perhaps why, by walking freely and sometimes with a strange appearance before a gathering of reporters.
The Minister for Health wrote to EU NHS staff in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's thanks and wishes for their survival after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent her letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of settled status for EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: The summer saw continued negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, with the UK expected to reach a decision this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also prepared for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Fellow workers from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the way healthcare works and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury and being hit 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He fell on the floor and just collapsed", Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen while he was in a coma before he was placed on a monitor and taken off the field for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center is over.
Harris added that the type/ extent of the injury is not yet known and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Red-shirt sophomore Abercrombie was in his first season at Tennessee State since moving from Illinois.
He had five fights before he left the game on Saturday, making 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher down payment when they buy property in the UK, using the extra money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This move will undermine Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
Template tax is levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury hopes to create up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, using the extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to lure young voters with promises of affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The Template Tax is a tax on individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, channelling the extra money into the government's drive to fight homelessness.
The additional charge, in addition to this stamp duty, including the higher rates imposed two years ago for second homes and for purchases related to the retreat, may be up to 3%.
The Treasury hopes this move will generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of all purchased London properties are owned by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot in the door.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" thanks to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big building firms of keeping property prices high when they buy land but don't use it and called on May to give up affordable housing quotas to correct the shame of the UK's housing situation.
Corbyn has announced a sweeping housing reform, including rent control and an end to the bullying of innocent people.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I promised that I would commit myself as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - to making life better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is true that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as businesses based abroad, find it as easy to buy homes as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away and harsh sleeping conditions are the normal reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become leader of Scotland at some point.
The Scot, 42, is delighted with the challenge of reviving a North Eastern club currently in third place in League One, just three points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got a B-class and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up with my dad watching Scotland in Hampden and it's always something that's drawn me back.
But that opportunity will only come if I'm successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid of such big and well-known names having previously managed both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success at the moment is when I can take this club to the Champions League.
Because of its structure and facilities, the club is undoubtedly in the Champions League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get there, but I only see myself as successful if I can get the club back there.
Ross has only been a manager for three years, having previously been deputy director of Dumbarton and 15 months on the senior staff at Hearts.
He then helped Allo to recover from relegation to the third tier and make St Mirren's lowest position the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real crossroads", he recalled, "the takeover of Alloa".
I really believed that driving was more suited to me than playing.
It seems odd, because I made it, I made a decent income, and I enjoyed some highlights.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of stuff that needs to be done every week.
I still feel it in the stress and pressure of my job, but the leadership just seems more justified.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable now than I ever have as an adult.
You can hear the full interview on Sunday, September 30th on Sportsound, Radio Scotland from 12pm to 1pm BST.
Well, according to the study, the best time to get a pint is Saturday at 5:30.
The summer heat has boosted the turnover of Britain's troubled pubs, but increased pressure has been put on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that pubs and bars increased in July by 2.7%, while restaurants fell by 4.8%.
These figures were compiled by Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA: Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was similar to June, with pubs growing by 2.8%, except that restaurants were even harder hit.
Retail sales of restaurants, which fell by 1,8% in June, deteriorated further in July.
The pubs and bars that focus on drinking were the most successful, and the restaurants that tried to please the people were the worst.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as the restaurant owners.
It seems people just wanted to go out and drink.
Between the pubs and bars, sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales fell by three per cent.
Leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the 4.8 percent drop in sales from a year ago is particularly painful in addition to ongoing price pressure.
A long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses and only time will tell if the cooler temperatures we experienced in August provide some much-needed relief.
The overall sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in branded establishments.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data for 47 business groups with total turnover of over £9 billion and has established itself as an industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rise in fake Instagram pages
News raised fears of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic account" to show their parents.
The study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, set up secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a significant increase in fake Instagram accounts.
The news raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had both a "basic account" designed to be shown to their parents and one designed to be acceptable to them.
One who discovered the secret pages of his 13-year-old daughter saw that the teenager was inviting others to rape her.
Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), a private school organisation, found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles and half of them acknowledged having personal accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing to see so many teenagers being tempted to create online accounts where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the athlete's spokesperson for the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive chairman of the board at the annual meeting of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most acclaimed athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for sporting leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is respected throughout Scotland, the UK and other sporting communities and we are sure that Scottish athletes will benefit from inviting him to the leadership, said Beattie.
Doyle said: I want to be a spokesperson for athletes and I hope to make a real contribution to Scottish sport and help it develop.
An American who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now shares his views frequently on the BBC was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that whether I would recover and when, to what extent, would be a matter of time.
I've been working hard, but I'm fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and I'm already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
A breast pump ad comparing women to cows splits the Internet in two
The breast pump company has split the Internet into two camps with an ad comparing a nursing mother to a milk cow.
Rumor has it that to celebrate the launch of the world's first silent breast pump, consumer-facing technology company Elvie released an ad similar to the ironic music video to showcase the freedom this new pump offers to mothers who want to live off their own.
Four real mothers dancing on a table full of hay with cows and singing, "Yes, I'm licking myself, but you can't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't udders, these are my breasts".
Repeat the line: "Pump, pump, feed the kids, pump, pump, fill my ladies' bottles with milk".
However, the ad on the company's Facebook page has generated mixed reactions on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, the video has a different opinion, many of whom say it sheds light on the dairy industry's backstory.
The use of animals to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that their babies are stolen within days of birth", wrote one.
Elvie's breast pump does not stick to the breast-feeding nurse's eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A totally unimportant ad".
Part of it's for the publicity, and one woman thought it was hilarious.
I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a complete cow.
The commercials are a little crazy, but let's just take it for what it is.
"It's a brilliant product", wrote one.
Another commented: It's a fun ad for moms who pump up (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows.
This ad does not praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they're all dancing in bras with inconspicuous pumps.
The idea behind the campaign is that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely silent, with no wires or tubes, and is not visible from the breast pump, giving women freedom to move, hold babies, and even walk outside while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: The Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.
By comparing women's expression to the cows of the dairy industry, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary freedom that the new pump creates.
This isn't the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
On the London fashion scene, a mother of two was seen wearing a product by designer Marta Jakubowski.
Thousands of migrant children quietly went to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained fairly stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be adopted by sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are documented immigrants who, for fear of jeopardizing their ability to remain in their country, claim custody of the child.
The risk increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could be fingerprinted and the data shared with immigration authorities.
Senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albence testified to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people for seeking financial assistance for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Nearly 80 per cent of sponsors or sponsors' households are in the country illegally and a large number of them have a criminal background.
So we're going to keep on tracking them, ' said Mr Albence.
To speed up the process, officials have enacted new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of their arrest, up from 60 days, according to shelter workers.
Many defend their legal content in front of an immigration judge via videoconference, obviously by coming to the scene.
Those unfit for release will be deported quickly.
According to the shelter staff and reports released by the system in recent months, the longer a child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent protests or escape attempts.
Lawyers say these concerns are more acute in large detention facilities like Tornillo, where a child's fall into difficulties can be blurred by size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to adjust to the environment or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria demands the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on the UN General Assembly to welcome Syrian refugees back home despite the country's eight years of war.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally present on Syrian soil under the pretext of counter-terrorism and were being dealt with accordingly.
They must leave immediately and without conditions, he told the assembly.
Moualem said Syria's "war on terror" was almost over.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy war until we have cleared all of Syria of terrorist groups and any foreign forces illegally present.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions for their return were appropriate and blamed the spread of unreasonable fears that prevented the arrival of refugees on some Western countries.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them,he said.
They're politicizing something that's purely a humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has opened the door for political talks to move forward.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale invasion by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed the hope that military action would hit jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon persuade a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem demanded the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is getting re-elected
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency sooner, as liberal observers would likely like.
What should be, without a doubt, the most exciting end to the presidency!
At this time, the audience shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average peak hour audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has 3.5 million cable viewers, keeping its ratings high during prime time news.
"It's a tension we're in because we don't understand it", said the director of the ABC drama Designated Survivor about the secretary of state who becomes president when the attack destroys the Parliament building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", has another theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He said he made me laugh", Mrs. Scovell mentioned to me.
All this chaos has entertainment value.
Unlike what's shown on television, of course, the Washington rumors could be fatal to the future of Roe v. Wade and the reunification of immigrant families and the global economy.
Staying off the subject is just a luxury for the spectators in the foreground.
But the six-hour panel discussion, which features Bob Woodward's "fundamental research" for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $13,225.73 peacock Bomber jacket (The Washington Post called it "extremely confident in a dress that blows your mind"), and Stormy Daniels' comments about Mr. Trump's vague anatomy, is more than a little tame.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario with the same emotion again.
"One of his activities that can seem like a real-life show is that he shares something every night", said Wheelhouse Entertainment CEO and creator of "Band of Bones", Brent Montgomery, who has been interviewing Trump for his show's alternating cast and schedule (kidding about the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single section or you're running out of time.
This week, Fleiss was in a 80 degree heat at his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he had hidden in his room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't help but watch Brett Kavanaugh perform on the Senate Judiciary Committee and watch the fate of the Supreme Court hang in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all kinds of crazy shows and people said this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money flows elsewhere to the most exciting White House midterm elections.
It's no wonder Pennsylvania's 17th district is getting a cash flow from the redistricting, putting two market-dominant companies in the same seat.
This election has returned to office the Democratic representative for the Pittsburgh suburb of Conor Lamb, who won a special election last spring to fill a seat in the second district.
Lamb's opponent is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were altered after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which made the old districts unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th general election has sparked a campaign of cash-flow booms between the finance departments of the two major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee and the Republican National Campaign Committee.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a highly-watched March 18 Pennsylvania congressional district special election.
This seat has been held by a Republican for decades, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political opinion leaders have given the Democrats a small advantage.
US El Salvador punished for supporting China, then withdrawn
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which was a small setback for Washington.
Mr. Trump met in a friendly atmosphere with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned the Panama Hotel until the partners kicked out the Trump corporate management team.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that those countries had recently stopped supporting Taiwan.
But only El Salvador was scheduled to be punished, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug surveillance, development and economic stimulus.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year seen as a development in efforts to prevent settlers from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made clear that they wanted to continue the consultation and end the discussion on any sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence, who will address a mid-October meeting to discuss the administration's position, is now being criticized.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further harsh notices or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
History of teaching
What may happen next is that special counsel Robert Mueller will release a report on a possible impeachment of Trump, which the state archives have plenty of evidence for.
Mueller's supposedly also investigating whether the Trump campaign is connected to the Russian attack on our election.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would have to make a statement in this chamber as if he were going to talk to voters again and maybe even his fellow judges.
There are many issues here and I do not want to suggest that the removal of Trump or even his European colleagues is inevitable.
We all have a choice to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would stop him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around such turning points and the relentless march of democracy is getting closer or further delayed.
The American people are facing several turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since it was reported that he proposed a secret presidential recording last year, speculating on his unsuitability for the position.
Rosenstein says the Times statement is inaccurate.
How do you respond when the FBI's recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is neither complete nor fair - or when he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections if Trump is in charge?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter break.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me a candlelight Saturday on a table with a hook.

Norman Eisen, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who is also the chairman of the Washington Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Union and the author of The Last Palace: A European Restless Century Alive and a Legendary House.
Ranger Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the Battle of Rapid Vienna.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Australia, following an impressive win over Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season before a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard to improve.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could do something and we came out with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but generally it was a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
Thursday will be another great and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good run in their last game, but with the people supporting us, I'm sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good run.
Last year was tough, because of it, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all feel good inside.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can move on now, put the last season behind us and be successful.

Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the respondents in a Nationwide survey said that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't talk about it", explained Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance operations at Nationwide.
But that's where we should start.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely costly.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan for how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value to help cover these costs, or a wealthy self-insurance policy - as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop any potential legal battles early.
Get a health care proxy to identify a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that specialists follow your wishes when you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider a trustee in connection with your financial future.
Choose a trustworthy person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer any questions about medications and allergies?
Write these things down so that you can be prepared if needed.
It is not just the financial side that counts, but also who the doctors are? explained Martin.
What medicines are needed?

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll is still rising.
With communications lost, rescuers have received no information from Donggala Regency north of Palu, which remains closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located on a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, and had an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly struck by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Regency is a region extending over 300 km (180 mi) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities in Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, mainly concentrated on the Morowali coast, opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, the last 100 years have seen several tsunamis in the Palau and Donggala.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, Indonesia, in North Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits the southern tip of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck an area near Padanh, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits the island of Mentawai, Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A powerful earthquake hits Aceh in Pidie Jaya regency, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
Although there was no tsunami, more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Larger earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a female tried to report alleged crimes to the police, Palin took her phone.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bail, the CTU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty of any crime", the news network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, police called his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the outskirts of central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment the earthquake occurred.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu City.
In New York City, federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack a bike path along a West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, killing both pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to the death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, court documents indicate a possible death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, and assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack involved "extensive planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "deplorable, cruel and immoral".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, stated in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the last death trial in the Southern District of New York.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in New York was in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a veteran Uzbek, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police say he told investigators he was happy with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
Police say he also wanted the ISIS flag displayed in his hospital.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "clearly disappointed" with the decision.
"We believe the decision to seek the death penalty will prolong the trauma of all involved, rather than a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the guilty", Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
According to the Tory MP, Nigel Farage should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people" during a protest at today's Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must have felt the heat of Euroscepticism because one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the UK would be out by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May is facing a problem in reconciling her deeply divided ranks, highlighted by pro-Remain Conservatives joining her anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is having a hard time keeping her Chequers plan on track amidst the attacks of Brexit supporters, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the backlash and force the Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between his package and the EU.
Bone told Leave Means Leave at a rally in Solihull that he wanted to abandon the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage be made a partner and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'His responsibility would have gotten us out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: I am in favour of Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan.
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: The view that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is not true.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: "I'll say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Checkers' plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually walk down the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Please, drop the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.
Farage said the politicians in the rally must be made to feel "heat" if they plan to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us, the people and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let that happen.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, uncomfortable.
We will mobilize the people of this country who gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
Meanwhile, the icebreakers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city center.
A handful of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" slogans after the group was formed this weekend.
The Liberal Lord Adonis has ridiculed the Conservatives for the security concerns that their party's implementation of the opening conference was part of.
These are the people who say they can bring IT systems and all the technology to Canada and even more so, smooth cross-border, unrestricted cross-border trade to Ireland, he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren of the United States says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future Saturday at the Western Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running in the November election against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's vice presidential candidate in the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's speculation that he could be running against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
The person in the audience asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means the First Lady.
There's been an arrest in the LSU Sims shooting.
LAPD in Baton Rouge announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at around 11:00 a.m. ET at a news conference.
They released a video of the shooting Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen on the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday via 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and he confessed to being at the scene, possession of a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6-foot-2 Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, 10 of them as a starter, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world championship after a team record win over Sebastian Vettel.
From that moment on, it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday against Lewis Hamilton, that the Mercedes team's ranking plays a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost knocked Hamilton out when he defended his position on the first two occasions and called on Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel took the lead into the pit stop, leaving Hamilton's group behind in a heavy traffic jam that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit lane later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after being on the side when the Ferrari driver malfunctioned to leave the inside of the track clear for a pass after a third corner attempt to defend it with a double-step.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving through the tyre-swollen finish and passing Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He finally made the pit stop on lap 44, but failed to accelerate on the final eight laps, giving Räikkönen fourth place.
Today's a tough day because Walter's been doing a great job all week and he's been a real gentleman letting me pass.
"The team have done a great job of having one of the two", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday over the incident for not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the West Virginia rally, the President did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate right now, which shows that people are "serpentish, disgusting, and lying".
"The only thing that can happen and the only beautiful thing that is happening right now, which has happened in the Senate in the last few days, is that you see anger and angry, mean, disgusting and lying people", he said.
When you look at the press releases and the leaks, they're like, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question "Did you leak the document?"
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't leak.
- Wait a second. - What?
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak", he added with a senator's face.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July about the Kavanaugh allegations, and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill reported: "I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations or leak his story", Feinstein told the committee.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I did as he asked.
But his denial was not appropriate for the president, who commented during the Saturday rally: "You know what, that was very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's one of the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually abusing three women, the president hinted that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They have decided to take back power without a choice of means.
You see the cruelty and the disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to get power and control", said the president of Mediate.
The Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants , and the Giants 3-3 .
Giants Patrick Dwyer scored two touchdowns against Dundee.
Dundee Stars beat Belfast Giants in the Premier League replay on Saturday, who lost to Dundee 5 to 3.
The Giants came into the game early with a two-goal lead from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the playoffs before Dwyer took the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard had equalized Dundee's lead before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in the Premier League for Adam Keefe's men, who came to Belfast on Friday night to beat Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season, and the Giants won three of their last six games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth quarter at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul and David Rutherford helping out as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team's fastball back into the game at 13:10 in the first quarter before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit a walk-off home run in the 15:16 mark.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead before the first half, hitting the second field goal of the night late in the first quarter.
On the home field, the players rallied and Bouchard brought them back to level, scoring in the 27th minute with a 27-37 lead.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time late in the second quarter, securing a last-third victory in their team's offensive zone.
The Giants, now down four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in their next game.
A pilot dies to save hundreds of people from an earthquake.
An Indonesian pilot was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami that killed more than 800 people, many of whom are still missing.
Heavy aftershocks are hitting the area and many people are trapped under the rubble in the town of Palu.
Despite the fact that Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri's 21-year-old colleagues fled the rocking tower of the airport, Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave.
He remained at his post to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321 which was on the runway at the same time.
Then he jumped out of the airstrip, thinking it was going to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We arranged for a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to another large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the chopper reached Palus.
We were extremely saddened to hear about this. The spokesperson added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, and the National Disaster Mitigation Agency said access to Donggala, Sig and Bouton was restricted.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: The death toll may rise as many of the victims' bodies are still under the rubble and have not been found.
Twenty-foot waves devastated the town of Palu, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and airliners are providing assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, 35, a mother, told Sky News: "The ambulance is bringing in more victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
They're robbing the small market everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we can't tell what they might find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: I ask you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea says one man is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
While all 47 passengers and crew were reportedly safely evacuated from the sinking plane, the airline that piloted the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is missing.
Air Newgini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, they were unable to locate a single male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's details, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday but were in stable condition.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane went off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low on landing.
"It's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to roam through the water at high tide to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He mentioned that the salon attendant was panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The United States Navy and sailors working on a nearby pier also helped rescue people, using inflatable boats to bring them ashore before the plane sank about 100 feet [30 m].
The data from the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in the last two decades in air accidents involving air carriers registered in PNG, but none of them were related to Air New Guinea.
Analyst's working on a schedule for the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor's office closed a review of a case Saturday against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman to death in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spent several hours as an expert observer analyzing intelligence.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Brick and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night the girl died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he obtained location information from multiple cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted the young man's earlier claims.
When the records showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, which is why the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford walked into the courtroom on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car, Sanford said Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before the girl died.
Phone records show the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to make its deposition on Sunday.
The judge said that he thought the case would go before a jury later that day.

Another black guy?!
A New York nanny is suing a couple of courts over a racist message.
A New York nanny is suing for discriminatory dismissal after a couple of days of receiving an accidental text from her mother complaining that her nanny is "another black woman".
Couple denies being racist, compares the situation to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her outrage when she learned that her new firefighting provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a note to her husband saying, "All of you, once again, black".
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after discovering his mistake, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their sociable African-American nanny had done a bad job and was waiting for a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple of courts for severance pay, which he wants to receive at a rate of $350 a day for the next six months, and the same job he was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
I want to show them to look, so do it, she told The Post, adding: I know it's discrimination.
The couple have rejected the accusation that they are racist, saying that ending their working relationship with Maurice was a sensible move because they feared that after insulting the girl, they could no longer trust him.
My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
"We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
But would you let someone you've been rude to keep your children, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
Come on now.
Commenting on the comparison to blackmail, Plasco said his wife was two months away from giving birth and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you go up against someone like that?
That's not very nice", the investment banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, the couple has been quickly condemned by the public on social media, where they have been heavily criticized for their behavior and thinking.
A new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers were concerned that readers would not relate to the talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, wrote: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very interesting to know now what we know about Paddington's great success.
He said that his father, who was inspired to write a children's book about a teddy bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about his job being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was marked by a melancholy death of his father last year.
Of Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", he added that his father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man and not a proud man", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like the feeling when your child accomplishes something: you're proud of them, even if it's not exactly your achievement.
I believe he viewed Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington as himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
"They called regularly to say that her daughter was in very bad condition and that they did not think she would survive", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad, who said my daughter was gonna die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medication the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating had been quietly disappearing from his system.
He was dead a while before that, and now all the systems were shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was gonna happen.
I couldn't howl, scream, or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing of her experience.
"No one knew", he said.
I kept my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outpouring of compassion for Nad on that flight.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.
Postcards from a bored woman prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost their beloved to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted maps on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said her smile made the whole room shine.
Nevertheless, he stopped working before his death because he was in a very bad place with the Joms.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this is going to have a domino effect".
Mrs. Davis made these cards to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even your friend.
Don't be quiet. You have to talk.
Miss Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davis for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything", she said.
We noticed a change in her behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on his first Christmas  when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have eye contact or anything.
Mrs Humphreys said his death was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to deal with it.
It's gonna tear us to pieces.
But we must move on and keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I believed that if we could actually get something he wanted - a limited time and scope of investigation - we might be able to achieve unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would collapse amid a persistent partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans don't do as well as they should, they'll be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to sit on the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has taken to the phone to call the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote is now in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the deciding vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean troops is decreasing under Kim's rule.
South Korean lawmakers have said the number of North Korean troops in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Coordination, said that the number of troops has decreased last year (1127) compared to the 2011 figure of 2,706.
Mr. Park said the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Korean military personnel have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul magazine, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas.
China takes in POWs as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss the elimination of their stalled nuclear weapons.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of failing to make progress on sanctions.
Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security certainty and under these circumstances we are by no means prepared to unilaterally disarm first, Mr Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said the man was unfit to be a Supreme Court justice.
House of Representatives opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the court.
Pelosi made her comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've always felt that if a woman had acted in this way, she would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, describing his family and high school years, at times almost screaming and at times being verbally abused.
He also explicitly condemned the Democratic Party members on the committee, calling the accusations against him over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss "grotesque and coordinated" organized "reputation killing" by angry liberals.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was leaning against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he's attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if she would seek to remove Kavanaugh if the Democrats were to win a majority in the House.
"I'm telling you so much... if she doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, she's not only not fit to be a Supreme Court justice, she's not fit to be on the court where she's currently", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical person to become a judge and expect us to tell them 'Isn't it great?'", Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, a fury that lasts for months and years, and she can't get away with it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
He continued: "I got help from a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said she cried when she got angry, too, but she devised a method where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm pissed off.
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was genius.
Tears are accepted in part as an expression of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of a former male-dominated office where I once found myself crying in indescribable rage when an older woman - a harsh leader I had always dreaded - grabbed me by the waist and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying", he told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and it gives them satisfaction.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a yacht called Monkey Business with an extramarital affair and ended his campaign, deeply upset Schroeder thought there was no reason why he should not consider running for president himself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
Seven candidates have already applied and the last thing they needed was someone else to join.
Someone said it was like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
With the campaign coming to a close, he was late with his fundraiser and vowed not to run unless he raised $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She found that some of her supporters who had donated $1,000 to the men had given her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a cut?" he thought.
When she gave a speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, her feelings became  grateful to the people who supported her, irritated by the system that made it difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of delegates, and hated sexism  so overwhelmed that she had tears in her throat.
"You'd think I'd have a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalled the press reaction to him.
I should have known that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
- She was crying?
How the U.S.-China trade war may benefit Beijing
The trade war between the United States and China has been a daunting one, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the gap between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning shot this year, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, essentially imposing half-way tariffs on goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has responded in kind each time, most recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to shoot back at the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to budge anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean giving in to their demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war with the United States could support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a hasty policy decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that cause another country to lose control of its economy is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged, said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
The foreign minister says Syria is ready to return the refugees.
Syria says it is ready for the refugees to return voluntarily and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
Today, the situation on the territory of the country is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,he said.
The government will continue to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to bring things back to normal.
The conditions are now in place for refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods to return voluntarily.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated state.
However, he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe seized the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight games on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The star of the tournament, Phil Mickelson, hit the ground running on the par-3 track in 16 laps, giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to reach a perfect score of 5:0:0 in the current format of the tournament, which began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest ranked European team, with a score of 5&4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has a 2-1 lead over England's Ian Poulter, who could have won his last Ryder Cup.
Out of eight Ryder Cup veterans, Sergio Garcia of Spain became the most successful European of all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but tonight I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the Cup back.
It's about team spirit and I'm glad I was able to help", said Garcia, who was emotional after the European victory.
He passes the torch to fellow American Jon Rahm, who won the singles on Sunday against American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1.
"I feel extremely proud to have won Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup score of 13:21:3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was on a quest to find fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury said after the team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they were hearty".
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did a very good job.
Let's get it together, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm gonna have to lift my hat.
We were played better.
New information on the watershed: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a decline in the overall concentration of flowering algae in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are reports of more volatile flourishing in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating decreasing concentrations.
The watershed extends approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The bodies can be found 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but the number of bodies has been reduced from last week.
Water fighting has also been reported in Pasco County.
In the past week, Pinellas County has reported average coastal or offshore concentrations, low to high coastal concentrations in Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high coastal and offshore concentrations in Sarasota County, background to medium coastal and offshore concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high coastal and offshore concentrations in Lee County, and low concentration in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory distress in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory distress in northwest Florida in the past week.
