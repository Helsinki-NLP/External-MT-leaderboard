not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but it also offers details that are not so often found in fossils, like colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was clear or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues to the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs, known as racks, do not have a well-developed stem, but they do have other features, such as claws and barbels. In view of this, the researchers concluded that the rack was possibly the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather to display or regulate temperature. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the plumage of an adult, not a pup.
The researchers suggested that although the tail was a young dinosaur, the sample revealed adult plumage, not a feather.

below them are the medium-sized cats who feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat smaller, much more numerous animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat does that keeps them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three adult males of the same family, along with up to 30 females and cubs.
Women are often closely related to each other, being a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.

scientists believe that jaguars follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they've been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and they can also move stealthily. Jaguars hunt their prey by mixing with their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from where they came (e.g. if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in a different environment from the one they lived in before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from the ones they already have and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
n the course of time, as the new population starts to adapt to their new environment, they're becoming less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
we call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.

Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of his era, so the only thing he feared were other Mosasaurs.
Long jaws were clenched with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of the mouth, showing that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have even been a cannibal.

As an example, the most common static image photography form on the planet is 35mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the analog film era.
still being produced today, but more importantly, their proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
35mm is actually confusingly 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the smallest ratio between integers) is therefore 3:2.

The much abused and often demoralized third party law is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example) is the most effective place for the main subject.

There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.

The same goes for the military, since instead of patents being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane life. He used to frequent a cave which became known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the times, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
resting on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
t is not easy to find, even if you know it exists.t once inside the cave, it's a total isolation.
You can't see anything except the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.

The Giza Plateau, or "Gizza Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, features several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and relatives of Khufu.
The "upward-pointing arch" mark has its similar appearance with a V, and the "downward-pointing arch mark" has its similar appearance with a clasp or a square without the bottom side.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow; low means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
Typically a bow up produces a softer sound, whereas a bow down produces a louder and assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.

In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on floating rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.

To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 C.E.).
The Early Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a series of ideas in practice, from the technology supply or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.

car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health care system to heal the injured bodies.
Romance had a great element of cultural determinism, extracted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.


Gothic reached its peak in the 10th-11th century and also in the 14th century.

Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to turn to the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.

THE COURT: Children who are riled may have suffered severe trauma or abuse in childhood, before being abandoned or running away from home.
others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the wild child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the particular pet animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, like using a new computer or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little talking clip from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software to question, alert and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to handle alone.
children are placed in foster homes for a myriad of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care and educate, but it does.
We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
adoptive care is supposed to meet all the needs that were missing in the home they were taken from.
Internet combines both interpersonal and mass communication elements.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratifications.

Personal involvement andcontinuity relationships were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Especially, it is claimed that a person can detect if another person is lying by correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nonetheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities for interpreting human behavior might be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
20th century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the grouping of expressed variation.
segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans, consuming the available plant resources, to meet their requirements for amino acids.

The most accessible plant-based resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they're hard for us primates to digest unless they're cooked.

Sleep interruption is a process that involves waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and falling asleep soon afterwards (1060 minutes).
This can be easily done using a semi-quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up at all.

The level of inner peace a person has correlates in an opposite way to his level of physical and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.

The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in WWII, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the shocks in systems, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the cold war began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years, and in fact, there would be leadership of reserve troops on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.

The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move people and goods while at the same time interfering with their enemies' ability to move their own people and goods.
one of the most notable recent examples of this was the battle of the north atlantic of world war ii. the americans were trying to move men and materials across the atlantic ocean to help britain.
At the same time, the German naval organization, using mostly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
if the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the ability to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.

Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often looked after by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the best-known shepherd. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Though the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to achieve higher speeds and carry larger loads on slightly more bumpy roads.

This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
His predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago. However, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs much earlier, 7 million years ago.
can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want to have just a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and end them.

After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to a printer by John Dunlap.
Overnight, around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon, in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap seizures that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original hand-made copy did not survive.
ae paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
n't a lot of people think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.

They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The greatest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects structured enough to stick to humans.
Both barbers and bedbugs are nesting, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the leading neurological disease in young people and adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their interest, or that of their child.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents rescind their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.

It's not just an experiment, actually; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions. Making observations also guides a scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.

As knowledge of Greek retreated, the West found itself distant from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various observed rhythms in physiology and behavior normally depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
periodic rhythms, which are absolutely not responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a continuous cycle period, even without environmental interference.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that either tagged the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting nature areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.

One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.

In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Thanks to the fact that drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.

Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are dragonflies and ephemeral.

This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals.Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
You also get alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.

The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's more like riding a heavy cart up a hill. The split of the nucleus again, so some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.

Content theory focuses on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what's in certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.

This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary measures, making performance evaluations, delegating and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels like he has to change everything the team has done and do his own thing.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often ends in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as teams considered conventional, however there are some subtle differences.
The virtual team members usually act as the point of contact for your immediate physical group.
