I don't drink alcohol, you know.
There seems to be no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very annoyed by him.
Why should we help you?
I've implemented the plan.
He made a list.
For a while I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.
I think Tom is circling us.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Did you tell Tom why you want to go to Boston?
Tom and Mary have gone now.
The more the merrier.
She helped us.

It scared the hell out of him.
What are these things?
I need it.
Is your dog a German Shepherd?
We can fix anything.
She wants to buy her boyfriend a present.
I went to the beach with Tom and his friends.
Good luck with your exam.
You don't like fish either.
Will you go with them?

I'm sure the weather will be nice tomorrow.
I don't usually sleep at night.
I want to stay home and read a book.
I want Tom to like you.

I tried to call him.
Do you travel often?
My car is German.
I'm so happy Christmas is here.
I just need to get some rest.
She said she wasn't convinced.
I am totally satisfied with my new home.
Why do you study English every day?
I'd like to cross the United States of America in a convertible.
You won't find them there.
Your explanation is too abstract for me.
These monks live inside the monastery.
I just have to find him.
Can I see this?
He can speak Japanese.
I might be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
Tom will find a job soon enough.
Correct the underlined words.
Did you tell him you were joking?
Keep watching.
When the results are public, I'll let you know.
I wanted to go back to his village.
Tom is satisfied with his success.
You are reliable.
I didn't even consider it.
Better to have friends in the street than money in the register.
You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree with you 100%.
These flowers are not only beautiful but also have a good smell.
You're at the university now, aren't you?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember.
Tom said that he likes teaching French.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go and tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd mistake him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said Mary was short.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's very unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
You are depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?
It was all your imagination.
I'm not going to vote!
Why can't you do that?

Do you like Mary's new Halloween costume?
He found out the secret.
Don't give her ideas.
What's your favorite video game?
Sami's hands are perfect.
Kyoto is an extraordinarily beautiful city.
I can't accept this gift.
It'll be our secret.
It's going to happen soon.
I saw my sister there.
Why don't you try to fix it?
We've made far too many mistakes.
I hope to see you tomorrow.
What does this have to do with my family?
Let him stay at home if he wants to!
I've lived here for ten years.
I'd be happy to give you a ride.
He tried to get up early.
I like the blue.
They have a lot of different fish to try.
What's the difference between real diamonds and fake ones?
Could you call me back?
I'd like two copies of each of these documents.
I expect I'll have to do that for Tom.
What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen more powerful than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all going to die.
Tom kept crying.
I can't do that yet.
George was out of his mind with rage!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?
Poor people are also people with feelings.
I'm sure Tom is just trying to help.
You smell so good.
I forgot all about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm a mess.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
We can't let him die.
As far as I know, Tom is retired.
What time does he leave?
I usually drink a lot of milk.
With a smile, anything is possible.
I like strong black coffee.
He says nobody cares about that kind of thing.
Tom works for a bank.
I had three choices.
Tom and Mary won't be happy to see you here.
These goats are very friendly.
The two sisters are so similar that it is difficult to tell them apart.
Why don't koalas have an umbilical?
Please leave a message.
When was the last time you went online?
I played with Tony yesterday.
We can't let that happen.
The thief entered through a broken window.
How do you say "I love you" in your language?
It's on.
You look really pale.
Tom forgot about the milk.
That song sounds familiar.
Do you have any plaster?
I'm bringing some food to Tom.
I'd like to see some dancing.
I don't feel like eating now.
Wouldn't you like to eat?
Everyone knows you're rich.
I study at school.
What would Jesus do?
He says he hates studying Berber.
We need warm welcome and support.
His handwriting is illegible.
Let me finish my sentence.
I don't know about politics.
Have you ever read a book in French?
I'm not your angel anymore.
His leg was put in a cast.
The girl likes horses.
Your brother got married, didn't he?
Do you think Tom went to Australia?
Don't blame me for that.
Now, it's your turn.
You were confused.
You don't have to do this without permission.
I like your novel.
Who wrote the Bible?
You'll be ready.
We're not drinking.
I came home from school, then I went out with my friends.
I arrived at the station this morning.

You have osteoporosis.
You can tell her I said that.
I thought you were getting a divorce.
Look at that beautiful moon!

Now give me your hands.
I screamed.
Mary also likes bananas.
I'm a newbie, you know.
I want to meet them.
Tom is going to the mall.
Tom wants a large family.
Did you like it?
I should have stayed with her.
We're going to be friends forever.
I never stole anything.
Tom tried to ignore Mary.
I got home late last night.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll get home safe and sound.
Ask Tom if he'll attend the meeting.
I can't run a business. It's too hard for me.
Is she learning French?
Is that your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often up late.
I don't often eat bananas.
Get them out of here.
I've never seen them wear hats.
Do you know Tom?

Give me an ashtray, please.
Who found her?
What exactly did he say?
You need to go to the hospital.

I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

Fadil bought a house in Cairo.
They spent six months building the house.
The sky was gray.

I hate to say it, but Tom is right.
I already gave him your number.
Show me another watch.
You want to stop them?
You should have seen them run.
He and I were in the same camp at the time.
Tom doesn't know how much Mary loves him.
I think I'm being objective.
Tom hasn't warmed up his car yet.
I'll be happy to help you.
How long will you be staying?
This is intolerable.

He was talking to himself.
A $10,000 fine is nothing.
Take me away from here.
I really want to impress them.
What caused the accident?
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I think I've had too much to drink.
I wrote to ask why.

I don't like your hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I'm a student at the University of Hyogo.
We're going to run the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life was going smoothly.
No one wants to help us.
They speak very quickly.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there many sharks around here?
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
She's from Sweden.
He didn't have money to buy the farm.
You really believed that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with squid.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't that funny, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20th.
It's a good picture.
I'll leave you alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Does Tom work here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being so sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
She's being dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got irritated.
I'm old enough already.
I have a dirty record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought an English book at a bookstore.
Tomorrow I'm going to the bookstore to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody out of here.
Giant pandas only live in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say things like that.
From bad to worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You did good here.
Where'd all the others go?
I'm relaxed now.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He's intruding on her private life.
May I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom is still absent.
I ate all the apple.
Roast the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only cook Uyghur food.
We're leaving Boston in the morning.
We can't just leave you there.
Tom played football.
Stop your stuttering.
I know you.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday only comes once a year.
Put your bike away.
I took that as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
You don't seem too surprised.
I don't go to school on Saturdays.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom is treacherous, isn't he?
Is this cage supposed to protect you from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I played the trombone when I was younger.
I'm loyal to you.
Can you write in braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Step forward and get out of here.
You need to get more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
She's out of smoke.
I have no other choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
She's smarter than him.
What's he gonna do this summer?
He got irritated.
Can you speak Shanghai?
It shrunk because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what had happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
I'm in London, you know?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This is gonna make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
Who's your favorite female rapper?
Say hi to Tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving so early?
I'm pretty proud of that.
I can smell gas.
I'll tell them that's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
I happened to sit next to her at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who is the man playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He sleeps in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income on drinking.
Google it more and more!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does this look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Are they going to die?
I really like it.
Are you guys going in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When is your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good at it.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He promised to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I like to be right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give you 50,000 for this statue.
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please, tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I'm on the road almost every day.
I'm not going to apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's the key.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the car keys.
I don't really feel like talking.
So he must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken up.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of the American cuisine.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
It'll clear up this afternoon.
He went blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that painting?
How many continents are there in the world?
He's a good singer, right?
Tom is angry at Mary, isn't he?
Your idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom is getting emotional.
I was just scared.
It's a big day tomorrow.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I would like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy at the moment.
I appreciate your insight.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom likes fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We have to inform Tom.
Tom is still sleeping.
Tom is a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drums.
It must be warm.
Which online dictionary do you use the most?
You lit the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German cars are among the best.
Call them.
That's cool.
Tom doesn't respect Mary's opinions.
She plowed the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd get it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a pattern.
She brought me a cup of sugarless tea.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue down.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can pick whatever you want.
I'm in the hospital. I got struck by lightning.
Did you call them?
He turned off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
He's in the van.
I'm not introducing them.
Do you like golf?
Sorry to interrupt you the other day.
Can you believe this?
I waited for a bus to arrive.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.
I wasn't well.
You students are expected to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I can't drive very well.
I heard Tom is learning to drive.
You know I love you deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is that we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I cut the branch with an axe.
Miniskirts are back in style.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least at six.
I have a lot of work to do by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner, walk on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
She's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for over ten years.
We are grateful for the music he left us.
It's not that the idea of putting an ammonia appliance in my house appeals to me.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run after the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I just buy you a hat?
I thought Tom would show up.
She's pale to the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening to me, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom is my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountains?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on board.
You are charming.

The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why do these things always happen to me?
The birds are catching up.
The park is closed on Mondays.
You didn't even update the firmware?
I got a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do it now?
All my friends like them.
I like my language.
Why won't you answer me?
We are Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing his game.
Are you going in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
Your horse had a heart attack.
The ruins are worth a visit.
You should be prepared for the worst.
Tom took the suitcases out of the trunk.
That reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry. I can't eat this.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember his license plate number?
He lied to us.
She has seven children.
Let's hear some music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take him to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This happened to me.
He has a lot of friends in America.
I wasn't living in Boston last year.
Are you reading this book tonight?

Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
She turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door close.
He got him drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You are stubborn.
I'm not feeling nervous.
You have a nice dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you guys planning to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with his leap reached the quiet Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My father always gets involved in my personal life.
Everybody wants something different.
Tom refused to carry out the order.

I didn't know about his plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
How about a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Do Tom and Mary sing?
Are Tom and Mary okay?
Contracting is common in markets.
They shot him.
We're sorry to have inconvenienced you.

Money saved is money earned.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
She's gone through the red.
Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started acting weird.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You're being random.
Please turn the music down.
I'll train Tom for the job.
She watched him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.

Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children played together.
Say that again, please.
You're upsetting her.
Sami isn't here to ruin your day.
I took my shoes off.
I am learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?
The woman is drinking water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are very picky about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is cheap, it will close soon if the food doesn't taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight. I'm going to the gym.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You look relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it at a used store.
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's finally here!
Tom thinks everyone will be here by noon.
Why doesn't he work with me anymore?
It doesn't mean anything.
You're lying to me.
She helped him.
Everybody was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates clubs.
Go on home.

I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Finish the sentence.
The clock broke.
I'm not going to wait forever.
Just give the order.

She became famous.
What are you pointing at?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.

You are very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You are a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs a penny.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's have dinner tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture up.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June's not that far away either.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes got wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you guys gonna leave me?

Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me some questions?

This point will be discussed tomorrow.

You want me to be clear?
What are you gonna do?

You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
