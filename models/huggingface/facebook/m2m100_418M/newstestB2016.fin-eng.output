9-Year-Old Boy Found in Istanbul
Police have been searching for a 9-year-old boy on Tuesday afternoon in Tampere.
The disappearance announcement of the boy with his boyfriend from West Tampere has been spread on social media.
According to the police, the boy has been contacted and he is not at risk for his life and health.
The son's father told Lita-Sanom at midnight knowing that the son was found.
He’s okay and we’re going to start the post-examination.
The son was found in the neighborhood of the house, the father said.
Ronaldo is back in a row, scratching to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League in the weekend and continued his factory in the Champions League.
The struggle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goalkeeper turned at least for a moment to the last advantage.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goalkeeper statistics when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits of punishment and one of the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his March score to 80 when on Tuesday's Barcelona match he had a score of 77 goals.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has compurished in the Italian football league in Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in the Champions League D class it started strongly with a 2-1 victory over Manchester City.
The victory was made a few minutes before Juventus's final Alvaro Morata.
The city attack was bored by the absence of Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's election game, came to the field only in the last 10 minutes.
Also Manchester's second team United suffered hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering 1-2-tape.
ManU’s 20-year-old lawmaker Luke Shaw’s struggle lasted only a hour.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking scratch hit the scratch towards the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw'l is likely to be broken.
Shaw slept at the end of the Eindhoven home stadium for ten minutes before the medical staff went to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay brought the guests to 1-0 in the 41st minute, but ManU's pleasure lasted just a few minutes.
Moreno balanced before the break with an additional time.
PSV won in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season in the Champions League started by Paris Saint-Germain.
It was the Argentine Angel Di Maria who replaced Manchester United's shirt for PSG.
Di Maria broke through to the right and lifted the ball over the back corner of Malmö's painter Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been ranked among the successful seasons.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which belongs to the small leagues of the league, is not the best possible reference point.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsSKA lost 0-1 against Wolfsburg in the B-Lock match in Germany.
The opposition demanded immediate dismissal - the president made the wrong speech
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe made the same speech he had held a month ago.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has repeatedly held the same speech in the country's parliament in the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe obviously did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full life.
The MDC has called for Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants hurried to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe’s headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed before and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria call for an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Chairman of the European Council, Donald Tusk, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to make Europe more effectively registered.
According to Merkel, negotiations on asylum quotas are on the table of the Ministers of the Interior.
Professor acknowledges he has shot his girlfriend
University professor Shannon Lamb called for a voice of a slightly shouting police at his home and said he shot his girlfriend.
Lambly mentioned that their beloved dog was in place and alive and probably scared. The professor told the family that the contact details of the dead woman were in the woman's phone.
From inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message on the white paper: "I'm very sorry and I hope I can cancel my act. I loved Amya, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," Lamb's signed letter read according to the authorities.
There were no signs in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University in Mississippi, Cleveland, had already travelled 500 kilometers from the school campus. Police found at the campus at the door of his workroom the dead-thanced historian professor Ethan Schmidt, who Lamb believes to have shot.
Lynn Buford, police chief at Delta State University, said the university officials were informed of the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb called a fatal emergency call a while after that.
One day, another death occurred.Lamb killed himself when the police approached him.
The day after the shooting, students and teachers stood closely behind closed doors, and the authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motives.
The researchers explored the details at both locations, and Lamb's acquainted teachers told them about the man. The researchers had a picture of a talented but problematic teacher.
Students said they were always looking forward to the professor's hours.
According to police officers from Prentice's location of death, the professor had no previous evidence of violence or crime.
Schmidt, in turn, had mentioned it in his book by Lamb, in which he had given recognition to "they people" with whom he was given to spend his academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with a teaching staff of 17 people. Many of the students participated in both male courses.
References to the problems, however, arose.
Lambia’s glorious student Brandon Beavers said that the professor seemed accelerated and nervous, “as if he had something wrong.”
Another student Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 academic year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously announced a medical leave from the Delta State University due to some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s wage policy meant that the argument for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
University director William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lambia was clearly worried with something.
These questions can no longer be answered.
After leaving the campus, the police found out what route Lamb had arrived from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had killed himself with a 38-caliber pistol at the back of the house in Mississippi, Greenville, about a half-kilometer away from the home of his parents, the Washington County death investigator Methel Johnson said.
Lamb’s car was still on the road.
The police did not immediately find out why Lamb had gone to that house, but Johnson said he believed the man knew the residents of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started his work as a teacher of geography and education at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He received a doctoral degree in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longest-lasting friends described this as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me that she met through Lamb's common friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20 years old.
She was with her friends still at school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried for years to teach Hairston guitar.
“Lamb was a heartbreaker at that time.
All the girls were on her side,” said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently met for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but no document says they have been arrested.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a tired house on the river in the small town of Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
Prince's former husband Shawn O'Steen told me that he divorced Prince 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
“He was quite shocked,” O’Steen said about his daughter.
My mother and daughter were the best friends.
O'Steen hadn't met Lambi but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both appeared on the summer event three years ago.
Sometimes they also played together.
O'Stein says his daughter is composing and performing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a barmaker and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room outside Gautier, said they saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, when Lamb had played guitar and a mouth shock for a few audiences.
Nothing refused that something was wrong.
“Happy couple,” Shaffer said.
“We walked together.
Both had a good sense of humor.”
"The deceased professor Schmidt was guiding the first year seminars and was specialized in the history of the Indian and Colonial Age," said English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
She was married and had three children.
He studied Emporia at the State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his own brotherhood and college.
The Delta State University campus in Cleveland has 900 people gathered for a memorial in a candle light. The teaching staff, other staff, students and the residents of the area were involved.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the night event, where the university's chore presented the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get the students back,” LaForge said.
“The crisis is over.
This is a healing day.”
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi’s Cleveland.
Assistant journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagster Cheats in Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police now say that Lamb called an emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt. Additionally, it was noted that although Lamb referred to his wife in the emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. The toy and baby product retailer, however, says it offers its current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity for additional hours of work.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews for applicants will begin this month, and new employees will begin in October-December.
Although there are still months for the holiday season, the trade season is approaching a good pace, and companies are preparing by hiring temporary labor for stores as well as for the shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox laughes on his "treff" with Princess Diana
Return to the Future was an important moment for Michael J. Fox’s career.
The next day was of personal importance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. I was told that Princess Diana is coming to me," Fox said in the coming Back in Time document trailer.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very similar to the deals with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time documentary is linked to The Return to the Future, and the documentary also interviews Fox with Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The film “Return to the Future” was released 30 years ago.
“This movie is definitely for me a time travel film of all time,” Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be released in VOD and DVD formats, and will be presented in selected cinema from October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, commented on Russia’s intensified war actions and said there is no military solution to the almost five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite their forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said he intended to meet with the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Ban regretted that the dissolution of the Security Council, the people of Syria and the regional powers have caused a situation that is impossible to solve.
Ban called on five permanent member states to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis as the Iran nuclear deal was achieved.
8 Chapter on Support Questions: Is Donald Trump Serious?
Trump has been described as an empty speaker.
He was also considered a joke.
Some predicted Trump’s collapse.
The Republican circles have (until now) made any effort without a result to pull Trump down from the gallup.
Ten of the eleven national gallups show Donald Trump two-number support numbers. Some are already seriously thinking about what it practically tells about the possibilities of the real estate assembly.
The elections are just in the early stages.
It has not yet been announced that Trump will be elected as a Republican candidate.
Experts remind that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was in the gallup race, was allowed to give room to the rising Herman Cain.
For many reasons, it would be difficult for Trump in the general election.
External groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth have noted Trump’s strong position and started mining his image of his fall.
The following fresh gallup data indicates that the real estate volume cannot be ignored by the possibility:
Trump’s support has been a full translation.
Just before Trump announced that he would be a candidate in mid-June, according to the Gallup of the University of Monmouth, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive image of the real estate.
By mid-July, 40 percent had a positive opinion.
At the beginning of August, the proportion was 52%.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of ten views are negative.
These numbers are also kept in the states where elections are held first.
In the last week’s Quinnipiac Golf, 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republicans would be pleased with Trump's candidacy.
In a gallup between CNN and ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were very pleased or satisfied with Trump's potential election as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson receives almost the same enthusiastic reception as Trump (43 percent would be very pleased with Carson’s candidacy and 40 percent with Trump’s candidacy).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a corresponding contribution of 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush was elected as a party candidate.
The majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for power accuracy and offensive comments. 52 percent of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the real estate bull as suitable for the president.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the party meeting is held first: according to the Quinnipiac Gallup, 52 percent of Republicans consider Trump’s personal characteristics suitable for the Supreme Chief of Defence.
However, according to ABC and Post’s gallup, 44 percent believe that Trump will not be able to function effectively, and six out of ten believe Trump’s temperament is incompatible with the White House.
The Republicans begin to get used to the thought.
They begin to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a party candidate, according to CNN and ORC’s gallup, four out of ten believe in Trump’s possibilities.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
The Republicans have not previously had a very reliable crystal ball in their use.
At this point in the last election, four of the ten Republicans considered Rick Perry as a likely candidate, and only 28 percent considered Mitt Romney.
The majority seems to see Trump’s campaign as convincing.
Although the Republicans would support another candidate, Trump covers almost all other candidates.
Some experts believe that the split camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump’s opponents are divided into the supporters of different candidates.
The Monmouth University opinion survey in early September revealed that in the imaginary twist between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would get a greater support for him almost always.
He leads Carly Fiorino with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
With Ted Cruise, he’s on the level.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson won Trump with 19 points in a fictional battle.
A small majority of Trump’s supporters say they’ve already made a vote.
According to a gallup released on Tuesday by CBS and NYT, just half of Trump’s supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for many reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump’s supporters did not make a final decision.
Trump's very competitor at this moment is the neurochirurgist Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidate are twice more likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump’s view of immigration.
In his campaign speech, Donald Trump called migrants rape from Mexico two months ago as a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s powerful speeches will throw important Latin American voters out of the Republican gangs and hinder the brand’s reform.
According to the ABC News and the Washington Post on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are in immigration issues on the same lines as Trump.
As long as migration is in light, so is Donald Trump.
The dissatisfaction with the government is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting approximately half of the Republican votes.
The Republicans want a fresh face to be a candidate instead of a political conqueror, according to the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, this opinion was made by six out of ten Republicans.
These two candidates are also enthusiastic to Washington.
According to a poll by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the Republicans' action in Congress: 54 percent are dissatisfied and 21 percent on the edge of anger."
Jeremy Corbyn debuts with Prime Minister's query
After the elections, Corbyn's first visit to the Prime Minister's query is expected with enthusiasm.
Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour’s new image, is scheduled to rise for the first time to measure his strength at David Cameron’s query hours later.
Corbyn raises the first of his six questions a little after half a day. Media and Labour Party representatives follow the man's eye hard.
Corbyn has tracked less theatre and added fact to the weekly show.
He also said he could leave some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn is under a parliamentary test now after the meeting of the Shadow Government and the Corbyn’s Central Organization of Trade Unions (TUC)’s annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to silence during the National Song on the 75th anniversary of the British Climate War on Tuesday has received criticism from several representatives of the Tory Party. The silence has also ended in the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national song attracted attention
Corbyn's representative stated that Corbyn was standing during the National Song in silence respecting the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Corbyn's Shadow Government member Owen Smith told BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have called on the party leader to join the national song despite the rejection of this monarchy.
Ten secretaries have refused to go to Corbyn's first team, calling for disputes in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than six percent of the parties initially supported Corbyn's election to party leadership.
BBC's policy exchanger Robin Brant believes that political disagreements about Britain's EU membership and the government's striking conditions for granting benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party after Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that Labour intends to propose changes to eliminate the restrictions completely.
A few hours later, the Secretary of Labor and Pension of the Shadow Government Smith said that the party’s position is very clear: it only opposes the government’s plans to cut the border from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has met over the past decade in the leadership of the Tory Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a new approach to policy, says he has chosen questions to Cameron from the 30,000 proposals he has received from the public.
According to Corbyn, who was elected from the Islington North electoral district, there are too many interrogations in the questionnaire, he also promises to avoid narrow speech and lionish and says he will instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has stated that the Secretary of State Angela Eagle will visit him for interrogations, for example when Cameron is on a foreign trip.
Corbyn has also thrown into the air the idea that others may also occasionally come to the vote. he tells he has discussed the matter with the President of the House of Representatives John Bercow.
Upon Corbyn's rise to the party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a doll-themed policy, which is often linked to the questionnaire.
Since the survey was broadcast for the first time in 1990, it has been considered a key measure of the leadership’s criticism, sub-room management and status. According to critics, however, the survey has become a cartoon that requires considerable reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": homeless young photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for homeless people.
For the group of former streets, there has been a meaningful way to learn and earn.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit photography studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their homeland and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young man who has graduated through the project among the first.

Punta to Rise in UK Wages
Punta was stronger as wages rise in the UK, and SABMiller pushed the FTSE 100 index to rise.
In May-July, wages increased 2.9% in the UK compared to the same period last year.
The fastest growth is expected since 2009.
Punta was consolidated by 1 percent, and its rate was noted at $1.5505. Punta was also consolidated in proportion to the euro, and was noted at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose 1.49 percent and ended to 6.229.21 points.
The biggest rise was made by SABMiller, whose rate dropped by 20 percent when the company received a preliminary purchase offer from a competitive company AB InBev.
When the trade was implemented, it would unite two of the world’s largest pipe companies and distribute under the same roof brands including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share increased by 0.9 percent in the wave of the competitive Richemont Group’s positive outcomes focused on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast. sales developments were a rise point also on Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore’s shares increased by 5 percent as the mining residents announced they intend to collect $2.5 billion in shares as part of their debt reduction strategy.
Packaging and Paper Group Mond's shares were the highest in their fall of 4.3 percent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's shares price for sale purposes.
The JD Sports rate increased by 3.1 per cent after the sports company was informed that its earnings before taxes will rise from 83 per cent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports Pomo: Higher wages could hinder the expansion
Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Group, said a minimum wage increase in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not enough to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
According to Cowgill, an increase in labour costs may compromise JD Sport’s expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash Launches Grass Root Campaign Against Aldi's Wreck
Metcash is seeking to safeguard its IGA store from the domination of Aldi in South and West Australia.
Food wholesale Metcash has launched a grain root campaign to preserve the IGA retail market share in South and West Australia against the 700 million Australian dollar invasion of Aldi.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centers and the first up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand by marketing in mass media and social media and by organizing events like the Adelaide show.
For example, the IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, the Simmo ice cream factory in Dunsborough offers flavours in the IGA stores, and merchants sell tickets to local customers for the South Australian Football League games at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed data on its defense strategy on September 29, when the Food, Alcohol and Iron Trade Box is organizing the annual Investment Strategy Day.
This is a significant market, as South and West Australia make up 30 percent of the footprint of Metcash IGA stores, and in these regions the cover profit is greater than the IGA stores network in the eastern states.
Consumers in South and West Australia are known for their corner orientation, and IGA traders have a significantly greater market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. in South Australia the market share is 30 percent and in West Australia the market share is 24 percent, while in the eastern states the market share is only 14 percent.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will hit 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA traders will be sold for $360 million and Metchas will be sold for $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will surpass 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in sales in these regions.
Metcash' fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can indicate a loss of $13 million in the result before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses its market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan’s recent study says IGA’s customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales will decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2018.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group’s chief portfolio manager Hamish Douglass said at an event held in Melbourne that he believes it is very likely that Metcash will disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public opinion on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash government contacted Douglas last week.
The IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent, and the result of the food business of Metcash serving 1200 IGA retailers has decreased by 43 percent from the 2012 level.
However, the wholesale operator takes counteraction and makes a yearly deposit of more than $150 million in response to the prices of Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products per week. The chain wants to support traders in refining stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food range of the trade's own brands.
Metcash CEO Ian Morricen said the price review and shops reform plans are in good pace, and the company will be able to rebound its profits in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian tennis union chairman Steve Healy defends Thanas Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special advertisement of his behavior instead of criticism.
Australian tennis union chairman Steve Healy says Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a side victim in a recent Nick Kyrgios jupak.
The younger side of the "Special K" duo, Kokkinakis, was in a disadvantaged light condition when the bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the ATP tournament in Montreal.
Soon after that, in a carcass match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the judge had to separate the competitors twice. "Wawrinkan should have been given back to Kyrgiosis and my friend," Harrison said.
In the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis hit frustratedly his mile field as strong cramps broke his match. Healy has loyally defended Kokkinak.
Currently, the teen star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth from the single-playing duel behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the United Kingdom.
"I strongly believe that Thanas has been pulled out according to the dispute," Healy said.
“He broke the medal when he lost the match at the US Open. He’s not the first player to break the medal because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he’s not proud of his work.
However, he has suffered very well, for example, Harrison's provocative behavior in the US Open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a brilliant horse around him. I think he has only been treated slightly unfairly.
He’s very mature at the age of 19, he’s working hard and complements the team well. He’s never had any problems with other players, and he’s respected among the players. He’s exercising hard, he’s in good condition and really stable and mature young man. I think he should be assessed on the basis of his own marines.”
Healy also supported the decision to withdraw Kyrgios from the Australian team as a succession from an important round that begins. Healy describes the solution as a common decision that works for all parties. However, he supports Canberra's educator's return to the team as a long-term consolidation.
“First of all, we want to focus completely on matches instead of polemics related to Kyrgyzstan,” Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have noted, the young man has to grow up in the light of the public. He deserves the criticism he has received for his sad mistakes. However, we try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to organize his own peace. I believe that it is the best for both the whole team and Nick."
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary, which declared an emergency state, closed its southern border toward Serbia on Tuesday and captured illegal immigrants.
The border caused chaos when hundreds of migrants gathered to the country, and Serbian authorities reacted angry.
People who escaped from violence were forced to stay on the road gap between the country’s inspection stations in their tents for an indefinite time.
The frustration began to rise to the surface.
When a police helicopter flies in the air above the migrants, they scream "Open the border!" and scream off the Hungarian police.
Some protested for eating and drinking.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs said he would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrives from Macedonia and Greece.
“Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase damage.
The situation will be discussed in the coming days in Brussels and also in other countries,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The meeting on the border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when a group of 28 states failed in their attempts to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed that the responsibility for the flood of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is common. The meeting raised the hope that by the next month or by the end of the year there will be an agreement on which EU Member States will receive 120,000 migrants, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria have called for an additional summit for the next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not hope for immediate action from Brussels or neighboring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that in two southern regions the authorities were able to use more effective means, i.e. closing the roads and accelerating the legal processes in asylum matters.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated that Hungary is also planning a pickland hill to the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction now that the hill on the Serbian border is already ready.
Charlie D'Agata, a letter exchange for CBS News, that even prisoners participated in the tender competition for the finishing of the pickel-like work between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear boundary for migrants and a transit point to the European Union. Many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and elsewhere from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of the people arriving are lifestyles refugees, not war refugees, who have the right to seek security.
In Hungary, according to the new law, which came into force at midnight, it is a crime to exceed or damage a four-metre high square, which the government has built on the southern border in the direction of Serbia.
“Because of the situation caused by the mass change, the government declares the country a crisis state,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
“We follow a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime.”
In practice, the parliament still has to approve military actions, which is expected next week. Associated Press news agency journalists on the border have seen heavy-armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Orban’s internal security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said the authorities have captured 45 border crossing attempted at the border and 15 further.
The people who have been hurt through the border are now in the police’s possession.They are accused of crimes under new laws.
The authorities will repair it quickly.
Furthermore, Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing sites on the border of Serbia on Tuesday. One border crossing site was closed by a trains covered with a stick.
Caos took over the main border crossing site near Roszke in Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal container to the point where people packed into.
Around 20 were able to enter, but thousands were left outside.
Another group of immigrants closed the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary. People said they were in food and drink ban until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership cut by side against Bernie Sanders, according to national gallup
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s support rate is still two-number in the Democratic National Candidate’s struggle, but Senator Bernie Sanders has dropped the gap to the end.
Clinton’s support is now 47 percent of the votes of the Democratic leaders (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent of the votes (up from 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential election; his support among Democrats is 15 percent.
More than five months before the pre-election, it is too early for most Democrats to tell which candidate they support.
However, Clinton’s supporters are the supporters of other candidates more confident in their choice.
After the CBS News gallup last month, Clinton has lost the support of several Democratic groups, while Sanders' camp has joined new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong leadership position among women and moderates, but the leadership has fallen down.
Clinton's support among men has fallen significantly, and he's only five percent off against Sanders.
Clinton has lost its leadership among the Democrats under the age of 50 and is now on the level with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a clear advantage among the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton's advance in the stakes against Sanders among the liberals was two-number, but now Sanders has taken five-percent points in the neck to Clinton in this group.
Approximately half of the Democrats say they will support Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
The quarter would support Clinton with the smallest reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he is a candidate.
6 percent would not support Clinton.
It is no surprise that the current supporters of Clinton would be enthusiastic supporters even if he was elected as a candidate.
There is more discretion in the views among those who are currently not in favor of Clinton. Only about a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
Only 35 percent of the Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
When Clinton’s voters are asked to freely describe why they support his candidacy, the most popular argument is Clinton’s right experience (16 percent). Second, the most popular answer is that it’s time to choose a female president (13 percent) and third, that Clinton is the best candidate for his post (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention his contact with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, it is mentioned the unified views and the chances of winning real elections.
The Vice-President is still pointing on his possible candidacy, and 57 percent of the Democrat voters would expect him to join the competition.
When the Democratic voters question the second most popular candidate to be a party candidate, the majority will choose Biden.
Over half of Clinton’s supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn’t go to the Democratic Candidate, Hillary Clinton will increase its advance against Sanders. When Sanders is involved, the advance will be 20 percent points, and it will increase to 30 percent points if Sanders doesn’t go to the Candidate.
55% of Democrats consider Clinton to be a candidate with the best chances of winning real elections, but the share has dropped from 78% last month.
Twelve-year-old Biden is far from Clinton, but more and more people believe Biden's chances of winning real elections.
Democratic voters, however, consider opinions on issues more important than candidates’ chances of winning.
The voters don’t think that any candidate or candidate is unacceptable.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates as suitable for their characteristics.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, reliable, and leaders.
Biden is most often characterized as honest, while Clinton is most often considered a type of leader.
Up to 30 percent of Democrats don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while 15 percent don’t know if Sanders is honest.
Democrats think Clinton, Sanders and Biden’s views are close to the voters’ own ideology.
For all the features, about a quarter has no opinion about Sanders.
When voters are asked about the views of Hillary Clinton’s private email and her own server as a foreign minister, most Democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton’s explanation and it has not changed the views of these voters about Clinton.
The Americans are widerly disagreed.
Half of the Americans are unhappy with Clinton’s conclusion, and only a third are satisfied.
People's opinions divided in March, when the clarification was just revealed.
Most Americans believe that the controversial use of email has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say that the picture has changed to a negative direction.
Of these 36 percent, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although voters in their own party consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, it is possible to improve these features when asked the views of all voters: Clinton is honest and trustworthy by only 32 percent, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55 percent of all voters in the country don’t think Trump is honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump get good values on leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
The majority considers Sanders honest, but as with Carson, many don’t have a opinion about Sanders.
The survey has 351 voters and the error margin of the survey is 6 percent points.
Ben Carson holds Donald Trump's front trip in a national support query
According to a recent CBS News and New York Times survey, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates drove more than half of the votes in the new survey, and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters throughout the country, Trump still has a strong support. The support share has risen before Fox News' last month's debate from the CBS's 23 percent survey.
However, Carson’s support would hit a sharp rise over the same period, from 6 percent to 23 percent.
According to the survey, Carson has a strong support in all populations. In the group of Higher Education, he is steadily suppressing Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich will remain far away. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is the weakest and has fallen from last month 10 percent to now 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio split the third place with 6 percent support.
The error margin in the 376 Republican voters survey is 6 percent in the direction or in the other.
According to CNN and ORC’s latest survey last week, Carson’s support is rising, with 19 percent of Republicans supporting him, while Trump’s support is 32 percent.
Also in the latest survey by ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
During the last week’s men’s meeting, Trump raised unreliable accusations to a retired neurochirurgist, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump’s belief.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday during his campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the department accused of the death of Baruch Colleg
Nearly two years ago, after the murder of a student in the department's ritual at the Pocon River in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Baruch College (City University of New York) members of the Pi Delta PS department harassed the Chun "Michael" Deng in the castle held in September 2013. Police said the department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was believed to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were bound, his back was placed with a almost 15-kg sand-filled reef and his touch was repeatedly passed on his attempt to reach the object that was placed on the other side of the ice field.
Deng is to have first chosen headaches and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, members of the Pi Delta PS department didn’t call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness. They claimed to have waited an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
Police Secretary Chris Wabner said at a press conference that the members would change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms and contact department chairman Andy Meng.
“At this stage, members began to hide the tools by putting the department’s interests ahead of Michael Deng’s health,” Wagner said.
Dengue was not rescued, and he died the next morning.
According to the body opening protocol, Dengi had been hit several times in the head, upper body and travel with a boring object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the department's simulation, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the simulation since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer for the Deng family, said in a statement.
The departments and their members shall take responsibility where the authorities must take an important step.
A large jury of the district of Monroe presented five members of the district to be accused of a third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the department are charged with fraud and criminal conspiracy. among the accused are also Meng.
“We want to get the responsibility not only by individuals, but also by a formally or informally accepted organization,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College put the department on a ban, and the national department resigned from the local department.
How the U.S. Central Bank (Fed) increases interest rates
The rise of interest rates and the rise of the stock markets are shrinking, the return of securities is rising and the economy is sliding down.
We know that.
We don’t know how long it takes and how long the effects will last.
Especially in terms of economics, we find history referring to the timing.
The Lama has arrived in up to 11 months after the first interest rise and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, though not always. The decisive factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, the central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors should not pay attention to when the interest rates start, but to how long it will take to normalize the situation.
Of course, there are a number of variables.
In the end, however, market operators may notice that any dive related to the rise of interests may be exaggerated.
“The central bank’s first rise after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the expiration of cheap money,” said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual normalization of interest to a fairly low level. It is a scary standing shock for many.
However, this does not mean that there is no effect.
Here are examples based on historical trends of how the effects can appear in the different aspects of the economy:
As the market has been seen for about a month, the rise of interest enteily can increase the instability for some time.
When interest rates finally rise, the impact is not so dramatic.
“The trend appears to be that capital interest rates remain stagnant after the first rise for 12 to 24 months, which is likely to reflect a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank’s analyst said in a recent study of the consequences of the rise.
Over the course of 35 years, the market is generally seen at the time of the rise of interest at a sharp rise, about 14 percent, quite stable in the next 250 days (the average rise of 2.6 percent), 500 days after the situation normalizes, and the average interest rate after six shares ratio is 14.4 percent, says Bob Doll, the chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's newspaper.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares will usually increase in a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest rates begin to decrease.
Lama is a fact in the economy, but the rise of the interest rates is generally pushing to it.
In this case, if the central bank faces the circumstances that had not existed before and that could accelerate the invoicing process.
It is remarkable that the GDP is at the lowest level ever, with the aim of raising the control rate of the central bank.
According to the Deutsche Bank, at the rise of 118 royal interest rates since 1950, only twice the nominal value was below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 appeared to be 3.6 percent, many did not imagine it would be sustainable, and in the third quarter it was 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
The rise of interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation can be a risk and can be questioned whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
On the market players have talked about the rise of the control rate throughout the year, and the views will turn to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves an increase in this meeting, future trading shows only a 25% chance.
“In our studies since 1950, all the rise cycles to this day have been in a super cycle, where the GDP that falls before the rise rate rises very quickly after the rise rate begins,” the report states.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst slam of the cycle.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last fall. The record had been 35 months, now it is already going to the 74th month.
Also, fixed income securities have been unstable in the end of the market interest rate, and the formula is also repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the rate.
In the case of joint bonds, the revenue appears to change the direction immediately as the first rise/rise cycle starts.
At the end of the rise cycle, revenue will decline immediately,” Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the interest rate will bring long- and short-term bonds to approach each other and the curve to balance.
“High-performance bonds often do better in such a environment, even though we’re still cautious in terms of revenue,” said Kathy Jones, Schwab’s fixed-performance securities analyst.
Interesting yes, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future direction of the central bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already a number of signs of adaptation to the strengthened financial policy," Jones says.
The short-term interest rates are rising, the output gap is straight, the credit risk margins are expanding and volatility is increasing. Everything is typical of the market in a situation where the central bank strikes its policy.
Overall, companies that operate mainly on the U.S. market will benefit as interest rates fall and local products begin to attract.
The prospects of debt-backed multinational companies are weaker, as the strengthening of the dollar causes their products to boil on the global markets and the debt to boil.
“History shows that quality shares are more profitable than interest rates in the next three months,” Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet lowered underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying underlying.
Companies with high capital yields and shares with low volatility also dealt with their quality better, with an average of 4 and respectively 3 percentage points better.
“The kingdom is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of the variable rate debt are losing the most,” Goldman said.
Outside of the stock market, consumers generally benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from a higher yield. Experts do not agree on how quickly the effects will appear.
Parliamentary Member Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
The conservative Andrew Bingham criticizes the radio station for its excessive popularization.
According to Bingham, it is difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitor today.
The BBC Music Awards is only a copy of the Brits.
Parliamentary Deputy Damien Collins accuses The Voice of personality.
According to a major parliamentary statement, BBC Radio 3 is gradually transformed into a copy of the Classic FM channel. The accusations add pressure to the station to prove that it offers more commercial radio stations each.
The conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the broadcasting company’s radio channel is becoming too populistic and it is no longer just separating the channel from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 feels like changing in the direction of the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards, which took place in December, also received criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, held last year for the first time, affects a copy of the British Awards.
These two are examples that, instead of new and different, we only travel what is already on the market,” Bingham says.
The chief executive of the BBC denied the accusations and said that the BBC Radio 3 offers more live music and exciting content to the commercial competitor.
"Radio 3: I learned from classical music something I can't learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to live music and making music is exactly in its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to searching for new music and ordering new works,” the CEO said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey said that the position needs to work more hard to maintain public interest, as the British know more of classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel that has been criticized by the hard entrance to the revir of commercial channels, in consultation with a limited cultural, media and sports committee.
Tory Parliamentary Deputy Damien Collins criticized The Voice's ability search competition, which BBC bought from a Dutch producer from Talpa Media.
"The program is hardly discussed because it is not unique or distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the BBC1 show, whose star judges are the Fire Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way for the BBC.
Moreover, Collins asked the company to look for a hit program in its own store when it next time launched a new entertainment series.
However, Collins did not agree to exclude that the The Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers’ money would be used for other entertainment formats.
The slowest online trade growth of all time in August – probably the cause of Black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online trading increased by 7%.
Online sales have been statistical since 2000. last month the growth was the slowest ever.
Three years ago, the Internet market increased with mobile manufacturing.
Experts believe that the black Friday in November can mitigate purchases.
Over a decade, the conquest of online commerce has devastated many of the UK’s shopping routes.
According to experts, there are indications that online trading is in balance, and new sales figures show only a 7 percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the overall sales growth was the slowest during the time when online sales were statisticed, i.e. since 2000. last year, online sales grew by only five percent.
According to experts, there are indications that online trading is in balance, and new sales figures show only a 7 percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If we compare last year’s growth to what we read in 2000, it’s clear that the growth will slow down over time,” IMRG’s chief reporter Andy Mulcahy told The Guardian.
Mulcai said the e-commerce was accelerated three years ago when consumers accepted mobile shopping.
"Thro this, more and more people were able to buy on the internet, and many were able to buy in different environments, by home hand.
As mobile manufacturing is more moderate now, growth can be more balanced.”
Black Friday is a phenomenon that is considered to be one of the reasons for slowing growth.
According to experts, the theme day celebrated on the last Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone their purchase decision before the Black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online buyers compared to the normal resulted in the collapse of many traders’ websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, which causes consumers to look after the offers, can mitigate purchasing losses over the other time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair pound per five pounds was consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, are purchased in online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of fashion stores.
In Mecca, victims of crashes are buried, Bin Laden's family is responsible
The Muslims put the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the largest construction company, Saudi Binladin Group, is partly concerned with the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were injured.
The bodies were carried in high air when Muslims gathered to burial the 29 victims of the crash on the Great Mosque of Mekka.
A crowd of people in white clothes had gathered to say goodbye to the victims on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
Sursaatue walked to a pilgrimage place where the collapse of the building was just a day earlier penetrated through the roof of the mosque over the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia has claimed that Bin Laden’s family business is responsible for the crash in which more than 394 people were injured.
The bodies of 29 people killed in a mass shooting were transported on the streets.
After the fall of the Nostur, among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, the Grand Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents, who were starting their annual hajj pilgrimage journey.
Saudi authorities have promised that the hajj pilgrimage will be organized as thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, Binladin Group would not have been allowed to leave the nostur tree up when the nostur was not used.
According to a news release in Arabic, Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The news agency's English-language service did not report the matter in detail. according to the English-language information, however, the group's management was prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the fall of the Nostur on the Grand Mosque. Thousands of Muslims are going to the Grand Mosque for a hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any information about the crash, nor has the group’s representatives been reached for a statement.
King also accused the group of failing to comply with the current security regulations and collaborating with meteorological experts.
A dozen lifts surround the Great Mosque of Mekka as part of Binladin Group’s giant construction project.
Bin Laden’s family has been closely connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades, and Bin Laden is responsible for several major construction projects.
Al Qaeda’s dead leader, Osama bin Laden, was a lawyer who had been abandoned by the family in the 1990s.
The crash occurred just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in his life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still hospitalized.
The authorities ordered a million rials (approximately €250,000) to be paid to victims’ relatives and permanently disabled persons.
The other injured will receive half of the compensation.
B&Q says the low-cost workforce in Eastern Europe is behind the phenomenon
The British are employing home general men more and more, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has increased by skilled, professional workers coming from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores are opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.

The British said they would transfer the house's paintings and paintings to the creators coming from Eastern Europe.
Painting and painting skills seem to be very few today.
Nowadays, the British are increasingly employing household generalists to carry out household nickelwork, B&Q’s head of the company says.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a home repair equipment store chain. According to Laury, the background of the phenomenon is from Eastern Europe coming skilled workers who offer services at high prices.
As a result of the phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders, while 60 B&Q stores are closed.
Laury needs more women’s workforce in the B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the stores are made by women.
At present, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, it is worth paying attention to the population trends, as today more and more single women also repair their homes.
“The staff of our stores is increasingly the majority of men,” Laury says.
“We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of products are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of five women who are in the succession of companies belonging to the UK FTSE 100 Index. She has also reorganized the company's management team so that men and women's leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only one in its quality, as 50 percent of its staff are women, including the executive and financial director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
"It has not been difficult to find good women in the leadership team."
Kingfisher's half-year business profits and sales rates have fallen, although the company was working hard after the shutdown of stores.
Kingfisher responds to the current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government of the three axes decided to resort to compulsory legislation to save the country’s economy.
The effects were seen quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other wage recipients center organizations began to force the same way and as a result, the country stood on Friday due to a large demonstration by workers.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
The question is whether it is worth the strike if it goes badly.
A resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people on the internet have already announced that they are not planning to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In a good old time, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring a corrupt would have been a political suicide of a small man.
Millions of members of professional organizations with a few tens of thousands of people protest not a lot of moment, but the reason of thinking it gives.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was a couple of years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement for themselves, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the action of the Ay movement, the government’s limited solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
After years have shown things to rule on their own weight, then now, finally, in the alliances, the matter is reached, i.e. the rights of the worker to defend, visible and properly.
The government could thus want to possibly suspend the role of the Ay movement, when membership in the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
No matter what the organizations think about the action, it’s a shit that Friday’s demonstration will somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has decreased for 31 months in a row.
GDP continues to decrease and unemployment increases.
I think that would force everyone’s head.
To the University of Lappeenranna a hard savings curve: With the goal of 8,5 million savings, staff will be reduced by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenrana is launching a savings curriculum, which aims to get the costs covered by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start the entire staff on YT negotiations with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reduction of about 130 employees.
The rest of the work is to save more than 2 million.
The YT negotiations are on the background of the 2016 budget, which forecasts the actual activity to be a deficit of 8.5 million.
This also affects the government’s funds.
During this financial year, the university will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
The expenditure will grow slightly for the next year, but the funding from the ministry will be reduced by 2 million and the rest of the funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university’s total budget is approximately 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10 percent of the total budget.
The interaction between the massive cuts on teaching and research and the decrease in corporate funding in our university is extremely significant, says Professor Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decrease in supplementary funding appears in new dimensions.
The negotiations with trust men will begin on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Onnibus wants Finnish railways
Onnibus’s owner, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Ylle that the company is also aimed at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in the Finnish railway transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, Souter says.
Railways are open to competition gradually.
The first is the near-city transportation of the capital region in the years 2017-2018.
After the distance, there is distant transportation.
Souter says he has already approached the transport ministry.
According to the Ministry of Transport, Onnibus plans are welcomed.
Other international companies have their interests in rail transport, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which has both bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
U.S. Central Bank's time of interest
The U.S. Central Bank (Fed) meeting will be held on Wednesday and Thursday to decide on a possible interest rate rise for the first time in almost a decade.
Approximately half of the economists who believed the central bank would raise the interest rates last week are now reducing the central bank’s current interest rate at 0–0.25 percent, according to a Reuters survey by 80 economists.
“This is a historic situation, as the central bank has kept the interest rate feeling zero for seven years.
For the first time we approach a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus start the normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought billions of additional dollars to the balance sheet and accelerated only a little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation that is not the same pink.
It has urged the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is scheduled to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 Central European Time.
Delta State University shooters apologize
After shooting her girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting a colleague later on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologizes for the first murder and hopes to be able to cancel it, the authorities said on Tuesday.
In Mississippi's Gautier, the Delta State University's geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called the emergency number around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot a man.
In an emergency call, Lamb asked the police to go home.
"I killed my wife yesterday night," Lamb said. She also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is not harmful to anyone but who is probably afraid.
The police asked the caller's name, but the man didn't tell it.
He also said no reason for the shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a letter written by Lamb, which read: "I am very sorry and I hope I can cancel my act.
I loved Amya, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to the Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before being killed late on Monday when police reached him.
University director William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lambia was clearly worried with something.
On Monday it was that Lamb was supposedly believing that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but the authorities on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the triumph.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married for seven years with Prentiss, described his former wife as a good man.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter that is shocked.
My mother and daughter were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, Prentiss' close friend Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home to hand.
Knowles stated that Prentiss had been with Lamb for three years. She also told about a woman's dog named Lightning.
“He always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called his relatives on Monday and told them he was not going to prison.
When the police reached Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, escaped the foot, ran into the forest and saved himself.
According to the University’s website, Lamb received a PhD in Education at the Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
The Hymned Stars
The last years have been heavy for the actor (in the picture left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that has happened has actually claimed taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw left for months due to two crashes
Luke Shaw's right foot broke in Manchester United's Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defendant will have to stay on the side for at least a half year, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field in this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in PSV's defence district in a bad trap in Héctor Moreno when the game was running for fifteen minutes.
Shaw received first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
“Shaw has two breaks in his leg and he’s hospitalized,” Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or over tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
The young man who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has experienced harsh and is now injured after amazing games.
In the shoe, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man cried.
I’m not a doctor, but when the foot breaks from two points, he’s on the side for half a month and doesn’t play in the block stage anymore.
I hope he will be able to play this season.
Moreno was unlikely when he did not follow the red card of the punishment.
The match judge Nicola Rizzoli has not punished the Mexican player.
Van Gaal said the Italian judge made a mistake.
“You might make a conclusion, but I think the situation was worth a punishment and a red card.
It was a two-foot hole.”
Shaw commented: "Thank you all for your messages.I can't say in words to describe how shy I am. My recovery begins here and I'm back stronger."
Manchester United's Luke Shaw in PSV
England's defense team has a special reason to recover to the European Championships in France in June.
“It’s a very bad injury,” PSV’s coach said.
“In such injuries, all parties are always very sorry.
The goal of the players is never to hurt the opponent.”
Moreno then broke down when he played against the Netherlands on the Mexican side of Van Gaal only in the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very sorry because he did not intend to hurt the opponent. It's unfortunate to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
“I didn’t see the situation.
I only saw the ball going in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn’t see Luke’s hole.”
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno told SBS6.
“I’m really sorry, I’m really sorry.”
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Every parent will notice before a long time that the child learns his favourite book almost outside.
Just to see David Cameron.
When the children's holiday organization asked Cameron to designate the children's books as their favorite, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, the Environmental Story of Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
In a text posted on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I'm glad to read it to my children because there's always some picture or message that we haven't noticed before."
It sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is intended to describe the book's line is a 2012 film version summary, which added new characters and details to supplement the short original text.
"In a city where the real trees and plants have been lost and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted lives who wants to get into the heart of his dreams girl Audrey by realizing this greatest dream: see the real tree," the text says.
Unless this is still suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partially aligned with the Lorax film line-up on the Internet Movie Database. It starts as follows: "In a city where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, a boy named Ted lives, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it feels unlikely that the book will be so strange to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys trees and prepares them for the needs of the title character despite the opposition of Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, wise creature that protects the forest.
Probably such a, meaningless pr task is believed to be an assistant task, apparently for a person who has not read Lorax as a child 20 times in the tube.
The Prime Minister’s representative said the text was probably from the Cameron District office.
SuperCamps did not comment more specifically on the matter but confirmed that the text was a handful of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of being out of the English team, but it’s still hard.
Pakistan's defeat in the United Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when we see the team chosen for the tour of England's last 3-0 Test series defeat is not expected to repeat.
I would not exclude the victorious chance.
The side of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but the shooting team has good players and the team’s attitude is strong – they don’t have bad experiences from 2012, only young positive.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a turner, and Adil Rashid, although he has no experience at the Test level, represents an attack option.
Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is obviously hard for me to understand as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks against challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are criticized according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a doubtful choice because – as I have said before – players are the best voters.
A few 50-point matches would have been held in Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets a new chance when he hits Yorkshire for more races.
England's chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, shakes his attitude even when he didn't work as well as he could, which doesn't surprise me.
The question of how long the test shooter gets the opportunity to make its effect is difficult.
Lyth won seven land matches, like his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton won nine.
Only Compton got the opportunity in both home and guest matches.
The only subject of the complaint may be that the British used Jonathan Trotsky first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in top condition – but this passed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes to the team and he is a striker that I appreciate high.
He is an unknown cricket player that we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must give at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this of course depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moe will start a strike with Cook, which will bring an extra turnover to the game while holding four speeds, and I’m not against the idea.
I don’t see any obstacle to the top player could be hit here, and this left player has already shown to be a great cricket player.
Moe may not have achieved much in his local team at Worcestershir, but he has been a team's three-player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as the first replacement player before starting in 2001.
He made three hundred points and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is in the team as a reservoir, and based on what I have seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – an average of 31 points as a striker and 35 inmates – and this may be a search engine, but a lot of inmates have not shown to be ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He learned a lot during this match.
Out of the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for its coaches.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan striker, Mahela Jayawardenen, as the Advisor for Test matches can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most harsh men of the species, bringing with him a lot of experience, because he has played in all kinds of circumstances and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the white ball of the game and brings both energy and mercy.
I think he has always influenced an appropriate international cricket, whether his role is a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has an intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even if it would say the same as before, can be an exciting spray.
Colly's team manager in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested one day in the matches, Root got a similar chance against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Though not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not set a match schedule.
And it must be remembered that, like players, their workplace also depends on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is bad in 2017
David Cameron's half-way renewed negotiation strategy on Britain's stay in the EU is on a daily basis deeper and deeper, even without the pleasant Jeremy's "yes or no" choice of Corbyn's to lead the Labour Party or the TUC striking Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is falling – although not all are their own actions. Some Member States are tired of Britain’s self-righteous agenda, which includes disagreementary concessions and harmful Treaty changes that they actually don’t even want.
At the TUC’s annual congress in Brighton, it was decided that gambling will not enjoy in the EU if it breaks down social security.
We could call it even a selfie agenda for Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Federal Chancellor go on top meetings and bilateral negotiations in different country’s capitals, click on a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-value persons, return home and report their acquisition of allies for reforms.
Everything is related to me.
“Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-sight ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we don’t care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s reasonable chancellor is a ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the position before it is corrupt, as it happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's Francois Hollande is facing a re-election or a successor election in 2017.
His power is also falling.
Poland will soon have a nationalist right-wing government, and Spain will have a left-wing government.
It’s hard to imagine to get them off to help selfie brides who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom. They don’t even want it because most of them have separatist dreams.
Some of these ministers may plan to deliberately throw useless comments on the style of the Scottish National Party in the 2017 UK Democratic campaign to push the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The new negotiations were a matter of arrangement.” – “The UK did not have anything to do with the new negotiations.”
Europeans know how the British newspaper is catching and how the EU’s skeptical oligarchy is, just like Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which resulted in a 2:1 vote for EU membership in 1973.
Someone may remind you of Boris Johnson, a widespread euro-opportunist who became known as "EU's direct banana letter exchangers" in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband at least knew his enemy.
These include tax rotators, phone hackers, and show-time signs that own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought almost the same about them, but then realized that when you’re in a hole with a harsh gorilla, you need to stretch the bananas into a spider so that the gorilla doesn’t eat you both for lunch and for dinner.
Miliband was more blair than Blair in opposition to the referendum. Blair was granted to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected. When France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the 2005 referendum, Blair was easily out of the fool.
The press never forgived him.
But a nice Jeremy Corbyn who gently killed me back on Westminster on Monday. I told him he no longer has time to waste on me. It may be a danger that he will put in place Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the 80s. It was a mistake and it's still.
Time may take, but Corbyn has to develop a coherent strategy for conversations with the media. Not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, whose BBC sofa he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what we kindly call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside of Ukip and Tory may probably answer this positively.
That’s what Hilary “Benn but not Benit” Benn said on radio and television this week, when his internal party officer tried not to admit that it was a bad bet from Corbyn to nominate the chief executive John McDonnell as the Secretary of State of Finance.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father had difficulties to be unfaithful on television to his Labour party colleagues without going too far and without losing his place in the basement.
The difficulties of Hillary were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to stay in the EU "in all circumstances."McDonnel didn't say so nor to his colleagues and members of the cabinet in a private case on Monday evening.
The desire for Corbyn to communicate whatever a wonderful picture is to remember that he even touched me. The messenger is important in the 24/7 season, especially in the social media discipline, where paranoia and fraud can be tolerated.
Cameron doesn’t have to give a free passport to the EU, with which he could consider Labour’s support as self-clear in the referendum, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins is at least that.
McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s equivocation of EU membership coincides with the Beninite island economy and the anti-capitalism past. The discussions no longer belong to the narrow circle of left-wing interdependents, for whom the idea that similarity combines is a key curriculum in the doctrinal chains.
Tom Watson is disappointed in the fact that Corbyn does not campaign for the departure. Foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter to their homeland.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital?They have suspicious voters.Why should they give concessions to the UK when everything can be useless?
The U.S. has already been quite disappointed by the Britain's cruel military demonstration in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the early Tory government cuts. I received a reminder of it on Monday in connection with the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize British authority's statements on electric cigarettes
According to the researchers, the state-funded institution’s claims that smoking of electric cigarettes is 95 percent less harmful than traditional smoking, arose at a meeting of 12 participants with connections to the tobacco industry.
The experts criticized the evidence presented in the report on electric cigarettes by the Public Health England (PHE) public health authority in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal.
The PHE described the publication of its report last month as "translational and comprehensive review of the results."
However, several researchers have questioned the security of the data and highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
The Lancet Medical Journal’s main paper last month took to the teeth a “significant happy foundation” on which the PHE’s main conclusion is based.
Additionally, two researchers have been questioning at BMJ whether the claims are based on "the rock or the sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have concluded: “The basic assumption of public healthcare is that the principles of action are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness.”
According to McKee and Capewell, a large audience assumes that PHE’s claim that “the best estimates at present are about 95 percent less harmful than traditional cigarettes” should be based on detailed analysis and modeling of the research results.
The claim came from one of the 12 people's meetings, which were called together to develop a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The model wanted to unify participants' views on the harmfulness of nicotine products. Meetings results were gathered into the study.
McKee and Capewell said the summit was supported by EuroSwiss Health, whose previous independent research was funded by British American Tobacco (BAT) according to sources.
In addition, the Executive Director showed in the Sustainable Action Report that he supports BAT’s work in accordance with public health.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting granted funding from the electricity support manufacturer. The previous funding claimed from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, however, the participant did not grant.
However, there are several well-known supporters of electric cigarettes, some of whom grant their participation as industry funders.
However, some of the participants are not familiar with their expertise in the field of smoking.
The meeting was also attended by the smoking committee.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group’s research report shows that there is no controversial evidence of the harmfulness of products to a wide range of products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, the links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, no evidence has been presented that electric cigarettes may promote smoking for children or non-smokers.McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to PHE’s head for health and well-being, Professor Kevin Fenton, the claims have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every two people who smoke through life die from a tobacco addiction.
All evidence indicates that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than the risks of traditional tobacco.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where the relative dangers compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
There are almost 80,000 smoking-related deaths per year in the UK, and smoking causes public health care costs £2 billion per year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current proof that electric cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the disadvantages they cause are a break-off of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should leave EastEnders, says Channel 4 spokesman
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. Johnson says commercial competitors would give their right hand to hit series, such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the license fee should only be used for the performance of programs that other TV stations do not.
He criticized the BBC’s likely fewer-to-people programmes simultaneously with the competitors’ large-scale programmes, as well as on the BBC4 channel, for example.
When BBC CEO Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to further cooperate with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried for six years to get Channel 4 to cooperate with BBC, without a result.
"I don't agree with the idea that the BBC will buy formats and broadcast programs that would clearly belong to any competing channel's software," Johnson told the parliament's upper room's communication committee, which was investigating the BBC's future.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which, in my opinion, is not necessarily a good idea in the medium or long-term, it should reduce its supply at least to programs that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC is sending The Voice to the best time to watch because it wants the most extensive support in the future.
If no other channel is concerned about the program, it is clearly ridiculous stupidity.
“I don’t understand why regressive taxes should finance programs that could be funded without subsidies,” Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, although it is its own production.
Many channels would give their right hand about it.
I don't understand how this serves the broadcasting company's service offer.
I don’t think that would be a loss for the BBC.”
Johnson is a screenwriter who was headed by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. he believes that the BBC has good viewers because the company has ambitious people working and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to the former Sky shooter Tony Ball, who in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 proposed that the BBC would sell out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC’s niche public programs are displayed on the BBC4 channel, where the number of viewers is not most often measured, but the programs fulfill their purpose. ”BBC can say, in defending its poor missions, that it has paid 4 billion pounds for broadcasting, it has done special programs that no one has seen.”
"BBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them."
Johnson said: "I challenge you to look for another system in the sense that is as old as that who will get the best benefit.
Everyone, of course, thinks that 150 pounds a year is cheap, but people for whom it is a big amount, especially if they don’t just watch the BBC.”
Former Sky and Channel 5 channels director David Elstein, who also stated his own opinions in the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should exchange the ancient mission to new "knowledge, teach and entertain".
According to Elstein, the BBC’s current supply is hardly available to educational programs – 1 percent on television and 0.1 percent on radio. he adds that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies and engage its mission in a new faith: “know, illuminate and entertain”.
On the issue of cooperation, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts from events such as the Proms Festival, whose concerts were broadcast only a break-part last year. ”The BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels so that the entire offer is also available online,” he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound balls using sonogenetics.
The video shows how the shoulder changes its direction when they are targeted by ultrasound.
Scientists have grown mates whose nervous system is genetically modified. Thus mates can be directed by ultrasound.
Small bulbs change their direction when they are targeted by an ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing area of the human ear.
The sound waves activate the movement nerves that are genetically modified in such a way that they contain a transmission tool that reacts to the ultrasound.
Scientists Monitoring the Activity of the Brain With Light
According to the researchers, mammals were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). In the method, ultrasound is used to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an irritation coming from outside the body.
The researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, Sreekanth Chalasani told the Guardian that the method can one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS).DBS treatment is an invasive method used in the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, where the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
Chalasani noticed that butterflies begin to react when placed in a fluid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles strengthen the ultrasound valves that extend into the mates.
Strengthened ultraviolet waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the mat cell membranes.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the shells with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically converted the shells so that some of their movement-controlling nerves appeared in the TRP4 ion channel.
When the ultrasound was directed to the converted mushrooms, the microwaves strengthened the sound waves and moved to the mushrooms, making a signal out in the nerve cell.
The method slightly resembles optogenetics, which is a mutant tool that allows researchers to activate the nerve cells through light.
According to Chalasan, however, sonogenetics has certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
Light is the subject of the study to the brain is directed by light by means of photovoltaics. Low-frequency ultrasounds instead pass through the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be directed into the brain through the cornea.
"We believe that with genetic and viral therapy, human nerve cells can be instantly exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and in cells that produce insulin.
Illegal torture – at your home door!
Advertisements are shameful for British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International’s anti-armament exhibition video.
The Killer Missiles!
The broken pedestrian!
The Firefighters!
Distances that cause unbearable pain but do not leave traces!
The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British government’s efforts to sell weapons to the pressure governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) exhibition that will be held at the ExCel exhibition center in Docklands, London.
More on the topic: DSEI stations: authority governments arrive in London
Bus stops and subway trains are also covered with notes that require a second blend.
“An important notification: are you moving by the subway from 15 to 18 September?” the notification reminds from outside the London subway notifications.
"In September, a group of weapons dealers will arrive in Dockland. customers are asked for help so that the stations can be terminated."
Three hundred statements have been made by artists whose works were presented at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A group called Special Patrol Group helped distribute advertisements around London with a six-pound “reklam hacking package” containing six-stop keys, which allegedly reached approximately one-third of the world’s bus stop advertisements.
Transport for London is not a public vandalism to laugh.
The Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and Essex University lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political works to the public outside the galleries.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art be brought into the real world. Many even move to work with protest movement activists.
Another of the anti-arm trade statements greeted the public transport users in the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed via Facebook more than 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and times have also done their work without compensation.
VCCP’s artistic director Matt Lever spoke about the absence of the exhibition and the empty spot in the ExCeL event calendar. He spoke: “Give them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They tried to get tired of a more realistic, obscure business video, but bright colors and animation will get the attention better.”
“They’ve done a great job and helped us to raise up the meetings where illegal torture trade is carried out,” says Amnesty’s Tom Davies.
"Now the government has to take action and ensure that torture tools are not illegally traded right at our home door."
Per the most creative antia of the stands, however, is presented in the exhibition rooms in ExCeL, where the exhibitors take advantage of magnificent circular statements of their stock.
In a press release, Saab announced an order made by the U.S. Army concerning "the transmissible AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "special-formed battle shot that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
It doesn’t sound very pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Students in Student Housing
I moved to a student residence law 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and I still believed in barets and moral relativism. Only now I remember the violent smile I irritated, and countless, long complaints of others.
The main lessons I can summarize into eight simple rules.
The move to the apartment is a lightweight and worst time shocking experience.
In the situation, it’s easy to wonder: you’re telling everyone where you’re, if you like the middle year and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don’t really hate or love Marmitea, because it’s just a slide, hahaha, I’m in my room.”
Sometimes take a breath.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask others.
Question guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like and the people you’t talk to even when your ribs were in the atmosphere and these people would share the switches.
Give space to others.
Your own rooms often serve as drinks, theaters and common living rooms, but your own room is also a place to dress, starting from underwear.
More about the topic: Don’t even imagine joining association and university studies
Introvert University is a hard place.
However, in many housing rooms, a social culture is formed, where you walk from room to room and form lifelong friendship relationships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place of return.
In this environment, it’s not possible to say: “I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to disappear so that I can recharge the energy I’ve spent with you.”
Try to see if someone of your student friends has drowned into a social connection. Maybe it would be worth not to knock at the door and instead send a text.
In the words of the word: knock.
In my student residence there was a guy who thought the unlocked door meant that he was welcomed in.
He saw everything.
Get friends with the bread.
You start your study properly when breaking is in, so if you breathe brownies and knock at someone's door, you're not going to look like a 50-reader, a slightly strange case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've cooked you something small, smile when I'm curious about your personalities."
Home-made flavours are a great way to get new friends.
Your student friend will be forced to talk to you. Thanks to the delicious surprise, they can remain a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires you reasonable bread cooking skills.
If you serve unfortunate cookers made of powder, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to fall asleep when you knock at the door.
Food humidification is also a common disadvantage in student housing conditions.
Of course, taking another chicken is a steal, but can his tea throw a cup of another’s milk?
Always check the owner.
You’ll probably get permission, even if the milk loans the jurppisiki tank owner.
I understand well that it’s annoying if someone smells you something. Still try to deal with the situation as adultly as possible – unlike my student friend who plundered his milk washing machine to punish the milk thieves.
The woman is now in prison.
Don’t worry when others try to sleep or fall asleep.
Not only because it’s decent, but it’s also worth remembering that each other covers a cave...
In my own apartment, a girl asked the inhabitant of the nearby room to adjust the music connection to a smaller, because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just added the voice.
When in the neighbor's room I finally silenced, the girl gave the neighbor to sleep for two hours. She went to the test for three hours, left the music to cool into her room and locked the door.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would change to the same home?
And would it not be strange if you first thought that your student friend would be your future spouse, you would start dating, you would divorce, you would have to see him every day, and you would lose the right of your common friends to meet him?
If your student is not the only right one, try to get rid of your desire.
If you notice at a moment that someone has forgotten his key to a room with no door closed, the boundary of pudding and temptation is harder than you could think.
A good pile is fun, but one that will recover in a moment.
Hiding some object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one should confuse the room with a toothpaste and a sample.
The door of the other room can lock and tap the keys into the water glass, which is placed in the freezer, but don't attach anybody's goods to the roof with a blueberry a few times more.
A racial attack on a residence of foreign students in Kite - a house planned as a reception center was destroyed in Salossa
A terrorist attack on the residence of foreign students took place on Saturday morning in Kite, North Karjala.
Unlike the police previously said, it is not the accommodation of minors asylum seekers but the bedroom of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical People's University of Kiteen.
The windows and walls of the university’s accommodations were scattered with racist signs, such as hackers, and a metal object was thrown through the one accommodation window, the police said in a statement.
According to Luukkaisen, who serves as a responsive teacher of the National University’s youth social security-training, the building, which was the subject of primacy, was estimated to be ten people at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere,” Luukkainen says.
The National University has accommodated people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Every one in the building has a statue.
Some are studying in adult primary school, some are in professional studies and some are studying in Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is the so-called permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police investigate the attack as a damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, the event was held for students on Monday an informational conference, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here, and no one has wanted to leave.
We have been with foreign students for twenty years, and this is the first time something like this happens,” Luukkainen says.
According to the police, the walls have already been cleaned.
According to the report, there were at least three men who had been on the road in a car.
I think this is the main end of the youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
There’s nothing more serious than that,” he says.
There is also a hospital in Salossa, where a reception center is designed.
The incident happened last week.
This was on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
The walls of the hospital were drawn with a hack and written "You are not welcome" in English.
A criminal report has been made to the police.
Updated 15.9.16.02 Corrected the erroneous information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state stops the Y train to the Bear - passengers in their arms, "very stupid"
The Y-boat that runs from Helsinki to Raasepor Karja will cease to run in March.
The news annoyed the passengers riding to the start of the train at the Helsinki main railway station.
Especially the downside strikes the blessed people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the town.
It’s very stupid because the population is growing and workers need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can not depend on anything but on political will – or its lack.
Bengtström says in HSTV’s interview video they’re coming even with a tractor to the capital.
There are also new train changes.
The H and R trains that pass on the edge are combined into a new R line.
The station of Purola in Lake and Nuppulinna in Tuusul is out of use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced on Tuesday the information on the routes the Ministry will buy train transport in the next contract period.
The contract period changes over the course of the year and there are routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be concluded in the autumn, will be approved by the monetary committee.
Bengtström believes that the state train driver is a short-looking activity.
Let us make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then the compassion comes.
The Y train is also used by non-Raseporians and the Blessed, because it is fast and passes through several positions.
The Spanish Annina Pöyryä damaged the fate of those traveling further to the city area by train.
"It's a bad thing for those who have to re-planning their journey," he said while hurting the Y train.
A little relief is allowed.
The river is likely to have a new railway connection, which will replace the Y railway in the Helsinki Seudun Transportation (HSL) area, i.e. to the Church.
This brings additional costs to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities of the region and to their taxpayers.
“We are now going to explore the different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices,” said HSL’s CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is not possible to assess the cost accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train for about a million years, the ministry of course much more.
The R line leaves two positions.
On the other hand, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes are stopped throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer purchases train transport on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to the Pieksämäki-Vrakus route.
The trains are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million roads are carried out on covered roads per year, with a total of about nine million roads in transport purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring to the state an annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately 27.5 million euros per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Actuality: "Marx is worth knowing"
The global economic crises have raised up Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, Capital, published in the years 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, former Chairman of the SKP, in the book Marx's Capital Current.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his prejudice.
Marx’s estimates of the development, internationalization and infiltration of the capitalist economy in all areas of life, of the concentration of capital, and of the growing role of money and imaginary capital have turned out to be surprisingly distant.
The book, based on the Capital Seminars organized by Hakasen, is also written by Aalto University professor, valued economic participant Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is current “now and forever.”
Not that the ex-Chairman of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation is Marxist?
not anyway.
Korkman says in the phone that he does not consider Marx as an actual economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Nowadays, social sciences are distinctive and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary hours.
“The ordinary concept is that the story of the devil tells us about the false opinions of the dead men,” Korkman starts.
Marx’s predictions went very wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the initial stage of capitalism, Korkman thinks.
However, Korkman sees value in Marx’ radical attitude.
“The most important thing in Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Now we are discussing Marx’ interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may be able to give inspiration to those who want to understand the big picture of a world that is changing as a result of technological mutation,” Korkman says.
But what the government should decide tomorrow does not help Marx.
He believed that capitalism was an unexpected event that should only be stopped.
In the meantime, Marx should be acquainted.
“In the 1970s Marx could not read,” Korkman says.
“The Poles and the Trotsky and the other Dutch hated all capitalism, but even more one another.”
Today, the discussion is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political burden of the back years.
“Every social scientist should get acquainted with Marx’s thought world—as with other classics,” Korkman says.
United Nations calls for war criminals sentence in Sri Lanka
The United Nations calls on the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Civil War in Sri Lanka, the news agency AFP said.
The report of the United Nations on the civil war from 1983 to 2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka’s armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil militants of war crimes.
The Civil War in Sri Lanka estimates that at least 100,000 people were killed.
There is no accurate information about the number of victims.
Especially the massive attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be thoroughly investigated, the United Nations report requires.
The report accuses Sri Lanka’s armed forces of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been accused of forcing side and children to be fighters.
According to the report, both sides have committed the murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to organize the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN court because of foreign judges.
In the yo-test in England, social media was pointed.
In the autumn student writings on Wednesday was a long foreign language, which was mostly English.
His English skills were tested by more than 16,000 experiments.
In the experiment, he could write about the subject on social media.
Based on our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the writing of the 150-250 words in English could indicate the webmaster's consulting tape to the holder.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Leeli's resting chair.
He was asked for advice on how parents should look at things as well as the youth.
There were four subjects, one of which was to be chosen.
“It was the hardest of them,” said Mia Lybeck, the English doctor at the Swedish High School in Porvoo.
The third issue was just a quote by former European Commission President José Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was very good, according to Lybeck.
It had to write a fireproof, why should hire young people to work.
“Always in our school we’ve been trained to write speeches,” Lybeck says and evaluates the whole test as “might normal.”
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts, such as the adaptation of the summer camp to climate change and the processing of large masses of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn scripts will continue on Friday, when there is a second domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish test.
At school, the exam is organized normally, i.e. the wage-wage demonstration does not affect it.
The Student Examination Board calls on the examiners to look for appropriate road connections in time so that they can get ready for the examination.
Additional time can also be obtained if it is possible to prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A trade with weapons is threatened
On Wednesday morning, a shop was stolen in the town of Oulu.
According to the police, the thief was dressed in dark clothes and covered his face with a command tape.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a hand weapon and received a small amount of money.
The case is investigated as a violent robbery.
Police are preparing tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki - support parties from other parts of Finland
A demonstration against the government’s cuts will be blocked by the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary data, there can be tens of thousands of people.
Members of the associations of SAK, Akava and STTK will meet at Rautatientor at 11:00 p.m.
Police are also expected to participate in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work, in turn, is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to safeguard the flow of the giant alarm.
The roads that lead to the railway station will be closed from motor vehicles for the period between 9:30 and 14:30.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
From the direction of Hakaniem, the traffic will be interrupted from the direction of Kaisaniem, from the direction of the west, from the Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people in the Helsinki police station, Deputy Commissioner Seppo Kujala?
At least so far it seems enough.
I am not concerned with police struggles.
According to Kujala, there will be support parties from other parts of Finland due to the demonstration.
The exact numbers are not told by the police.
“A lot is coming, but we’re going to do it by our own,” Kujala says.
The police urged to avoid private vehicles in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic gap will extend from the Hakaniem level to the nuclear center.
Traffic stops are expected from the morning to the morning.
With the protesters coming from other countries, there are also a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed to travel to the Railway Station.
Basically, the buses are far away.
We have to go to the place of the demonstration,” Kujala says.
It will also stop Helsinki’s public transportation.
This is a positive side from the policy point of view.
The problem of the smoothness of the public transport, which is normally in the hands of these large crowd meetings, is now being addressed in part by itself.
The protest organizers have told the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents to the government’s economic policy in Helsinki.
Police are waiting for the demonstration to go quietly.
There are ordinary workers or unemployed – ordinary citizens.
The Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held throughout Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The great demonstration held by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For this, for example, there is no very good reference from the Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at Jyväskylä University, emeritus Martti Siisetinen.
It is no wonder that the Ay movement protests.
If it did not do so, it would raise the hands up in front of the government, Sisišinen says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporateism - and also those points that have been important for the development of the Finnish well-being state.
The government’s struggles lack the right to contract.
Here are a lot of features that the ay movement is actually trying to get on your knee.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have any support from all the winners for Friday protests.
The new is the sharp division that the demonstration will make among those that the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland demonstrated their mind at the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If the Friday demonstration is looking for a reference point, it could be the unemployed giant demonstration, the Murrostorstai, which was held in 1993, said.
In the middle of the deepest slam, the Murrostorstai gathered around 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (central) government compurates from the labour market crisis to the other.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the salary organizations have never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the times of Murrostorsta.
In addition to this, there is now a very bourgeois government in the power of Finland ever, Siisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing despite the philosophical speeches.
Even at the time of the lightning there were certain elements of the old workers’ movement.
Thousands of protesters are expected to arrive on Friday.
It will also stop public transport and eventually close dayhouses and schools.
Unless the demonstration receives unshared support from the wage recipients, it can become the highest over the years.
Over the past few years there have been approximately 300 demonstrations annually in Helsinki.
They are fairly placed.
Traditionally, the Ay movement’s demonstrations in Finland have been quite peaceful – although the practices have strengthened in recent years.
Traditionally, protests in Finland avoid conflicts, be lawful.
The protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying the property, Siisinen says.
The late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest has changed.
The EU membership inspired farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get a pig on them.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also strikes among other pilots and aircraft managers.
Do you remember the strikes and protests?
The 1970s metal and electricity
The major strikes of the 1970s were the metal break in 1971 and the power and electric break in 1977.
70,000 metalmen were involved in the metalmen strike.
The strike was suspended on the proposal of the Council of Reconciliation after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The employees received a 16-percent wage increase.
In the spring of 1977, the electricity break lasted 49 days and caused electrical interruptions throughout the country.
The murder in 1993
On 4 November 1993, approximately 20,000 people, many of whom became unemployed, gathered for the House of Representatives to demonstrate their opinion for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters strike was one of the longest, unless the longest national strike in the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police suffered the egg flood in a protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
“Cyprus teaches, the EU stops,” one of the shocks was said.
In Spain, the farmers suffered a tonne of snow.
Also, the Helsinki EU summit in 1999 led farmers to protest and burn July balls in front of the meeting site.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were striking for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been in the strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by several deaths that occurred during the strike.
The factory was threatened by the strike and the mass shooting of the nurse in 2007.
The threat of mass expulsion eventually accelerated negotiations to the outcome.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Doctors in the strike - forced," was the striking slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of local health centers and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to a vibrant debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased the salaries of doctors.
Students Moving in 2013
About 5,000 students marched for study support in Helsinki from the Senate to the House of Representatives in 2013.
Central Criminal Police Finds the Backgrounds of a Finnish Refugee Filled to the Austrian Police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out the background of the refugee strike registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police arrested a hole in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is unclear whether it was possible to travel to Finland.
Everyone who was in the cold was in good condition.
We had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the place of the event in Austria, Central Criminal Police Supreme Commissioner Tero Haapala said.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in a truck in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers were killed in the attack.
According to General Radio, which first told about cooperation with the Austrian police, the track belongs to the Finnish shareholding company.
The company operates, among other things, restaurant activities and its chief executive is a foreigner, a 40-year-old man.
Two people have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
The Captain of Refugees, An Ex-Drug Cursor, and A Wicked Businessman: The Story of Five Traffickers
A wicked king of scammers, a violent shipwreck, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who considers himself a good residual.
For example, such people practice human trafficking into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, working at the University of Trento, have met and interviewed dozens of scammers and their “customers,” and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tracks of human trafficking, present solutions and present the traffickers from the different stages of the business.
HS will present five of them.
Remove them immediately.
Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians go there for a summer holiday.
For its location, the islands are also suitable for trafficking, as the way to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain burning captain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna islands are famous for their landscapes, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
It has been done by Emir with its blue, ten-metre cotton fence hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it will have a capacity of 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about €8,000 after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for him clients around Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab season, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape from the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed until the refugee crisis broke again.
Guests arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as they see good.
The food is given in such a way that the customers just and just survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer gets the money out, it's their problem.
We go to the water at midnight with the shutdown.
The first night is taken out of the island, then stopped, waiting for the day, and the next night drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in the 20 meters high waves passengers cry and vomit.
In the end, the human body has been destroyed in half an hour and Emir is on a return trip.
Emir wants him to be afraid.
That’s why he blows his clients and at least claims he’s hunting the hunters to die.
She tells in the book that when the police once caught him, he threw all his passengers over the board and ordered them to swim on the nearest island.
"I met the customers individually from the neck and threw them over the plate," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He said that he should be abused by this.
I am going to get them away immediately.
They need to show them immediately who is determining here.
A regular taxi driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovað, Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - the start engine is pulling to the last, and otherwise it has seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
Near the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are allowed.
In the forests surrounding the center, men who travel without their family are staying in tents, shelves and abandoned cars, what now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for a reason or for a reason, have not filed an asylum application to Serbia.
Some are also accommodated in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often run off - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in difficult landscapes, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
Finally arriving in the region of Bogova, the point of the massive human trafficking, people are deadly.
The Goran Cytes are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are the Syrians, he says in the book.
“They’re saying their thing once and it’s enough,” Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to get rid of it.
Goran doesn’t like it.
The foolish foolish all the way.
First, the price is agreed, for example, 300 euros, then they drop it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes to be a nice and good-hearted man.
I am not interested in money.
I’m doing my job and I’m helping people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he’s going to do jobs cheaper than others, and he’s going to pay only 50 euros per person on the Hungarian border.
The road is three hundred kilometers, most comfortably by motorway.
They claim a three- or four-fold price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It’s not a big amount for the smugglers, but in Serbia it’s quite a nice return.
Serbia has ordered no taxis to carry migrants 12 kilometers closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care about it: he knows the roads and roads and takes his silk a kilometer away from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and throw away.
In the work of grace
A 35-year-old Kongo man is called the Missionary Priest, and it is not just a surname.
He actually has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Campala, where many believers flee from the Congo, as well as a small center where children refugees are assisted.
In addition to the prophecy, the Missionary priest runs on a trafficking bus, where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He is doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
She brushes her shoes several times a day and takes care that the rubber of white calcars is stylishly thrown under the low belt of the garbage.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his land car and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary Priest does not preach, he arranges people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five telephone numbers of the Missionary Priest.
He advises that it is worth arriving on the border in the morning, hiding the money in a whistle and putting it in the midst of the traders who cross the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or a refugee to the Uganda authorities, it is necessary to inform the authorities that they have come from, for example, the northern Kiev war zones and that they have been forced to escape from their homes by violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Messaging Prophet will arrange a new identity for the customer.
An old identity card is removed and another is replaced.
It helps the Missionary's contacts with the police in Uganda.
After that, the client will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, and finally to the UNHCR.
The missionary preacher knows the bureaucracy because he has also become a refugee in Uganda.
He calculates each stage separately: the application to the police of Uganda costs about a hundred euros, the handling of documents to a humanitarian organization about 150 euros, and the migration process, for example, to one European country, 4 500-7 000 euros.
Folio and Ice Fires
Tom is a beginner narcissist, a former narcissist.
A 40-year-old Irish man travels on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people to the trails on his way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, as well as dozens of runners who may not even know that they are a human transport business.
On the night, Tom and the taxi driver raised their client, usually 2-3 people, from some of the Calais's center.
They drive the A26 motorway and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would have to organize illegal immigration directly into prison.
That's not what Tom wants, he has been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs with his clients over the motorway to a relaxation place where the chefs fall asleep before going through the channel to the British.
Tom chooses the right thread - it is to make sure that it is on the way right to England and not even to the Netherlands - and cuts around the protective gate of the security wire.
It should be done quietly so that the bosses don’t wake up.
Sometimes the driver is in the line, but then the desire is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom scratches his client into an aluminum foil, similar to the one that in the kitchen is scratched around a paste or oven.
It should prevent the police’s heat scanner from seeing the hidden.
Some use ice-filled bedbugs for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client on the trail and leaves the place hoping that the chief of staff will not rush the shipping passengers at least before Britain.
The King of Traffickers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world’s most famous human traffickers.
The Upporik Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal Mediterranean landings, ruling the maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been working since the 1990s and has constantly developed new methods of counterfeiting.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he requires the money only at the end.
One of the new methods is the luxury scam: Turkish ports are rented according to the entertainment fee to take U.S. or European families for a comfortable few-day tour tour.
In reality, the vessels are charged to accurately from Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghanistan, who are transported for a fee of €5,000 to €7,000 first from Istanbul to some port and from there by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until they have time to leave.
People are shut down in minibus and drive somewhere to the coast.
They are ordered to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, it is necessary to rise to the ship quickly.
Passengers must keep the whole journey hidden under the carriage.
The maritime guard can only monitor the depth of the ship swimming, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately €53,000 for one luxury ship trip after expenses.
He does not take care of the practical things himself but he employs captains, painters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to take care of the work for himself.
During the summer season, transportation will be organized at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is believed to have bought the land through cover companies, a pharmacy company and more than a hundred apartments he rented.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 simultaneously with a Turkish Democratic Party member and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that he apparently disappeared.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Agency book will appear this week, not next week.
The American Olympic Race member tells him about his illness and becoming a prostitute.
Three times competing at the Olympics, Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells us about ending her career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published a breakdown of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the competition in the top condition and ran in the carnival for the second best time.
In the final, he was in panic.
He ran to the top at the very beginning and defended his lead position with a land race.
150 meters before the painting, however, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the rail, and the other competitors crossed him one after the other.
I felt an idiot and thought I would never run again.
But I forced myself beyond the painting line, says Favour Hamilton in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bilateral mood disorder.
His brother Dan had done a year before Sydney matches suicide, and he himself felt huge success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she began prostitution in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strangers.
He also urged his husband to accept his actions.
Favour Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favour Hamilton’s explanations about becoming a prostitute was that he sought the same adrenaline patterns as he had received when competing in public sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he had a bilateral mood disorder.
The double life of the former star rider was revealed at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters world statistical peak at 3.57.40, but remained the last in the Olympic Finals in Sydney.
The world champion rejoiced when the alliance put the Norwegian skyscraper in the shore: "Right"
Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of suitability, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian ski association have dismissed the sports agreement as last summer and autumn.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not even won a multi-world champion and an Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the next season's World Cup.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was pleased that the alliance put the skyscraper in the shore.
“Thank you for showing your backbone,” Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We can't allow one active athlete to avoid working for the federation's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Alliance and Northug is a matter of money.
Northug would obviously want to be part of the season in the country team so that he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was pleased to represent the alliance, which also takes care of the future generations, and does not give one athlete on the solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I have been a part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own statement on Tuesday, in which he assured that he wants to play in the Norwegian colors in the next season in the World Cup as well as afterwards in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals, two of which were gold.
He participated in the team that won the messaging ball last winter in Falun Gong.
Translator Day is also celebrated in the North.
On the day 25th of September, bookings will be held in different restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Book of the Translators.
The aim of the day is to emphasize the high level of Finnish food expertise and to lower the threshold of departure to the restaurant, as well as to raise awareness of the importance of the shell as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are focused on the capital area, but top restaurants reviewed and classified by an unpartial operator are found throughout Finland.
The international attention obtained by the event is a demonstration of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of competing restaurants and the organization.
On the northern part of the day will be held in Vaasa a restaurant in Fondiks and Kantarelliks.
On the day of the competition there is a restaurant in the Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to become one of the most important international events of the organization, which will be held during the same day in different worlds.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki newspaper: the establishment of the Kauhava reception center was encouraged by the Chancellor of Justice
The Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception center for the Kauhava ex-armament premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still permanently a critical infrastructure in the crisis, which is in use by the defence forces and its partner, namely the Finnish Separate Networks Oy.
The Kauhajoki newspaper reports that, according to the individual, the placement of the reception center in the same building complex would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area of the former Airport School and its airport, the impact of which has not yet been cleared when preparing the reception center, the newspaper writes.
The report notes that over the past two years there have been negotiations on the organization of air training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator to the airport.
This has been discussed, among others, with the Minister of Defense Jussi Niinistön (ps.) and the Minister of Defense Arto Rädy.
The private person points out to the court chancellor that the complaint is not a matter of the primary objection of the reception center, but that the planned place in the former guard area is incorrect.
The local government discussed the reception center issue last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Governance means that the immigrants and those who are here have the necessary circumstances, Niinistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties in their office in Mäntyniem.
The President said the concerns about the refugee situation united all the participants.
He appreciates that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to confidentially discuss ultimate issues.
Especially when we are facing a lot of challenges.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States on the territory may have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and consequently in the Baltic Sea region.
It is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, that is, the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further tensions on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The issue of NATO was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market.

Only alarm vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
Metro and roadside protests on Friday
Metro and train drivers will take part in the demonstration on Friday from the morning ship to the night ship.
The Railway and Metro staff association told the STT this evening.

All-night living rooms and groups of children with disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for developing disabled and autistic school students are organized normally.
Early education agency promises to report further changes to the activity tomorrow.
Press Release: Risk is high
According to Sipila, communication requires a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio interviews are one channel among others.
This channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sibiu told reporters in the parliament.
She has not yet wanted to evaluate how often the repeated way of the Prime Minister's television and radio conversations will come.
According to Sipil, talks may not always be transmitted in the future via the Ylu channel.
If other channels are registered as a channel, then let’s look at it.
Now we are using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilé, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires the holding of a television and radio meeting for citizens.
This complexity, of which we are talking now, is quite complex and requires a longer reasoning.
That’s why we ended up on this channel.
The talk will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 both on TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also see it in the area.
The Syndrome takes a great risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipila's television broadcast does not tell about the more general conversion of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the definition of the public debate more strictly into their own hands and to refuse the public debate to question questions? asks Professor Anu Koivunen at the University of Stockholm.
It comes to mind the recent comment of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not connected.
We understand that the commercial media has been angry with the announcement of Sipila.
It would be strange if the media field did not react.
The methods of communication of political decision makers are not a matter of declaration in democracy.
The task of the media representatives is to do a definite effort to ensure that the agenda of politicians is not taken as given.
He says television is a big risk.
In his speech, he should bring something new and special to the table, so that the exceptional high expectations set to the speech are met.
Is there anything else that we have heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old in permission, you have to wonder why such a great action was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Generally, take this risk in the sense that it is not a specific situation, but a routine gap among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be characterized as a message from politicians or the parliament and the government, which is not in line with the interests of the Yale or the general line.
The Oval Veto
In the upcoming speech of Sipila, it is also important what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher emphasizes.
The evening will be to look carefully where Sipilä lacks and where not, says the research coordinator of Jyväskylä University Heikki Kuutti.
According to Kuut, the television speech is from Siberia an oval veto, because thus this man can bring his own view to the expression without sounding.
This makes the message a large audience without a journalist filter, unlike a news event where journalists can ask critical questions.
She goes through the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong of the speech because accurate questions cannot be asked.
I think it’s very important how the silk appears on the TV – the currency sweets, the hands wipes.
He compares Sibila to a father-in-law who now tells the people what to do.
If it works well, it can work well.
The situation is different than when the government is informed of something, because in this person it is like speaking directly to another person.
This (US President Barack Obama) Obama and his partners practice regularly.
Very exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens as truly exceptional.
He says that this has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
The exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the prime minister wants to make the Finnish people compassionate for the strikes that are facing.
On Friday, workers organised protests and strikes against the government’s actions.
Left union chairman Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, where the speech would also be discussed.
SDP’s chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) once again announces that he will challenge Sipila’s dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
A half year after the election.
Unfinished cannot be hidden, Rinne writes on Twitter.

Finnish UFC star disappointed by youth violence: You can cause hatred
The Kurdish volunteer, Makwan Amirkhani, posted a video on Facebook in which he focuses on migrants.
Makwan Amirkhani held a strong speech against the street games of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arrived in Finland at the age of five with his family, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking him to look at one of his Instagram accounts.
The account has been uploaded to videos in which young people are struggling with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he’s disappointed with the young people’s evil.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The remains throw the ground plates, sitting on the other and striking invisibly without thinking about any of these consequences, what this causes when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
Difficult to defend
Some of the young people seen in the video are immigrants.
The Helsinki police commissioner, Jarmo Heinosen, said the battle videos have been uploaded to the social media by immigrants and young people from the country.
Especially the fact that you are fighting on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants harder here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani reminds that in Finland there are sites that search for the crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite a lot.
It’s a bit hard, guys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are in a stranger country still and you will be guests here for a long time.
This is a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they sometimes become the subject of someone’s racism, then you may blame yourself for it.
Think a couple of times before you go, you’ll go.
Amirkhani says that violence is a contribution to racism.
You’ll get a hate that I don’t like.
You have things somewhat bad, and that way you will not cure them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK holds its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK’s chairman Lauri Lyly tweeted that the salary organization is considering on Monday its standing on its alternative savings by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
The staff center organization STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it will submit to the government its own proposal to the 5% productivity rate demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central).
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest wage-wage organization SAK soften its position.
The Chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, commented on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK’s work committee will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market portfolio" and that obligatory laws are needed by agreements made by active parties.
Lyly reminds that the proposal of the Prime Minister Sipila's government for a social agreement was not suitable for the SAK.
Sipilä would previously discontinue negotiations on the social agreement after the SAK did not agree to commit to the goal of the 5% productivity.
Comments Off on “Thanks to get rid of a little bit of fun”
It would be a bit ridiculous to have a nick if there is already a reconciliation paper in your pocket, says Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels vary in the salary of the winners from layer to layer.
Do you want to call the government down or do you agree with it?
On Monday, the Allied leaders of the SAK expressed holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole country was threatened.
It spread to the akavalis.
The teachers’ professional organization OAJ threatened the closure of schools and dayhouses.
On Tuesday OAJ canceled: no school or dayhouses are completely closed.
On Wednesday, the chairman of the staff center organization STTK Antti Palola (sd) presented in a peaceful manner.
He said he was in contact with the government and prepared an alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central) for a 5% productivity rate.
Akava’s chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), has urgently announced that his agreement is already ready.
At the beginning, the office of the SAK was not included.
Chairman Lauri Lylyn (SD) is difficult to reach agreements when the federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, Lyly announced that the SAK’s work committee will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to “open the labour market portfolio”.
In order to create a joint proposal for the employers, the SAK should tend to adopt a five-percent productivity target.
It is no wonder that the STTK has a good relationship with the Government of Siberia.
The right hand of Palola, the director responsible for the social influence of the STTK, Jukka Ihanus, previously served as the special assistant of the Central Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniem.
Palola characterized that the government’s ay skills are constantly improving.
A coincidence or not, but the outcome of Palola took a bit of cleansing away from the Finnish standers, whose painting is made by the AKT’s Marko Piirainen (sd).
It would be a bit ridiculous to wear a nick if there is already a consensus paper in your pocket.

Russia calls Finland a bad host: "This should not be repeated"
The President of the Russian Duuma Sergei Naryshkin has criticized the Helsinki Etyj summit.
The President of the Russian Duuma, Sergei Naryshkin, said that Mongolia is a better ETIAS host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator, a prosecutor's session of the Parliamentary General Assembly of the ETIE has begun, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Celebration Meeting.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were subjected to the European Union's sanctions list, to attend the meeting - a matter that the president said to remind journalists of.
We believe that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This should not be repeated, Naryshkin stressed by the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin’s criticism targeted Finland and the EU in addition to the United States, where his access was also banned.
Crimes are a political suicide for the EU, Naryshkin said.
The delegation of Russia arrived in Mongolia without trouble, so Naryshkin continued to torture Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the parliamentary general meeting will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have any obstacles.
Naryshkin has met at Ulan Bator meeting leader Ilkka Kanerva, who, according to the Russian media, has already talked with the Russian delegation.
The lock faces the real playoff: "Paints strictly"
Tappara and Luko will continue today in the Hakam Forest with cattle days, when both are in fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicted that today in Hakamets there will be no real paintings.
The attack took place yesterday in a 3-2-step square.
The rise was male, since last season the silver group was in the worst of two goals loss.
The class was more successful on Tuesday.
The capture of the spacecraft as a guest of Blues, which started the capture, was round zero points, and the losses were like 2-3.
The hard game, the paintings strictly, if no one plays the same game as last year, the Lock-attacker Janne Lahti predicts the settings of the team on the pages.
The murderer has become a fairly playoff puzzle for the rabbits.
In the past two years, it has been just the end of the season.
In both cases, a decisive seventh match is required for the solution.
In the last season, Lukko caught the series down in the fourth game, but Tappara rose up in the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except the paintings.
Both of those who were rejected yesterday will get a peak today.
With the painting of the murderer, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the Lukko-tollps, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Previous Post:Awesome Scene in the Mountains
The sports manager Toivola handled the main coach uncompatible subsequent part to the Rautakalli, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It is a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone directed a Rocky film, in which he himself played the main role.
The supporters sensationally put into camps the heavy series to the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got great sympathy, although he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first evening, Mika Toivola wrote a rough silver story for Pori.
The unnamed and wooden patapack advanced as a surprise for everyone to the SM finals of 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but strong subjects like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Porin Mattia and Pele Peltosta.
In the shooting games, the players painted their heads red and cut the irokees.
Hope became a blonde.
The famous TV speaker JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
He took the winning silver.
She was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that this season’s novel works the same as ten years ago.
A man who works as an ex sports manager has built a patapaca for the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have hidden the remains in a distance as Rocky pigs in a massacre.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparisen’s gains are somewhere else than in the game.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the main character will be performed by Pekka Rautakallio.
Carry Stone has crucified the Rail Balloon to Sean Connery.
The Railroad is a rock film written by Toivola, one of the most famous actors that Connery would have been in the 1976 original work.
There is nothing else in the Railway Hall than the Rocky name.
The game philosophy of the railball does not include scratching and small music.
He appreciates a hard game, but there’s a different thing to play hard than a pig.
During the past season, Garret Stafford has gone back to the head of the Dead Jere.
He received 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Rail Bowl put the man in the shower.
He didn’t deserve a minute.
We only play those who deserve.
I don’t accept such a game and it doesn’t belong to the hassle, the hot Railway Hall rose after the game to the Hundred People.
This season’s team is strange.
There are trains, veterans, police and railers.
There are practically no key players in the best game age.
It is no wonder that the coach has complained about the skill.
How much have you been able to influence the player’s earnings, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season have influenced the procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was somewhat narrow, the Railway Board responded diplomatically.
Under the surface.
From the 1953 model, the Rautakallio is clearly interested in moving to the place of Toivola as a sports bomb.
Men’s contracts end in the spring.
The axis balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the number of losses with a goal difference 1-6.
Hopefully, it would not have been good to write a script.
Olga Temonen as Sipe Santapuk's Mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they’t have anything in common.
Olga Temonen will play for the first time in the direction of her husband.
Yes, I'm presenting my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way it feels crazy, actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulan’s former bassist and director Tuukka Temosen since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but now Olga is playing in Tuuka for the first time.
Olga's role in the movie "You're About Us Beautiful" that tells about the early years of Apulan, is the rumble Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
The circus cumbers and supports his son, even though this father, Risto (who is presented by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get acquainted with my real preview of the Circus, the easier it feels to play the role.
He’s a great guy and I’m grateful to Tuuk that he trusted the role for me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that the twin has approached a lot.
They met, talked by phone and communicated.
The circle has helped a lot.
We have gone through many different corners of their history.
The circle also happily understands that the drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little colored.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apula would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 90s, it was a great and a great time.
There was a relatively small chance that someone really succeeds, but the Circus had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot of Tuuka about this youth before the film plans.
The stories of my parents are a little different.
So, if you’re a 15-year-old teenager, then how many parents really know what you’ve swallowed.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola's badly named scitcher.
Olga was a daily and kind girl who’t have anything to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could have secretly admired.
Olgan says he has done so much cooperation with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a big joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now, the entire production group is going to Heinola for a month for descriptions.
However, the couple who live in Iit, for their little children, will often go home for a night, because the distance is not too long.
We will run for the whole month of Heinol.
They have taken us very warmly, just asked what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 is the most expensive film in Finland.
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film by Timo Vuorensola is €17 million.
It will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
Iron Sky: The Coming Race is the most expensive film ever in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film was Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The animation of Angry Birds will come up after the completion of Iron Sky 2, with the film’s budget of over €100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukoma, will begin in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and will last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will go to Belgium next week.
The budget is not afraid.
I was sick at Reno.
I have such a relaxed fiil of the script because I know exactly what kind of paper should be.
Everyone in the work group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It’s great to go to Belgium.
Although the time is strict, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I don't have to wait for this leaf to be shown to the public, he tells the Iltalehd.
Initially, the budget for the film was scheduled for 8-10 million, but with the development of the script, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but there is a big stock.
However, the film would have to get 100 million, because each image and effects are so expensive.
Now everything is turned so strictly that there is no loose.
The film producer Iron Sky Universe today launched a crowdfunding campaign and a crowdfunding loan, which will pay 4-8 percent annual interest.
The final interest rate will be determined according to demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will pay the loan back.
The acting films include Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Cool or cool?
Big Logos Returns to Shorts
Trendsetters’ fronts have recently been decorated by large logos.
Until a while ago, the fashion-conscious clothes avoided clear and large logos like Crocse's consana.
The advertising of a Hupper or T-shirt mark was somehow seen as a train.
But the times change.
Sporting has become a real fashion megatrend, and so old, well-known sports fashion brands like Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolius wave.
And, as so often before, the boundary of the funny and trendy is shy: if something is already right, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, that is, the custom mode, in which trendsetter surprised by popularizing the most boring basic clothes as a way to get separated from the mass.
Now, instead of the gray basic collage, it is placed on the bottom of the cabin that has been buried by the network, in front of which the manufacturer’s logo is comed.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, such as Adidas’ identifiable railboards, favourite team games and New York Yankees tickets have made the return to the street fashion.
Calvin Klein’s logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands also to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's shoulder clothes will make it clear what type of clothes it is about.
Would you be ready to present the logos in your clothes?
A Russian politician has revealed evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank for hours!
According to the allegations, a special interference would have occurred in the Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to pull out the large-scale Zotov from the tank for five hours.
Zotov has done everything in its way to challenge the information.
He even posted on his own public Facebook page a picture in which he appears to have a very good mood of a pansar vehicle and not at least on the basis of the pictures it is about any swallow or swallow.
Full of stupidity.
Let’s start with that I didn’t go into the battle tank, but it was a battle tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, everstile colonel, I have served in Ural.
I went there, looked around and came out calmly, Zotov said to Pravdal.
I didn’t swallow and I didn’t really spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian Army TV channel, Zotov explained in the exhibition his favourite Russian new technology, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, I loved our technology.
And I came out through the backyard, he said.
I went in all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I’m definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov was also foolish about the reporter who wrote about it.
One idiot wrote and all the others repeated.
Nothing like that was.
I went in and came out.
I'm long and rough, but nothing that I'd be somewhere stuck in the tank did not happen, he told Russkaja sluzhba novste radio.
Zotov’s words support the fact that no photographs of the alleged assassination have been published, although the assassination exhibition took place in a few days with a total of 50,000 people.
The claim of Zotov's injury began with the story on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told to his thumbs of the tanks when he tried to get out and eventually threatened to shoot all around him unless he got out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a subsequent story in which the exhibition organizers stated their own views of what happened.
Everyone is just accustomed to the fact that soldiers are jumping out quickly from the armored vehicles.
But Deputy Zotov, due to his great size, simply stopped when he came out.
But he was not sitting there for five hours, the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski told Bloknot.

Ville Korhonen to shoot Blues for the opening season

The Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland is in the Kittilän mine.
The cleansed process water of the gold trees has flowed from the so-called enrichment sand pool to the coast.
According to the company, measures to repair the damage have been initiated.
In the altar there is neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
Usually, water is pumped either to be reused as a processing water or, in accordance with permission, brought into the environment through the surface cleaning field.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of water is in compliance with the current license conditions.
There was no other material in the environment.
The accident was detected during a check-in on Monday morning.
No collapse has been found to have caused structural damage to the basin patal structures.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mining company employs approximately 600 permanent workers.
IMF warns to cut too much
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) today published Finnish land report is largely in line with the Government and the Ministry of Finance’s views.
The Organization has pursued structural reforms to cover Finland in order to overcome the economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overworking remunerations and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms are needed in the whole contractual system as well as unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäe, we agree on the structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates there are a lot of sympathetic messages to the government’s actions, but on the other hand there are also warning words about what should not be cut too much.
This is the case, for example, with infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to the Economy.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts that Finland will grow by 0.4 per cent this year, which will rise to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske today, in its new relationship forecast, predicts that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, the Statistical Center that the total production was in a small growth in the summer, Kuoppamäki said.
The industry’s weakened confidence or other so-called softer measurements could have been given less attention.
However, the difference is only a few percent decimal.
Nintendo has appointed a new manager.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwatan who died from cancer in July, will start his work on Wednesday, Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were highlighted as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track the footprints of Iwatan, assesses Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda to Reuters.
Kimishima’s mission is to bring Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but so that it doesn’t eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers come to Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency recognized that hundreds of children who have arrived in the country are missing each year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, there are hundreds of minors missing in the country every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, the supervisor of the Immigration Agency, tells us what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear "under the land" per year?- In Finland, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in 2013.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared.
The latter of the disappearance may be that in the process of the case it is established that the applicant has already been registered in any other country applicable to the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been identified as a full age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the processing of the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
In the same way, some of the missing people are also found later when they are seeking asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were withdrawn because the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past year, he says.
Is the number growing?
This year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for minors who arrived alone.
The total statistics of missing minors this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is therefore known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing, he emphasizes.
What about those who received the translation decision?
Are they going to go to the “dark market”?
This is difficult to assess by the Migration Agency, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the conversion decisions, Kannelmaa emphasizes.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered land aspirants.
He has taken action in this matter.
Orpo, who discussed the issues of refugees at the EU’s internal ministry meeting on Monday, said the practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of the device
Timo T.A., a media career manager who lost his workforce due to illness attacks, is now on sale with the equipment used for Mikkosen’s television and radio productions.
Mikkosen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced professional tools in her industry.
The first announcement was announced by the Webmaster.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained in the foot of technological developments.
In the digital media world, there are no more TV shows for Betacam groups.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be people interested in it.
Hardware, of course, is no longer up-to-date in this way, but it is also necessary as long as there is such a generation of material that needs to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of fans - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks of IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from their current Stormhouse.
We cannot bring all the goods with us.
I slowly started to invent and see what goods are delivered.
That’s what I’ve started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no more use of TV and radio devices.
After repeated strokes, it is clear that a long career man is no longer returning to work.
Nina Mikkonen notes that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's real life work was archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other materials from the Storm.
Traffic threatens to break worse than thought: Metro and railways can stop for the whole Friday
Metro and rail trains drivers will decide today whether to extend their forces in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and railway traffic only for the time of the protest on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
The main trust man Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
Night and mountain cuts harshly scratch the drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the additions raise opposition.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic throughout the day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and railway stops for Friday, the public transport is almost completely stopped in the capital region.
According to the news agency, trains will not run between Friday morning and afternoon.
On Friday there will be no traffic or traffic.
The trains departing before the morning will be taken to the destination stations.
According to HSL, the majority of the buses are on a varicose route.
The members of the ACT are left from work on Friday morning from three to three a.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven by the headquarters, HSL's spokesman Pirkko Repo estimates.
Repo says HSL is unable to tell exactly what buses will go on Friday.
Employers organize a mass demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Station on Friday at 11-13.

Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas, teacher thought his own clock was a bomb
In the U.S., 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher took his own clock to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present his electronic attack on the output.
One of the teachers, however, considered the clock like a bomb.
The police were called to the place, and the situation ended with the fact that the boy was taken in the hands of a young woman to the arrest card.
Mohammed has never claimed anything other than that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found that the clock looked like a “film bomb.”
The clock is in custody by the police, but it was composed of a circle plate and a digital display between which there were leaders.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedi was sentenced to three days in prison from school.
His father is angry about the case and the country’s American-Islamic Council is wondering if the case is again a sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
British Labour leader refuses to sing national song
In the song, God is asked to protect the kingdom, but Corbyn is the opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also agreed with the members of Corbyn’s Labour Party.
This has offended the people, Labour deputy Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have agreed to the song.
The ceremony was celebrated on the occasion of the British Air Force pilots’ battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and emphasizes that he has shown his respect for the pilots by participating in the opportunity.
We are all in great gratitude to the heroicity of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national song, the statement was emphasized.
Corbyn's election as a party leader has divided Labour's lines.
Especially among the MPs, there are those who are afraid that he will throw out moderate voters with their radical views.
Corbyn supports a unilateral assertion, the cessation of savings and the increase in public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled to appear today for the first time as a party leader in Parliament on the Prime Minister's questionnaire.
Corbyn has asked the public for proposals about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron announced on Twitter the election of Corbyn as a party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families.
The cause of the family murder in Minnesota is still unclear - the family's father was waiting for a trial
South Lake Minnetonka police have investigated the family murder in Greenwood in Minnesota for a week.
The five-person family was found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in a garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was worried about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for inspection and found a huge house from all over the shorts of the Short family as dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for several days.
Millionaire and a Successful Company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motivation for the blood is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 StarTribune interview, Short said that the site had four million different visitors per week.
I have received 50 purchases from the company over the past 10 years.
I have abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I will sell the company, but not yet.
Short’s family bought a house from Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as the car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
The legal case ongoing
According to StarTribune, the family’s father was waiting for a trial.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers various prepairing courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, short’s website did not remove prepairing comments, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Vesu Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner's triangle was awarded in the nutrition event with the Finish Hippos's Month Horse Owner Award.
This is great, Loiri commented charitablely on his honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused with Fabrice Duo's success in the Grand Prix.
I still don’t think that has happened.
According to Loire, the success coach Korpi gets full work peace while working with the horse.
The team will decide where the horse will be brought to the competition.
And I’m holding my thorn, Loiri scratches.
The NHL star's incredibly amazing gesture - "the greatest donation made by an athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital’s report, this is the largest individual donation done by an athlete ever to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital in other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year and $72 million contract with Canadiens a year ago.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly greater than his $9 million annual revenue.
As a prize for his donation, Subban receives a wave room from the hospital with his name.
Canadian players have previously contributed significantly to local hospitals.
The long-term captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, collected millions of dollars, among other things, for the same children’s hospital and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for the other city’s major hospital, bringing the PET scanner needed for cancer studies to the hospital.

More than 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against the security of cars began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the industry.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct continuous security tests and audits aimed at standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel has released the first version of the best cybersecurity practices.
The company will update the report on the basis of the results of the ASRB research.
The international ICT research and consultancy company Gartner estimates that by 2020 about 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share data based on the web.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, CEO of Intel Security.
ASRB allows Intel to establish security-related best practices and support the vision that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB council the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.

Kim Kardashian's Mother's Style Is Revealed - Now It's Showing Breasts
True TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives themes one after the other.
She’s presenting her pregnancy clothes and breast clothes in gloriously sexy clothes last night at one American time when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian with her husband Kanye West’s clothes.
The black breast is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored breasts under the clothes in the flash of the blasts.
Last time, Kardashian was dressed in an Amatsonian maternity suit when she went to her friend for dinner in New York just a few days ago.
It was highlighted by the black overknees.
The third special maternity is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the presentation year had its pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you’re lonely, the competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to divide the idea that the model world would be of pure glamour and champagne party.
She made her own documentary Speaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls), where Leloup and her colleagues talk their mouths clearly about the model.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins from empty.
Although in the previous season you’d been posing in the houses of top designers, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces in the field, competing for work with concare.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is a continuous journey and can go through years so that the hostel is a hotel room or an apartment in which the fashion houses accommodate their model.
If you’re too young and a mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one sort of scratch.
An agent in New York may ask for a lost pounds, but in Paris then they say you’re too weak.
Getting a job is always a risk game.
During the Fashion Week, models and designers are constantly together and function as a support network.
When the fashion week ends, the difference is weak.
Models want this field because of the possibilities it offers, but they're fascinated by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
They want to be their own personalities.
Work makes the models feel that they are actors who have some role.
But in the work of the model can also express itself.
The show was held by Tory Burch.
New York City is currently celebrating a fashion week, where designers will unveil their next year model.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, shows the most unknown Apulanta music in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautalaa, the founder of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta group.
Lautala founded Apulan in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the band in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me, because I’m a rap artist who will be 26 years old, and in this film I’m presenting a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I didn’t want to meet the right Ant before the descriptions because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people about that band, so I think it’s quite good that I teach her playing style only by video.
I don’t want to imitate a man.
A man who trusts the Roope Salminen and Dogs group is not the source of the role.
Punk-maners come according to the man in nature.
In the punk season of the Star, the Star program, many of you will surely see the example, as well as if you’ve ever visited our cakes.
Our appearance has never been a little bit, but we are always going full.
At the support of the 1993-2004 bass playing Tuukka Temosen directed Teit of us beautiful film the main actors were announced today.
The band's core group, which has become known to the public, is presented to the large public by young actors still quite unknown.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukkia presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave tips about her future washing already yesterday evening, when she told Snapchat that she’s mysteriously preparing for her career’s most important day.
Roope has already posted a picture on Instagram of his new look, which he has to make for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the weekly and leukaparras, has turned his face siloposky, and painted his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have been thinking about how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking to Europe.
Or is it worth telling it at all?
It is not necessary to take it as a strong speech, a member of the crisis group of the SPR, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting younger children, and not, for example, let them watch news alone.
Small children aren’t always able to understand what they see, and it can stop turning in mind and worry, he says.
However, if the child has met on television news photos of refugees or has heard of it elsewhere, it is worth taking it as a talk.
It is good for the discussion to go from the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child’s fears can be surprising.
They may not necessarily be those that the parent thinks he's afraid of.
It is not necessary to fear the child, even if he is worried and scared.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Bigger children are likely to encounter a conversation about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not all people in the world are well.
Parents can, together with their children, think about how our family is treated with this.
Is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This can be beneficial for him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weak"
Your strength at the end?
You can be a good parent for your child.
Vermoon Pallosalama is difficult to overcome
In the middle of the day, the Pallosalam was hit by Apila Pallosalam.
It only broke victories and doubles until the end of July there was a collapse in the Tampere rays.
As the orphan hunted to the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his protector time from the veterinarian.
The explanation of the disappearance was revealed in the starlight.
The horse had a headache.
The disease was not from the slightest to the slightest, but it needed two medications.
Since Apila Pallosalama had to be on a light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the horse's last race.
It was the second record in the market after the Storytelling.
The Apila Pallosalama was very stressed from the break, when it had been able to drive normally for just a few weeks.
These things considering a small tendance in the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made the orphan a sharp.
The horse was going forward, and hopefully it would also be balanced.
It has been the so-called humour.
If he did not enjoy it, he was able to throw it out without getting sick.
On the good day of the orphanage, instead, there has been such a spell that the opponents have been in their miracles.
At a fixed speed, the competitors will not be able to reach the Pallosalam, from which even warm-blooded cows will get rid.
In the basement there is a desire in Vermo.
The difference, however, is how the Apila Pallosalama agrees to it.
It’s quite difficult at the time of departure and can even put a fine under the road of the departure car and so on.
I hope it will be more quiet than when I go.
Apila Pallosalama will be able to get out of the ball as well, and we’re going to drive with it for the victory, the coach promises.
That's why you won't get rid of the useless iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of Apple’s iPhone phones’ upcoming programs may sometimes be deleted in the future – but not all of them.
Apple is likely planning to remove some of its own apps from its iPhone phones in the future, said CEO Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed.
Apple’s iPhone contains a series of programs that are relatively few to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newspapers, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest add-on to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a compulsory introduction to iPhone phones, although it’s only necessary for Apple’s smartwatch owners.
Cook says the deletion of Apple’s programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems anywhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don’t work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the case because it does not want to waste memory from iPhone users.
Inflation in the Eurozone fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, 0.1 per cent of the year, the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices led to the lowering of energy.
The Eurostat reviewed the 0.2% forecast a little down from a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell in August to 0.9 percent from 1.0 percent in July.
The Eurostat forecast for the base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy was 7.2 percent cheaper in the euro area last month than a year ago.
In the 28 EU countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
The increase in July was 0.1%.
More than 1.4% of consumer prices rose in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest in prices falling by 1.9 percent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 percent minus according to the harmonised EU price index.
Inflation in the eurozone remains strictly far from the European Central Bank (ECB)'s target, which is an estimated 2% price rise in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an inflation rate of 0.1 per cent for the euro area this year.
The next year, the increase will rise to 1.1 per cent, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts published in early September.
The U.S. Fed is trying to strengthen monetary policy.
The next U.S. recession will begin at the fastest rate in less than a year, but more likely in three years after the U.S. central bank (Fed) will begin to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline in turn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has announced that it will start interest purchases this week and by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed up at its fastest by the coming autumn and as the financial market currents before it.
Or at least this will happen if the world’s largest economy and financial markets act as they’ve used to – and if they react to the Fed’s money push as they’ve done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its international big customers last week.
The strategists prepared the survey and the report do not believe to know exactly when the Fed will begin to raise its interest rates or what in the economy and markets will happen after that.
Instead, through their cool facts and calculations, they present the economic statistics how the economy and markets have behaved in the time and after the Fed’s interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they look at what the key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different model as in the time of previous interest rates - and what is likely to follow from it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a much greater condition to stand the interest rate rise than once before the 1950s.
It may not be the beginning of recession.
The leaders who decide on the monetary policy of the Fed and its current trend have indicated throughout last summer and early autumn that the time has begun to be mature to raise interest rates.
The first rise of interest over nine years may occur this week.
The issue will be resolved on Wednesday and Thursday as the Fed’s Board’s so-called Open Market Committee will meet to resolve the issue on its two-day meeting.
For the first time, the Fed increased its so-called Fed funds interest rate in June 2006.
That ended the two-year series of relatively regular but at a time small 0.25 per cent interest rates, with the Fed raising its interest rates from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The financial market syndrome began in 2007 with the US’s most risky housing financing difficulties, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global nightmare on the Day of Judgment.
A great recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the serious disadvantages in the financial markets and the real economy began to slow down than the previous Fed interest rates typically occurred.
In the same way, the trials were then harder and harder than once before the 1930s.
Deutsche strategists have scaned the rise and falls of the world’s largest economies, as well as the turnover of the financial markets since 1950 and in places all since the beginning of the 19th century.
The interest rates of the Fed and their economic and financial impacts have been revealed since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, the fastest time since the first interest rate has passed is less than a year, mostly less than three years and an average less than three and a half years.
The growth of the financial markets has ended within two years from the start of the Fed interest rates.
The Fed has slowly raised and slowly decreased its rate since the beginning of the 1950s by a dozen unlimited cycles.
Each time has varied in some ways from the other, and the times are considered relatively low, so on their basis we can hardly conclude any certainty about the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategists remind that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis were not necessarily identified by decades of research.
But three facts that led to the crisis and the causes that increased its destructive power are probably somewhat undisputed:
1) The Fed, the Eurozone ECB and other major central banks in the world kept their currency interest rates too low in the 21st century for too long.
They fixed the traces of the tech group, and at the same time raised the next one.
(2) The amount of debt accumulated over the decades in the various parts of the financial and real economy, and yet too much, increased even more due to the influence of the monetary policy of the central banks’ surplus.
It was the biggest debt in history.
3) In particular, the crazy debt financing packed with the financial funds, which was closest to the financial funds, spread to most parts of the financial markets the biggest currency doubles of the previous financial history, from shares to real estate, bonds and goods.
Nevertheless, there is hardly a very severe controversy that the financial markets that rise to the heights due to the increasingly complex debt faults were rarely in a dangerous and unstable situation, when the Fed and other central banks last put interest rates up.
The financial structures incurred to the debt faults received the valuation faults did not last until their time after the interest purchases had begun and the debt financing costs had turned to rise.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
More money and more debt
Deutsche strategists don’t guess what’s going to happen, but they give the subject to the subject by mentioning, for example, the following kinds of facts:
The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy currents even lighter even longer than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for a long time before the crisis, they would have been even lower for a long time.
For a long time, debt has not been as crazy as ten years ago, but now the debt is literally cheaper than the free.
Thus, the financial and real-world economy has not leaked in debt, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt burden is drastically more heavy than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has become even cheaper and cheaper from the central banks has mostly remained in the financial markets and has stumbled the key securities and assets to its most expensive since the peak prior to the financial crisis or ever.
Not only are the strategists the Latin atmosphere with financial market warnings, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the most severe recession to the model that has ever been.
The economy of the Eurozone has hardly recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusual weak state, but the pressures and risks on the financial markets are unparalleledly greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed will subsequently start striking its fundraising to stricter.
Per the image of the future of the French bank’s Societe Generale strategist Albert Edward’s is not as strange as it can impact.
He has for a long time trained the bank’s international investor clients for the following full provisions of the Fed:
First the Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial doubts will explode – and soon it’s time for the Fed to shut down the financial doubts with even greater QE currencies.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer company, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the discounts are aimed at HP’s corporate service, the company says.
In November, HP will be divided into the company Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer-oriented PCs and printers.
HP’s staff was the highest in 2011, with a total of 350000 employees.
Last year, the number of employees was reduced to 30,000.
The company accounts for $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) of one-time expenditure.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce 25,000 to 300,000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business in such a way that no one of its customers will no longer be responsible for more than 10 percent of its turnover.
In the next year, its three major customers brought 65 percent of the turnover.

General: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the Tax Paradise Company
Transport and Communications Minister Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
The company is associated with the so-called tax planning.
It is a luxembourgian company Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner remains a member of the government.
Berner himself says he has resigned from membership in May of this year.
I checked it and it was enough that I left a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on a agreed schedule, Berner says Yle in an interview.
Membership after the Fusion
Through the Luxembourg Company, the property of the Swedish company Kährs is managed.
Kährs is a parket manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served in the Karelia-Upoflor government from 2010 to 2013 and after the merger in the Kährs government and in the Luxembourg company.
According to the above, the property of Kährs passes through the multilateral property structure in Luxembourg.
Berner says to Yl that he accepted government membership in the luxembourgean company Kährs at the request of the second-largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the Karelia-Upoflor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was searched for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to take care of the realization of the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the revenues of our Finnish companies’ capital are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner says to Yl that Hartwall Capital’s ownership in the company is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex property structure set up in the tax parish is due to the fact that the capital fund Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, had a luxembourgean holding company already ready for ownership.
A reception center is opened by the company
In Espoo Otanyama, the first reception center for adult asylum seekers will be opened by the company.
The reception center is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from this afternoon.
The number of places can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Immigration Agency establishes a reception center for the property of the former Rescue Institute.
The activity is managed by Luona Oy, whose activity is in particular the production of healthcare and nursing services.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the center.
STTK prepares an alternative work-life striking package
The STTK is starting to prepare an alternative package for the government’s working lives.
The organization also wants to participate in other wage organizations.
President Antti Palola said the attention is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative methods to lower the price of work will be returned afterwards.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola noted the organization’s administration meeting at a break for journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Trade Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have estimated that the change assurance contained in the government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated €30 million, while the other side of the package is €2700 million.
I don’t know if the party has a terrible passion to go to a conversation if there is one relationship with one hundred.
The dialogue was constructive.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as then the government is to give a message to the parliament on its own package and begin preparation for the reforms.
He did not know if the schedule was realistic.
The dialogue with the government has, according to Palola, existed, and it has been constantly constructive for him.
The staff center organization STTK’s field, especially Sunday’s operations, is a painful place according to Palola.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from a compulsory legislation that it would implement some of the exploits.
In the STTK, according to Palola, there is no warming for the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP that had the subject.
Employers will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the government’s last week presented work-life striking package.
As part of the package, the salary for the first days of illness will be cut, overwork compensation will be half, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 percent, and vacation will be shortened.
The STTK emphasizes that the central organizations have invited employees to demonstrate and did not intend to arrange a strike.
Feyenoord grateful
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder congratulates STTK on the announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STTK will now come to the same lines with Akava, as in Akava an alternative model for government proposals has already been drawn up for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without SAK the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come to prepare the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change and work-time projects.
Akava said on Wednesday that it has long prepared its own proposal, with which it is ready to negotiate the country’s government to pursue a 5% competitiveness drop as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been constantly ready to negotiate, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to see the terms and conditions of the service relationship as part of the contract.
In contrast, we want change security and work-time projects, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akava lines, as STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the country’s government and employers, Fjäder says.
The work committee will meet on Thursday at 5 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talcoats" - playing bingo when speaking in the evening
Green Left University of Tampere
The University of Tampere Green Left Viva Bingo Cup for the evening.
The Prime Minister has previously held exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälé rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland’s economy on Ylen channels on Wednesday afternoon at 21.05.
The request for the previous speech of the prime minister must go to the year 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister while holding a famous radio interview that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälé rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers held a number of broadcasts during the Winter and Continuing War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held President Mauno Koiviston instead of New Year's Speech, but it was more a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train makers’ strike with a television conversation.
Monarchism, Monarchism and Monarchism
The speech of Sipila has raised criticism and speculation throughout the day about what will come.
Left union chairman Paavo Arhinmäki tweeted that "Sipilä could see his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, so that the speech would also be discussed."
According to the Greens, “a single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
SDP’s Erkki Tuomioja sentenced on Facebook that “monarchist thing: the prime minister tells the people what’s best for him.”
SDP’s chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipila’s dialogue: “I’ve been a half year since the elections.
There is no presence of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
has been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the state council, the speech of Sipila is recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, this was commented in a direct broadcast by SAK’s chairman Lauri Lyly and EC’s executive director Jyri Häkämies.
It is generally criticized by the speech of Sibiu.
We considered the matter and stated that it belongs to the task of the public service to promote the comprehensive publicity of all of Finland, according to Ylen publications director Ismo Silvo Ylen in the news.
As we were in the time.
The speech has also caused disagreements.
After the evening, dinner is pleased in good time, the children are sheltered and dressed in their best.
The mother puts the column on her, and the father adjusts the nod on her neck.
At nine a.m. we are silent on the front of the television as before Me Tammeloe’s time,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Why does the Prime Minister Sipilä, in his speech, also explain why in the Finnish government there are millions who hide their capital in the tax parishes, who make compassion laws to their other tax evacuation friends and at the same time claim to the people that it is forced to cut when the money is over from the state?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left Viva University of Tampere.
It has posted a bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear at night of the same boat, the common coal, the debt of life and the team spirit?
Coupon and pen ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to exclude al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia’s offer to resign Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaare, the Russian Ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan that al-Assad would be withdrawn from power elegantly after some time.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall over a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaare, Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed him in a bilateral discussion three points of the plan: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to get a conversation immediately, and the withdrawal of al-Assad had to be carried out mildly.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not necessarily agree on all things, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told her what I did there and she said to sit in Alas, Martti, so I'll tell you what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers in a Guardian interview.
The diplomats do not comment.
Ahtisaari said he had sent a message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to Ahtisaare there are no two words about it.
The United Nations diplomats also refused to comment on the allegations of Ahtisaari, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed a number of mass murders at that time and key opposition groups refused any agreements he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East department of the UK’s Foreign Ministry, addresses Ahtisaari’s speeches with doubts because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss al-Assad’s fate.
Russia has officially supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaar's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with the authorization of Moscow.
If he had told me about Churkin's speeches, I would have answered that I want to hear the same president Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have been suspected in that case that it would have been a matter of Putin's holding power by some of the al-Assad supporters.
Refugees in our own actions
During the Ahtisaari talks, approximately 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220,000 in the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own.
I don’t see any other option than to take care of these rough people.
We now pay the invoice that we have made ourselves, says Ahtisaari to the newspaper.
The Refugee Organization Centre in Turkey
The Government’s Northern Finland Refugee Organization Centre is likely to be established in Turni.
The center will be established in the empty Tornion Community Building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has searched for a suitable place to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat on Tuesday that the committee had already decided to present the school building as a spatial solution to the ministry.
The deputy chairman of the city council, Sauli Hyöppisen, said this is not true.
When the entire delegation was not gathered and a part of the crowd wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he specifies to the STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates at the meeting.
There were 13 representatives opposed.
We can expect the decision to be positive, he says.
Mayor Timo Nousiaisen said the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was reacted quickly.
It is estimated that there will be 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has gone to check whether it could be applied to such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense, Nousiainen says.
The U.S. continues to hope for an alternative to strikes on the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central), the half reduction of the vacation funds in the public would only take care of a part of the government’s aim to calculate the price of work.
According to him, the government will, however, be pleased to accept an alternative package if the social organizations succeed in an agreement.
She told reporters that she had not been in contact with social organizations.
He also didn’t know how seriously the organizations are looking for a replacement for the government’s announced labor outbreaks.
If such a contract occurs, we will welcome it with pleasure as part of the entire package.
Halfing the vacation funds would be a functional means, because it would affect almost all wages, unlike, for example, the government’s plan to cut Sunday holidays.
The social organizations could agree with each other about the cutting of vacation funds because they are registered in trade agreements rather than in law.
The Government will tell the parliament on Wednesday about the strikes in labor as a state council announcement.
I say the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
The final limit is not that either.
Legislative work starts then, i.e. the train is moving and it becomes more and more difficult.
Now there is a good time.
It doesn’t take a long time in such a matter, if there is a will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published last week by the Government includes, among other things, the conversion of the final and light thirst to unpaid holidays without shortening the yearly working time.
In addition, the salary for the first days of illness is cut, overwork compensation is half, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75 percent, and holidays are shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as a compulsory legislation over the trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
Employers’ central organizations are holding a mass demonstration on Friday because of their actions, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi authority approved the extension of the Sugar Hall stock
The Tohmajärvi authority unanimously, but slightly, approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. the Sugar Hall stock.
The assessment was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than it was initially mentioned.
Also a busy schedule.
It was also somewhat surprising that the land demand was not known a year ago when the decision was made on the previous extension.
At this stage, the extension of the stock at 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment program, but the funds are determined as more imported in the context of the annual report.
The agenda also discussed the investment of €150,000 to €200,000, but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be €300,000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the locality.
The city has no risk, because the company pays the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
The language of Karel is in the river.
The city government relieved its previously sharp stance on bringing carelong-speaking street mines to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in the mind of the rise of the carnivorous tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the Karel language because it has no historical grounds and the Karel language is not a natural part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the region of Yunnan has become more part of the Eastern Savola Murtis.
After the new decision, there will be no carlanguage street names in the city center.
However, the city of Joensuun is, by good consideration, ready for the use of the Karela language, for example, in the infotables and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude the city recommends to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-language municipality, the use of the Karel language should also be approached spatially now that the multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in the North Karel.
The language of Karela is still the specific features of the province, as well as the image of Joensuus as the entire Finnish forest capital.
Both of them can be beneficial in the various types of marketing in the province.
The interruption of railways cuts the vitality of the province
Cuts of railway connections strike the province with a hard hand.
Transportation connections have a direct impact on the industry and competitiveness of the province.
And that’s what it affects whether you can live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Karijalainen wonders.
He also highlights the air traffic, which has also been continued several times in the report.
It is important for the entire countryside that our possibilities to overcome are not reduced by the measures of the state power, as it is now going on.
The impact of these interruptions of traffic connections should be seen, for example, on employment, Karjalainen emphasizes.
The deterioration of traffic connections causes an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Indeed, the better services here are, such as traffic connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He notes that poor traffic connections also affect the research team, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to the research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that already at the moment, the university’s marketing toward West Finland is difficult because the traffic connections are weak at the same time.
Approximately half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland are currently from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 percent of them are from New Zealand, which is partially explained by direct railway.
The river became one of the worshippers of the war.
The view of the Joensuun municipal government on the province’s Siun war project is apparently unanimous, but there is one among the speakers.
Member of the City Government, Pentti Keskisalo (s.d., in the picture), on Monday's meeting of the Government proposed to give up the entire project, but his proposal was unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a resolution by the Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised in early October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all the other municipalities.
One train ride from Kouvola to Kotka ends next year
The personal train transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although the number of passengers is less.
There will be changes in personal trains between Kotka and Kouvolan in March.
One train pair goes away, but still five times a day you get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
This is due to state savings.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ rail transport purchase expenditure for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The most quiet routes will be completed.
VR will set up new schedules by the end of the year.
It will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the boys lived from the place.
The rescue team released a 12-year-old man who climbed from the roof and was unable to get down from the roof by his own help.
The incident occurred in the Tower of Ketoti at half a six a.m. Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house, with no roofs to get to the roof at all.
It didn’t stop the boys, who decided to climb to the roof of the house along the radioamaters’ threshold next to it.
The other men came down the same path, but one didn’t.
The result was that the others lived from the site and the passengers warned the rescue facility to the site to help the veterans safely return to the ground.
FedEx's turnover variation, weaker prospects for the financial year 2016
FedEx has announced its weak outcomes for the last quarter. the transport industry has weakened its year-round outcome forecast due to the decrease in the demand for cargo services and increased land transport costs.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for a vacation period.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5 percent 45 minutes before the opening of the real trade on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial year ending in May. The forecast is a drop of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to a study by FactSet, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated in average despite price increases of 4.9 percent. The increases will enter into force on 4 January. Additional fees for heavy or large-scale land transport will enter into force in November.
The company continues to expect outcome growth from the previous year thanks to cost cuts, greater turnover and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has succeeded well than expected in a weaker economic situation, which has tested production and global trade.
The seasonal workers’ hiring plans were announced a day after the competitor UPS announced its plans to hire approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, 90,000 to 95,000 people.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx’s trade profits amounted to $692 million, which means a six-percent increase.
The result per share was $2.42, so the $2.44 forecast of 12 analysts from Zacks Investment Research was lost.
The turnover increased by five percent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has experienced a decrease in international first-class broadcasts, which has led to a decline in the company’s Express unit’s operations.
The strong growth in online trading has been confirmed by FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but business profits showed the increased costs of large-scale shipping and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic payments, while the revenue of the shipping business fell due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the real trading, FedEx’s stock price had fallen at $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock dropped 11 percent from the year’s average and 17 percent below the highest note rate on 11 June.
This week, the U.S. Central Bank’s Fed’s decision makers will meet for the most anticipated meeting of the years. The crowd runs on its diameter to the eight-metre Honduran wooden table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room, a wall painting represents the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Chairman of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues must place the financial interest of the state above all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices here stable.
After the massacre, the central bank’s leadership has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
On Thursday, the Central Bank is expected to announce whether the U.S. economy is ready to start a deviation from the unpredictable stimulus that the short interest rates that remained close to zero at the end of 2008 have offered.
Although most of the data indicate that the economy is growing stable, the recent trend in the financial markets can make the officials of a cautious central bank ready to maintain the increased volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate – even a quarter of the percentage.
“The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse to not raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global markets is to give enough reason to wait yet," Piegza continues.
Those considering the matter are not consistent with what the central bank is planning to do, which already in itself causes nervousness.
Approximately half of economists in a Bloomberg survey found interest rates rise this week.
In the financial market, however, the central bank is expected to wait, and according to the main indicator there is only a 30% chance of a rise.
If the central bank raises its control rate, the share rates can decline unless the decision makers soft the blow by promising another rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fell 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
“The backdrop of the relief was expectations that the central bank will keep the control rate stable this week,” said Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group’s chief economist John Lonski.
“It would be a surprise if the central bank would raise interest rates at this stage,” he said.
"If this happens, the central bank should think carefully about how to keep the hands of those operating on the financial markets untouched."
On the other hand, experts pointed out that raising interest rates could calm the financial markets and eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Just a month ago, the central bank seemed to tend to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month. This would be the first small step to strengthen the financial conditions and thus to strengthen the U.S. recovery.
Over the course of the spring and early summer, he said he expected the interest rates to rise this year – despite the liberal claims that economic progress is needed.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 per cent last month. Its level is now at the lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the central bank is calculating to complete employment.
Wages appear to be exciting.
While inflation continued to fall below the central bank’s annual 2% targets, the central bank’s decision makers pointed out that the main reason for this is the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can handle even higher interest rates and it needs them as long as they take into account the strict situation on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the world’s financial markets did not slow down last month when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped up to 16 percentage points from the record high in May and investors feared that China’s recession would also impact global growth.
The market has scattered this month, and Dow Jones has now dropped almost 10 percent from the top in May.
The trending of the market means that the decision makers of the central bank are making it even more difficult to think about the rise of the control rate.
"The work of the central bank is complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and what news about the decline of the Chinese economy has been drawn over the past few weeks," said Ziman Center for Real Estate senior researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Oliner.
Now he believes the central bank has to wait at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is a great uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy. There is little reliable information about the situation after the recent development of the Chinese economy," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, the central bank is the most influential entity in the world’s monetary economy.
The influence of the central bank has been huge in recent years.
In 2013, the only indication from the then president Ben S. Bernanke that the central bank could reduce its scope caused mutations around the world.
In today’s world, the markets and economies are closely linked to each other. In addition to monitoring global developments, the central bank also requires contact with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overview of the world economy.
“Central Bank’s decision-making process is more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, CEO of Envestnet Inc’s global strategy.
Chairman Jeffrey Lacker of the Regional Central Bank of Richmond said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem to have no connection with the basic pillars of the economy.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has followed the rise of the control rate. He raised an example of the decisions made in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian economic crisis led to the central bank's decision in three meetings to lower the currency rate by 0.75 per cent points, although there were only limited recognizable sanctions available for the U.S. economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank cancelled the decision.
“The central bank should put monetary stability on the first place only in a major crisis, such as the 2008 economic collapse,” said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England’s interest committee.
The last shock does not even approach this situation,” he said.
“The rise of interest rates in no way is worth afraid because of the market shock,” said Posen at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention the stability of the monetary economy. Before this changes, I don't have to go ahead of things."

Brazilian Rio Grande Association of Pediatrists promotes a proper diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Rio Grande Association of Pediatrists SPRS has developed a candy way to teach breastfeeding women the importance of a proper diet. They are presented with images of babies breastfeed from the breast, which is painted with images of unhealthy food.
The human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. Thus, the baby gets all the food he needs and he can develop a strong immune system.
Due to the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 kilokalories.
According to a new study, in addition to increasing calories, other changes in the diet should be made.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet has been found to have a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven Sunrise has the most viewers, although Nine tries to get the lead position in his Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson refused Canberra to make a morning program on the post-election of the Liberal Party’s leadership, which, however, did not much improve the audiences of Today.
The Nine Channel's morning program was broadcast from the capital Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage’s competitive channel’s morning program, in turn, was broadcast from London. The program’s week-long special broadcasts are also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance seemed to have no importance for Australian television viewers, as Sunrise was viewed by an average of 397 000 viewers in five state capitals, and Today was viewed by 339 000 viewers.
Today's viewing numbers increased slightly compared to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but last Thursday remained reading (343,000).
Today has shut down the distance to Sunrise in the last months.
Today had an average of 318,000 viewers in August and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349,000 viewers and Today has reached 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The wind changes will affect the parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the question!

Seven has a 800 Words series with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The news drama tells a recent widow father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have doubted whether it would be enough for Thomson to be the star of the hit series alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to the publication, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor retained a strong position with 1,136,000 viewers. The series brilliantly hit The Block (838,000) and TBL's Families (726,000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers varied.
The first half of Andrew O'Keefe's new series (17.00-17.30) followed an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half (17.30–18.00) the number of viewers grew to 623 000, which was as if more than Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia in the first half had an average of 520,000 viewers, and the second half collected a huge 720,000 viewers.
The number of viewers was 620,000.
The Chase Australian's second evening viewers showed to the Nine channel that the Hot Seat will be over again at 17.30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minutes, which failed to challenge McGuire's series.

The Final Three says Sam Wood is really the Son of Dreams – but who is the man to choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski unintentionally revealed the choice of the Dream Boyfriend.
The final choice of the Dream Boy Sam Wood has been a thoroughly protected secret.
The remaining three women don’t say a word about who has received the last rose from the boyfriend.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about the mood before one of the three was stumbled.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
The women praised the man's humor, ambition, family values and positivity, and regarded him as a suitable partner for himself.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose didn’t touch their place, their answers could give an indication of who takes the boyfriend’s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Everything between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been easy from the beginning.
"When I arrived at home, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were well together. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has his feet on the ground, and he's really fun to follow," Markoski added.
“I have seen them together, and I have to admit that there is chemistry between them.
They influence the nature of the couple.
Sarah Mackay considers herself and Sam Woody a good couple.
Mackay said he realized at a home city meeting last week that Wood could be the right one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family along, I realized that this was not just a race. I now bet on our relationship full," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if the man didn’t choose him, the woman answered mysteriously:
“I can’t say,” he said.
"I like the other girls as much. Snezana and Lana are equal."
The Dream Boy on the Ten Channel on Wednesday at 19.30.

Jarryd Hayn has several options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayn after this changed to the United States. Also, several other branches were interested in the man after the last year's impressive open exercise day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice appears to be touched by the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the pen, as the man did in the Australian rugby team's row. Hayne shed the airplane return situation to the team for the victory spent on Tuesday from Minnesota with a score of 20–3.
However, Tomsula demonstrated confidence in Hayne and gave the man a new opportunity to restore the airplane. The coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula continued his line in the clothes after the game.
He did not steal the finalists in front of the other team, but encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference held after the game.
49ers’ special reporter Cam Inman that Hayne was also encouraged by the special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne shakes in the first quarter of the game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been waiting for another man from the NFL debut.
After the failure, Hayne left the field by a hundred and later told the 2DayFM 104.1 channel to Hamish and Andyl that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL rally.
“They are hurt, and we have to move forward,” Hayne said.
Hayne made a mistake in his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his entrance in his own area opened a place for Queensland.
The experience was incredible for a 27-year-old man.
Hayne posted a picture on Instagram in which she poses together with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, the wealthiest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun threat at the airport in Siberia.

Four people killed by police shooting demonstrators in Nepal
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, a official source said on Wednesday. Police shot a crowd on rubber boats in a demonstration against the country's alleged new constitution. Among the victims was a four-year-old boy.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region, less than three hundred kilometers from the capital, Kathmandu.
District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakali said more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and firefighters.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and shot in the air before the rubber strikes were shot.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It is not completely clear why rubber wheels, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive alternative, suddenly were so deadly.
This was the latest confrontation in the week-long protests in the southern coast of Nepal, where Madhesi-heimo said the new provinces based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus heimo demands its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police, have died in the violent cacao since August 10,
This is a significant step towards a new constitution, but the topic is very narrow in Nepal, where the government has been concentrated for centuries.
The new constitution has been drawn up since 2008, but legislation has accelerated the process after the shocking April earthquake killed thousands of people.
Legislatives have voted on the constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and the authorities say the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
About 560 kilometers from the large low-pressure area, the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde Islands are 60 percent likely to develop a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Institute of Meteorology, there is also a clear low-pressure center in the middle of Cape Verde and the Little Antilles. It can also be 60 percent likely to develop into a tropical cyclone over the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced its launch of a campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations that help thousands of people flee from war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign in its blog in a personal way.
Instead of leadership, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud by telling her own experiences. She was only seven years old when she fled from Kabul with her family.
“We traveled in the dark with a train and a bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the European refugee and immigrant crisis, many families in the similar situation are heavily in need of help.
Donations are allocated to non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations Refugee Organization.
When donations have been collected via google.com/refugeerelief for $5.5 million, Google promises to donate the equivalent amount, the total amount of which exceeds $11 million.
The situation is worse since World War II, especially the four-year civil war in Syria, which has caused more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war will also have to escape from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Slightly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, slightly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-operative treatment.
“It takes time to obtain mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon, who discussed the new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
With obesity surgery or bariatric surgery, the stomach is reduced by different methods.
The surgical methods reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been shown to be effective treatments for type 2 diabetes. However, most studies have affected patients with a sick overweight with a weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index indicates weight and length with a normal value of 18.5 to 24.9.
When the weight index is above 25, a person is overweight, and the weight index above 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan took advantage of the data collected since 2007 in a study that compared two methods of obesity surgery, gastrointestinal transplantation and cavity surgery, with drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in gently obese people.
After the obesity surgery, the average weight index fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The weight index of those who received non-operative treatment remained at 29 points.
Diabetes was completely healed by 36 percent and partially by 28 percent.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes completely healed by only 1 percent and partially only about 2 percent.
According to the study, blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were also better in the group of people who received surgery.
The researchers also followed the levels of hemoglobin-A1c in patients, which describes the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended level of hemoglobin-A1c is less than 7%.
After the surgery, the hemoglobin-A1c level decreased from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the group of those receiving medication, the value remained equal at approximately 8%.
The level of hemoglobin-A1c indicates the control of blood sugar levels. However, a research group led by Tri Chih-Cheng Hsun found that this did not reduce mortality over the course of five years.
The research team also evaluated the consequences of two different methods of cutting.
In the fifth year in the gastrointestinal cutting group, weight loss was greater compared to the cutting group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), weight loss index was greater (7.4 and 5.1), as well as hemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent).
According to a Swedish Blackstone study at Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, surgery, however, brings years of life to obese people.
In a Swedish study, those obese people who were undergoing a gastrointestinal transplant surgery, the likelihood of death over 15 years decreased by 29 percent compared to the group receiving traditional treatment.
Although no lower mortality was found in the new study, Blackstone said it was confirmed that people with a weight index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the main discovery of the study, as it says that the surgery is safe in the group of lower weight index and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is 27-30.
“We’re waiting too long for people to take the situation seriously,” the researcher said.
"When a human body has accumulated genetic changes that are exposed to obesity and diabetes, it's really difficult to translate the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama - RT News
"Europe is unable to receive all the refugees," Dalai Lama said, "the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leadership has called for the cessation of violence in the country of refugees.
Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in a speech during his visit to the UK. Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity should be placed above individual countries or continents.
He also emphasized that although the resistance of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admired, it is not enough in this situation.
"There is an impossible idea that everyone could come to Europe," Dalai Lama said in his speech.
While Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for the action in the crisis, he emphasized that the solution was only temporary.
“To take care of thousands of refugees is a great act, but at the same time it is thoughtful about long-term solutions and how we can true peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education,” Dalai Lama said.
“We must ultimately consider how we can reduce the deaths in these countries.
Use of power should be reduced.
The problem has never been solved by means of force,” he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions in the context of the September 11 terror attacks and claimed that the U.S. had created an uncontrolled chain of events in response to the terrorist attack.
“After the 11th September attacks, I expressed my regrets to President Bush and told him that the solution comes through violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he applied to means that had unexpected consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
The number of infection cases increased by four in four years.
According to the Georgian Poisoning Center, poisoning centers across the U.S. report their alcohol content in strong hands sweating cases almost quadrupled in children under 12 years since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Toxicity Center, the number of hand-in-drying cases to the toxicity centers in children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly available to children, and unfortunately some of the children are suffering from first aid," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children are drinking their hands intentionally, partly to impress their friends and partly social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers who drink the desinfectant because of the cheap rubber.
It is recommended that the teens mix alcohol-containing mouth into the desinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of the hands.
“The child doesn’t think that the substance is bad,” Lopez said.
“Many of the attractive handmade products are just smelled.
There are hand-sweetened products available for corn, wine and apple that appeal to the children.”
The alcohol content of the desinfectants is 45–95%.
A small amount of alcohol can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content in the hand is extremely high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poisoning center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
“No one would leave whisky to children, but if hand desinfectants are often left to children, they will quickly get a large amount of alcohol.”
The six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently four grapes in her hands at school, and the girl was delivered to first aid to be treated.
“A girl’s blood alcohol content was 179, which is twice as much as an adult’s humidity,” says Chris Ritchey, a doctor who treated the girl, from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah suffered and couldn’t walk when he was brought to first aid.
The doctors followed the girl's condition overnight in a separate hospital for brain injury, as the girl had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey said.
"The situation was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectant towels in addition to the fact that your hands should be moved to children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two of Ontario women died by swallowing their hands, which contained a toxic substance that was not.
The health authorities suspected that the product contained deadly methane instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was indicated as an active substance in the product list.
According to a police report, three four-class students in the northern state of New York planned to kill a "light" teacher in January by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher was highly allergic to the hands and banned it from bringing it to the classroom.
The police found that the plan that went to the myth was meaningless and called for disciplinary action.

The Dutch want an old Scottish battle pair – de Boer
Former Rangers midfield player and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has stated that the interest of Dutch football fans for Celtics has stopped because they can no longer follow Celtics and Rangers' twins.
De Boer, who works at Ajax team management, said: “Netherlands is no longer showing Celtic’s top points.
“Rangers are no longer involved.”
“We’re not talking about the return of Rangers.
We are talking about the old company.
The Netherlands wants two matches between the teams.
Old Firm’s games have a huge tension, and they are also interesting outside Scotland’s borders.”
I'm going to make the situation good, Deila assures
RONNY Deila acknowledges that Celtic is in trouble, but a Norwegian speaker assures that the situation will change.
The team lost to Malmö fell from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead in the top of the table.
“Celtic has had difficult periods before, and we’re going to rise again,” Deila said.
“We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it raises in many hate or sadness.
We do so, but we have to move forward.
We need the support of Celtic’s supporters, as it will greatly strengthen the players.
Cooperation is really important now.”
Warburton's warning in January's player transfers
Although just a few weeks ago, Rangers Vice Mark Warburton indicated the January transfer targets, he is careful with the transfer and says he wants to compromise the team's unity.
"January's player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," Brentford's former coach said.
"The players who join the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has succeeded in our composition this season.
The team is going very well.
Sometimes unnecessary gambling can cause more harm to the team than benefit.”
Michu plans to retire from Celtic

Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was killed when the man admitted to the famous songs of the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn area before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match, and the atmosphere was vibrant," the attacker said. "I can guarantee that I won't go back to Tynecastle except in the Celtic row."

Unemployment continues to rise in Scotland
The number of unemployed remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July; 164,000 were unemployed; the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 at the same time.

Nearly exactly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to preserve as part of the United Kingdom.
The employment situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why do I follow execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for the withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I’m not hoping, I’ll sit in the execution room of a prisoner in the state of Oklahoma when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison spray.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
I received the invitation in January through the man's best friend and despite my shock I responded the invitation positively.
When the day approaches, I am scared.
Why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell a true story about the death sentence.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists will be able to follow the executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than places, participants will be selected on a layer by review.
Oklahoma has reduced reporter seats from 12 to 5.
The following execution was moderate.
I can’t do it.
I sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends. I have created a man's personal relationship because we've talked by phone over months several times, and one visit lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I can’t be present as a witness and as a reporter, so I can’t take a memo and a pen with me to make notes.
I just have to try to put the details into my mind.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of threatening neutrality.
“The basic idea is this:
When you tell the judged story to him in a pleasant way, you get close to him.”
I expressed my opinion to the reporter.
The reporter admitted that he could have formulated his word more carefully, but still considers my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreeed about some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't determine what I'm writing. And even if he would try to determine, I'd not obey.
I told him that he can remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist to write about what has happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will promote the movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will sit next to me.
If you want more information on this topic, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can’t say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of aid after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that the man Glossip has not committed murder.
I definitely believe that evidence for the death penalty was not sufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can’t say I’m totally unpartial.
The unpartial description can be read from the stories of other journalists.
I'm telling you what it feels to look at when a man dies in vain.
Man attracted from Canningjo after a police officer
The countryside of Canning Valen remained dry while attracting the man up from Canningjo.
The men's escape entered a low, mulled water. A few meters away, the police got the man landed back to the dry ground.
Canning Valen police received a call on unlawful stay in Beckenham on Tuesday.
After arriving at the site, the police found a suspect trying to punish the police by directing the Canning River.
But the man did not get far.
"The man standing in the water announced he would not come out of the water and called the police to get him into the water," senior superhero Shandell Castledine said.
Constaplus Lachlan Perhavecia's shell wasting was not attracted, so he chose a safer tactic – a negotiation.
"Sometimes an escape company makes people use fun means," the superman Castledine said.
The case of footballer Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned their car in order to avoid a police blow and tried to swim on the other side of the Swan River.
The man's company was convicted of destruction, but the temptation inspired the locals to design the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says reporters were trying to spy, and he threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has accused Racing Victoria’s dealers of spying for their charges last year and threatened to stop the competition immediately.
Moody claims that the journalists and the Racing Victorian Immortality Department have attacked her personally, and the rejection of Lady Tata due to recent childhood treatment was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to act for the competition. Moody has been in a difficult situation when a kobolt was found in the Lidar sample and the man was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his language in trial for a year and a half for spy accusations and did not want the accusations to influence the behavior of a brutal man.
“I’m thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration disappears at a time,” Moody said.
“They know what really happened.”
"Sometimes it is necessary to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well.
I want the owners of horses to believe that I will do my best.
If the owners don’t believe it, I don’t deserve to continue as a horse coach.
I’m going to think about my future as a licensed coach.”
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, in which he told the intolerance department’s spy companies in his warehouse.
“First and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man work in my warehouse in order to spy my actions.
“They clearly believe that I am a trick.
If so, they would be worth giving evidence, because I have not been caught for anything unlawful.
Former Chairman of the RVL Robert Roulston, current Chairman of the RVL David Moodie and current Chairman of the RVL Bernard Saundry were aware of the action then and now.
Should I consider the situation as a personal driver?
Should the RVL take real action and bear responsibility for the situation in the field to others other than the coaches?
Is it harmful to this sector?
Are we really harmful to this sector?
Per many people think so.
Per I will still get a training license and push me out of my tasks. There is no doubt that in my speeches I get many to think so.
But I’m at the point that I don’t care anymore.
It is really sad.
I press them to make their decision.
My family supports me and I can withdraw.”
The long-lasting investigation of Lidar's kobolt values and the recent rejection resulted in the worker's frustration in the end so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the Black Caviar coach. The man described the treatment rule of the day as laughing after the horse's legs were placed with a rope against the rules.
Treatment is contrary to the rules.
I take full responsibility for it,” Moody said.
“A person of my staff mistakenly put the horse on the foot.
The treatment could have been done yesterday night.
It could have been done yesterday, and so was it.
But that happened on the day.”
Moodya can wait for a three-month competition prohibition for the unregulated sewage, which the organizers have begun to investigate.
“This is a joke.
The rules are made by someone who doesn’t know the horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but here we’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Arrested man fleeing Cobram crash
Police have arrested a man who met his cyclist on a weekend when he escaped from the crash.
The cyclist was transported by a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital. He was seriously injured when a car crashed with him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who was driving the car fled from the site and was not allowed to help the wounded cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia to the Shepparton police.
The man is likely to be accused of neglecting the stop and assistance obligations in a traffic accident and other traffic violations.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still hospitalized and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy Reveals With Opponents
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy considers the criticism of his team's backgammon as an intentional action for NRL's two leagues.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm's pressure to the hosts of Melbourne in a carcass match in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett hardly covered the reference to the Storm after Broncos won in the carcass final on Saturday night in Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model game and stated that in Queensland there was no more attention to the weight.
Bellamy defended his team's backgammon and told them that they were just focused on the contact when they were backgammon.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was added by the fact that two top teams coaches criticized his team. Bellamy considers this as a proof that coaches are worried about losing to Storm.
"To remember, Trent Robinson didn't talk about anything when his team won us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
Certainly, we have not changed anything in our defense systems or technologies throughout the year. Over the last six weeks we have just invested in contact games and blocks, which has turned us to rise.
The loss could be a shock for him because he has a great team that is not used to losing.
It’s funny that the same thing happens at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what's interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing a boring football.
“Wayne talks about an interesting football.
He played his own team on Saturday for our Friday game and considered their game interesting," Bellamy said.
“In 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism to know about his boring game.Wayne said that the criticism did not take him a moment.
Now he has a team capable of playing the so-called football, especially his young, fast center attackers.
This kind of football wants to be played when the player-arsenal is like that.
He emphasized this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. Not all teams have central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more self-confidence of this when other coaches are so worried about facing my team that they’re taking such a way.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think they’d meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that in the Storm and Roosters game, more goals were made than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
Broncos' game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
Our match was 20–18.We had more situations in the game, but is it an interesting football?
Or are games and minority an interesting football?
My goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we’re probably going to meet them.”
Storm will have a free weekend as the team will get on Saturday to visit either North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man released $200,000 warranty against drug trafficking
A man who is expected to be sentenced to life for a company holding 40 kilograms of cocaine trafficked in Queensland has been released for $200,000 guarantee.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police found a hundred kilograms of cocaine from the Solay ship that had arrived through Vanuatu from South America and arrived in the port of Coomera in August.
The police observed the meeting of Maksimovic and his criminal colleague in the port during the morning and surprised the twins later from the Coomera Roadhouse cafe.
Although Maksimovicia is likely to expect a lifelong drug holding for commercial purposes, the man’s lawyer says there is no evidence that his boss would have tried to get the whole set in his possession, but that the man could have been in a cafe for innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to escape the country.
“Maksimovic has clear connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently,” the judge said in the court on Wednesday.
“He lie to the police of his residence.”
Maximovich's mother and father-party paid together 200,000 guarantees, against which the man was released.
"When I read both persons' voluntary certificates, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
“It alone is not enough to prevent the man from escaping,” the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on the condition that he gave out both his Australian and Serbian passports, registered to the police daily and stayed at home from afternoon to morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to take pictures of the children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged in to an online messaging service where she got another user to send herself inappropriate photos of the children.
Later, when the girl woke up, she noticed the phone was missing, and she noticed it was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she sparked the content of her phone, the girl found shocking messages and told her mother about it immediately.
After investigating the computers found on the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches that used search words to search for inappropriate children's images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he tried to deceive pedophiles on the Internet and presented the police with the intention to scare pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said at the local court at the Dundee Sheriff Court: “The man claimed he’s dependent on people’s intimidation.
He admitted that he was buried on a computer, but claimed that he did so to present the police and thus be able to scare pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent photos to him and whom Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that he intended to deceive pedophiles.
She said she got disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the messages were removed from the phone, the girl screamed on her mother and cried."
The girl saw inappropriate images on the phone, after which Hoggia was interrogated.
The girl said the accused used the computer and PlayStation to talk to the girls that seemed much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road acknowledged the accusations of possession of unfair child pictures on 14 June last year. Hogg broke his release against guarantees on 25 January this year and refused to come to court for hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hoggia not to enter the register of sexual crimes, as it could be considered that the crime did not contain significant sexual characteristics.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael delayed the sentence to October due to social work background reports.
Hogg was exempt from guarantees in this case, but he was held in detention on other grounds.
Hogg was included in the register of sexual crimes before the date of the judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe's wrong speech in parliament
The oldest African state leader Mugabe fell on the stairs leading to the speaker's height earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of the incident quickly spread on social media.
Parliament openings were also shadowed by the allegations of the opposition lawmakers’ allegations that they had received anonymous assassinations in which they were warned not to blame Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, the parliamentarians blamed and interrupted the speech on the situation of the president's state in Parliament.
MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) bishop Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages in which they were urged not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is 'death', Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that representatives outside the parliament are no longer within the limits of immunity.
The party’s bishop said the party led by Morgan Tsvangira is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the reorganization and savings of the business service business.
HP will be divided into two stock exchanges later this year, distinguishing from the faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations in the computer and printer business.
According to HP’s report, the company is recording $2.7 billion of single-quarter expenditure from the third quarter.
“Reorganizations will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said HP CEO Meg Whitman, who leads the company after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than HP today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business functions that help move to a new type of business,” Whitman said.
“As our company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world.”
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover is more than $50 billion and the company focuses on its mission to deliver unique integrated technology solutions to.
The company founded by Stanford University educators Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s is now divided into two. The Twin founded an electronics company in the garage located in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birth of the Hidden Valley.
HP has carried out massive reorganizations as it is moving from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices.
The changes of HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, are the latest transition in a sector that is believed to lead to success.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta: Team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before defeating Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also emphasized to Wilsher that it’s just September. If everything goes well on the rehabilitation plan, there’s no reason why he couldn’t return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will surely have to miss at least the next four English national teams. The hour of a man's history of his participation in the European Championship is clearly unclear.
The biggest disadvantage of the last problem is that Wilshere decided last season after a strong narrow and appeared to return to his former stone under a new season.
“Such a disorder does not threaten a career,” Wenger said.
“The liver has not healed well.
This is not a serious injury.
It was just an accident.
It was not associated with his nails or previous injuries."
Medicalally, it may be so, but as Wengerkin said, additional injury can come when a player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also an unpleasant regulation.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different efforts since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal in only 65 of a total of 157 league matches over the last five seasons.
In the six of eight seasons between 2007 and 2008, the team was the second to lose money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible puzzle, but Arsenal believes that the last season healed injury statistics will continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometimes the return after injury may be associated with a vulnerable period of time, when it is necessary to strengthen the body and seek competitive powers," Wenger said.
“Jack is a young man, so he will survive it.
I hope that he will get his body to a balance. I believe in it, and thus his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal will start its Champions League career on Wednesday afternoon against Dinamo Zagreb. Then the team will face Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday. Wenger is preparing for small changes to the composition.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely beginners.
Wenger can also put the initial composition in place of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to take care of the balance of the team and give time to those who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clearly the favourite F-Group followers, Maximir Zagreb has the most scary stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been unbeatable for the 41 game time team.
The stadium crashed on Tuesday after the earth flown at a 3.2 Richter scale.
The earthquake was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his last season's league after having to stick to Monaco. He is also motivated by the distant desire to lead the team to the European Championship.
“We have a huge energy flow,” Wenger said.
“Arsenal has not yet won this title.
We were very close in 2006 On the other hand, with the experience I am also realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreaming.”
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about friendship between men
This is noticeable, especially when it is taken into account that the need for men to open is greater than ever, and the suicide statistics of young men are at the highest level for 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) addresses the problem by proclaiming 2015 as the Men’s Year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent study interviewed 2,000 high school students.The study found that people with depression have better chances of healing if there are enough healthy people around them.
Also, the likelihood of infection in non-symptomatic persons fell by half if in their neighborhood were persons with no mental health problems.
Everything is based on friendship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often content more important. Quick response is often considered more important than relevant contact.
With the digitalization of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
Surface success is associated with externally coming values, money, image and social status. These all draw attention from internal values and from our natural desire for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
One video gaming millionaire recently stated that money cannot actually buy happiness.
The great thing to do was that the series turned the focus on the top.
None of the characters in the series were defined not by profession but by personality.
The series showed humoristically Joey and Chandler playing or watching football on their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often missing Rachel. It was clear that the men were able to identify with this, even though they did not refrain from feeling full.
One volunteer explained this to me as follows: “When I listened to depressed and suicidal people, it became clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who get in touch with us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men have to deal with is strong; a man is easily considered weak if he speaks about his problems.”
“Frendit is one of the series presenting long-term survival mechanisms.
The series highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
Through the phone, I can offer help from the outside as a moment of disappointment, but long-term support is obtained from the close surroundings of friends and family.”
Comedy Central's FriendsFest in honor of the series of scenes has been awakened. So if you are taking part in the event this weekend, it's worth bringing your friends to a coffee in Central Perks.
Or do something even better. smile and greet if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship relationship can be triggered from it.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG break down Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan as a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in scoring in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and assessment.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain started their work in the Champions League by hit at the Parc des Princes stadium in Malmö on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the goal when the debut game was played less than four minutes. He confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in the match. However, the PSG scored a number of scores before they eventually were able to increase their leadership: Cavani scored when the game was played for 60 minutes.
In the A group are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. the PSG not only seeks a further place in the drop games, but it also wants to improve its position for the quarterman in the remaining three matches.
Although SPG scored points, the match was not the perfect show of the team led by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal representation and the man was replaced when the opponent was his former home career, where the man began his great career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League at home or in guests, so 2-0 win and good drawings give us a good basis, even though we still have to be deceived for the season," Blanc said.
“This knows good.
We’ve got a win and we’ve been able to do it, but I’m sorry that we didn’t get one or two more goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after a wound. The team had to satisfy the 2–2 match in Ligue 1 against Bordeaux on the weekend. Di Maria, however, left Ibrahimovic his shadow for four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine player who moved from Manchester United to the PSG ranks was named PSG's sollector, which raises the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of nomination by thanking the ball for Marco Verratti's deposit over Malmö's defense and then scored a precise hit to the back of the goal over Johan Wiland.
However, those who were expecting the PSG win were disappointed.
Malmö crushed Celtic in the drop games, marched to the field with nine international players from the start. The team playing with the defense of five men and the tactics of two attacker was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdzic's shooting passed little over Kevin Trapp's goal from the back of the game in the 34th minute.
Instead, the PSG broke into an inutility and a weak finish, not at least Ibrahimovic, who lost five scores only in the first half.
In the aftermath of Ibrahimovic's defeat, Di Maria shot the turnover over Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second paint was created at the time of the crew thanks to Cavan. A six-playing Uruguay-like shooter shot a full-scale when Ibrahimovic eaten him from the throw of the left-handed attacker Maxwell.
Malmö's letter ended in another painting, and only Wiland's top-train David Luiz from the nearby to shoot to shoot had the numbers in the shore, and the painting of Ezequiel Lavezzi coming from the exchange bank was rejected at the final meters.
Malmö's co-founder Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG had its own class. "We played the previous Champions League game in December last year.
After that, we played only in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
Crossing is not enough.
Fighting for Parisians.
This was their top competition.”
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in shares
The Swiss mining company Glencore, which was tested by the falling raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion in its shares on Wednesday as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to reduce debt.
The company weighted with the crude in the price of raw materials as China's economic recession undermines demand and burns the market.
Glencore’s stock price dropped at the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share rose from 2.77 percent to 131.60 pounds in the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a 0.69 percent rise.
Glencore announced last week that it intends to raise $2.5 billion in shares as part of its strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 pounds, with a drop of 2.4 percent on Tuesday’s closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares, with a total value of up to 9.99 percent of the entire group.
The worries about the continued recession of the Chinese economy have led to the price of iron mill to collapse, while coal, copper and other goods have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House announced on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on September 25th. It is a counter-visit after President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing last November.
After the two-party talks between the heads of state, U.S. President and U.S. President's wife Michelle Obama will host a dinner to honor Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will allow to expand the cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides. at the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have the opportunity for constructive discussions on topics that will be controversial," the White House said in a statement.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February, and he is expected to be in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders. From Seattle, the president's trip will first continue to Washington and from there to New York for the United Nations General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to highlight a number of controversial topics, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber spy and the country’s increased actions in controversial waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon Reduces Diversity in Cinema
Matt Damon talked with African-American Effie Brown and said that diversity was not needed behind the camera.
A experienced actor in the HBO’s Project Greenlight series showed on Sunday afternoon suspended Brown, explaining how important it is to take into account the different views of the project’s chosen script for the dark-shaped protagonist.
“Multibility is taken into account in the film’s role, not in the program’s role,” Damon said.
Brown scratched and wounded by the claim. “Well, it’s clear,” the woman said after Damon’s comment on the film “Only in Mars.”
Damon and Brown had met with the brothers Ben Affleck and Farrelly to discuss the finalists.
"Whoever ever is a director, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character will be presented," Brown said at the beginning.
“The only dark figure is a prostitute who has sex with his white partner.”
Dear White People's producer supported Leo Angel and Kristen Brancaccio as the film's director. Damon replied boringly that the choice of the twin could lead to an unwanted result.
When the discussion was presented on television, social media exploded on Damon's angry comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger on the scene in a straight word: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks on the only dark-shaped person to explain what diversity is is so highlighting that it makes it pain."
The tweet was shared more than 5,000 times, and received 4,000 times.
Damon’s comments come to a time when equal representation of human races in the media is the primary issue.
After the teenager Michael Brown died from a white police creature in 2014. The Black Lives Matter movement received support across the country. The movement aims to stop the dark-and-discriminatory treatment by lawmakers and authorities.
In February, singer Prince referred to the release when presenting the nominations for the album of the year at the Grammy gallery.
“Albums are still important,” he said.
“As with books and the life of the dark, the albums still matter.”
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement published a statement in response to Fow News’ Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question of whether the group should be characterized as a hostile group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love,” the movement’s leadership said.
Damon is one of the entertainers, producers and media modules who are called to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether Damon responded positively to the invitation.
The first American Ninja Warrior winner
The professional basketball player and asset collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and quoted a million dollars for his win.
In the seventh season of the television series, for the first time, all the assigned tasks were cleared.
In the last episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the last round.
In the last task, the men had to hurt from the 23-metre corner up to the top in 30 seconds.
He was the first competitor to complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior Cup accepted. however, Caldiero achieved the mission three seconds faster and became the winner.
Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after attacking a million-dollar pot.
“The winning amount is incredible, because I’ve never earned more than $10,000 a year,” he said in an interview with E!
Suddenly, I can’t even imagine what’s going on, the future is completely open.”
The corresponding producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why the British won’t be awarded, although he was the first competitor to finish all the tasks.
According to the rules, the fastest wins the prizes.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest will win,” Weed explained.
“The money prize is wonderful and transforms life, but the British are also satisfied with their performance.
I don't think he's going to be buried more.
He is satisfied with his performance.
He has received a lot of praise from the fans.
The British is a great guy for whom the family is important.
His children and his wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that because he didn’t win himself, he preferred the victory to Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought the same about him if the situation had been different.”
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for the eighth season, with premiums starting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers to win on Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers have no pleasant experiences in the second half of the season.
The Tigers, one of the best teams in baseball, is now the last place in the American League Central.
The team, however, managed to hit Minnesota on Tuesday at the Twins Target Field.
Twins lost their chance to rise in the Houston Astros to feel fighting down games from another wild card site.
Detroit returned, even for only one night, to the taste of victory, which has been in the second half of the season behind the stone.
“Every victory is pleasant, no matter how it is achieved,” said the Tigers leader Brad Ausmus.
The Tigers feedman, Alfredo Simon, held his top when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two round, once in the sixth and once again in the ninth round.
Simon (13-9) spoke 6 1/3 of a good game and left three runs.
