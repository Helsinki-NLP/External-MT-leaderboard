Members of the Assembly (AMs) of Wales are worried about being seen as a nuisance
Some Assembly members have complained about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to a proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly on all sides of the political spectrum fear that this is a mockery.
One in the Department of Labor who is a Member of the Assembly says his group is concerned that this issue is consistent with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh twp means cake and pwp means cake.
A Plaid Assembly member said the whole group was happy and made suggestions.
A member of the Conservative party in Wales said his group was "open" to a name change, only saying it was just an abbreviation of a word from the MWP Animation Show.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced the same as the letter you pronounce in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now drafting a bill to change the name, said: "Clearly, the final decision on any words by which the Members will be called rests with the members themselves".
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gives members of the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced its decision after consulting the public on the proposal and found that the majority of people supported the idea of calling a meeting for the Welsh Parliament.
As to how the Assembly Members were to be called, the commission preferred to call them Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but the choice to call them MWPs received much public support.
It sounds like the Assembly members are proposing another name, but reaching agreement may require them to contact the Communications Director, Elin Jones, who is expected to take a formal photo of the name change in a few weeks.
The amended bill will include other changes to the way the meeting operates, including removing Assembly Members from office and the structure of committee management.
The members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to choose what they want to be called when the time comes to debate the bill.
Macedonians go to the polls over changing the country's name
On Sunday voters will vote on whether they want their country's name changed to the Republic of North Macedonia".
These general elections were held to settle a decades-long dispute over neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor appears as if it were its own territory and has repeatedly opposed its participation in EU and NATO membership elections.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the name change, said he would throw the election into the dustbin.
But voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say they should buy EU and NATO membership by changing the name.
St. Martin's Church's Trust Falls While Churches Are Getting Stronger in Harlem
"Historically", said Mr. Adams, "the adults I spoke to said that on every corner there was a church and a boys' school".
"Today there is none".
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
These days "people enjoy themselves in a variety of ways", he says.
"The bars are no longer the town's regular rest houses".
And in the case of the churches, he says he is concerned that the profits from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders hope, "and soon they will be back in business".
He also said that churches are being replaced by crowded apartment buildings to make room for empty places of worship.
He said: "Most of these apartments will be bought by whites and they will speed up the closing of these churches completely because it is unlikely that many of the people who live in those apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black community - in 1870 it was called Metropolitan Community, and ten years later it was called St. Martin's.
The first white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
Then a black congregation that had been attending church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's came under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a strike against people shopping on 125th Street, a major commercial street in Harlem, since the stores there refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's churchmen drew up plans to rebuild it, restoring the church's cast iron function.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called it "the poor man's trust".
The scholar who played the instrument in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "the most irreplaceable instrument in history".
That scholar, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, said that it was the world's first bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years earlier played the bell in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not find anyone else for him.
What happened in St. Martin a few months ago has been a riot between architects and contractors, some brought in by lower church leaders, while others were brought in by the Episcopal diocese.
The council - the governing body of the church, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July complaining that the diocese would demand that the costs go through the council, but the council was not included when hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some customers complained that there is no transparency in the dais.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy as he goes lobster hunting in California
Officials say a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark on Saturday in California while out fishing for lobsters on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy cry for help, and a group rushed the boy out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was the joy of catching a lobster, but he realized that it was a worm that said I'm one!
It is one!'
Hammel said that as soon as he reached the boy he noticed that his "chest was torn".
"I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a snake in the water!'" Hammel said.
The boy was rushed by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is said to be in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked him is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, a marine patrolman, told the media that the shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier and was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim has severe chest injuries
Officials have sealed off the beach to keep no one from Ponto Beach, Casablad to Swami's, Ecinitas for 48 hours for training and safety.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's designs enter UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams by creating beauty-shopping stores with specialist retailers.
As part of a major move to enter the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, a growing fashion and home appliance market, huge beauty shelves have been installed in 11 stores nationwide and if successful, will be added to the chain next summer.
This beauty investment reaches the point where department stores are looking for ways to use up the space on shelves that formerly housed TVs, microwaves, and appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw brands for the first time.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees brands will also be given more space in the listings of brands like those found in the Boots stores.
The supermarket also opened its own Boutique of make-up products so that most of the products would be free of animal-derived ingredients - something that many young customers want.
In addition, the perfume retailer, Fragrance Shop, will use additional shelves for its products in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open later this summer in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the new trend of buying snacks daily in local stores have prompted supermarkets to make a concerted effort to promote their products.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that small shops will eventually become like big stores as supermarkets try to compete with Aldi and Lidl's discount stores by offering more services and eliminating food sales.
Sainsbury's has added Argos mini-shops to hundreds of department stores and has also added several Habitats stores after buying those stores two years ago, which it says has raised the price of groceries and increased revenue.
Past efforts by supermarkets to revive the beauty and medical sector have been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's experimented with joining Boose in the early 2000's, but that partnership was dissolved when a dispute arose over how the store's pharmacy income was to be divided.
The new policy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds (£125 million), three years ago.
It says Lloyds will contribute to the project by adding luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's marketing manager, said: "We have changed the look of our beauty product shelves to improve the experience for our customers.
We also use individuals who are specially trained to be qualified to give counsel.
Our range of products is designed to meet all people's needs and the attractive appearance and proximity of our stores means that we are now a popular beauty shop that challenges the old shopping patterns".
Peter Jones 's complaint after Holly Willoughby withdrew from £11million business deal
Peter Jones, a favourite on Dragons Den, left after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from her £11m lifestyle branding deal to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household furniture and other Truly's furnishings.
The two's business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning posted on Instagram that he was stepping down.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den favourite, Peter Jones, in a rage as he withdrew from their successful brand deal at the last minute - to focus solely on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "burning" when the TV personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business deal - worth £1.5 million - was charging him with not having enough time to promote Truly furniture and other branded products.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop branding and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones took off in a jet from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
"Truly was the most important thing to Holly", said the source.
It was to be a long-term career that would last him decades.
His decision to withdraw left all concerned stunned.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday, the market was about to open.
The goods to be sold are packed in the warehouse at Marlow HQ".
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most popular investors, could cost the company millions of dollars because of the huge investment in various types of equipment such as mattresses, candles, clothing, and furniture, wood, which may delay the launch of the factory.
It can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby organized Truly and Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The families went on vacations together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night a source close to Jones said "We will not discuss his business dealings".
We have a strong "love of one another"
He drew the criticism he would receive from the press for saying what was considered "unpresidentially" and for having confidence in the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump sacrificed so much?
Trump spoke sarcastically as if he were reading the news.
"I have given up nothing".
He said Kim was interested in meeting him again after they met in Singapore in June where Trump hailed it as a major step toward the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
But talks to abolish nuclear weapons have been held up.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see "one-sidedness" on the U.S. side of the steps already taken by North Korea to disarm.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is pushing through sanctions designed to maintain the existing tension.
In his inaugural address Trump expressed a positive outlook.
He said: We have a good working relationship with North Korea.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Many lives could have been lost.
Now we work together well.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced good results - no more rocket tests, the release of prisoners of war, and the repatriation of the remaining American troops.
He recommended the unusual method he uses when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people crammed outside the stadium trying to force themselves into the crowded stadium! we have only about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the people in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Cause Damage on an Island, Hundreds Die
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was missing, it was not declared a national disaster, which is what international aid needs to provide.
Ms Sumbung said: "Unfortunately, in many cases it has been made clear that no international assistance is needed, so the situation is somewhat difficult to deal with".
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to Palu, it is not known whether foreign workers will be allowed to work in the disaster area.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations could be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Considering how Indonesia is repeatedly hit by earthquakes, the country remains unprepared to deal with this natural disaster in a dismal way.
Although shelters have been built for people to escape a tsunami in Aceh, such shelters are not available in some coastal areas.
The obvious fact that Palu has no tsunami warning system, despite warnings, may have contributed to the high death toll.
While the situation is normal, it is still not easy to move from one of Indonesia's many islands to another.
Now natural disasters make travel even more difficult.
The hospital ship that has been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo said that his main concern during his election campaign was to improve Indonesia's infrastructure and rough roads, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the budget is short in Mr. Joko's administration for the next election next summer.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from potential divisions caused by the unrest in Indonesia, where many Muslims cling to their old system of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using vicious knives, bows, and arrows, as well as other fearsome weapons.
Shebella: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool balancing the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat by Chelsea in the Premier League when he scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was bowled out by Xherdan Shaqiri when he was just under 30 metres from Chelsea's scores, at a time when his team would be beating them 1-0.
He stepped the ball with his left foot before throwing it into the stands.
The ball went up the box and into the right corner of the bars.
From there the ball came down and passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who had jumped and entered the net.
"I was trying to be in the spot, to get the ball and often games like Shaq are going as far as they can, so I tried to take as much time as I could", said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and step on it once, instead of thinking about shooting".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after Belgium's Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute of the match.
The Blue's scorer passed the ball by the heel to return it to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before turning in the middle of the field and running into the middle of the field towards Liverpool's scores.
Kovacic caught the ball and passed it just once to the midfielder.
He then kicked a nice ball that went through the opponent's goal and led Hazard into the box.
Hazard left the bench and hit the bars with his left foot where it passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday, in London.
Indonesia: Death toll from tsunami rises to 832
On Sunday morning the national disaster agency announced that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
The Society's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that many people were still trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings when the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on Friday caused waves about seven meters high.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was surrounded by the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man, suspected of killing woman stabbed
An investigation is underway after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with stab wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called on the local people to report the sighting.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: Investigations are still in the early stages but I appeal to anyone near John Street, Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have had their vehicle's front-facing cameras record the incident to contact us as they may have information that may be of use to our investigation.
A police cable confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found in the yard.
This afternoon friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as the police said, and they are about to inform the relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver who lives in Gryson Mews arrives and tries to enter his apartment but is told by the police that no one is allowed to leave or enter the building.
He was shocked to learn what had happened.
Residents are told that it will be hours before they are allowed back into the building.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman with a scalp came to the scene.
He keeps repeating the words This is the article.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the checkpoint and one outside.
A large number of police were standing inside the checkpoint, watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is requested to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Prevention without identifying themselves on 0800 555 111, and call 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue becomes the latest monument to be attacked in the debate over rewriting history
Removing it would be a fitting punishment for the Taliban-like damage he caused to many cultural and religious artifacts in England, destroyed by his zealous Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's supporters describe Mr. Crick's suggestion as "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: There was no way that in the present controversy over the removal of the statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would not be attacked.
The destruction of cultural and religious sites during the English civil war was not Cromwell's doing.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being punished for the actions of his grandfather Thomas, who lived centuries ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful commentary on Cromwell is testimony to the spirit of the 19th century and to the written history of a man many believe is still worthy of memory.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Many, especially in the 19th century than now, considered Cromwell a parliamentary defender against outside pressure during his reign.
Whether that is absolutely true or not is a matter of history that will continue to be debated.
What is clear is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century changed the course of our society, and Cromwell is considered one of the men on the other side of that divide.
What he has accomplished as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and remembered.
A Rabid Pig Runs to Death at a Chinese Farmer
According to news reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified as Yuan, was found dead with his heart artery blocked, in a blood pool near a pigsty in the Liupanshui market, Guihou province, South China.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in his pen on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly had gone with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, a cousin found him dead, and he found the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He says that inside the cage was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
According to the report, forensic examinations confirmed that the pig, weighing about 249 kilograms, was responsible for the farmer's death.
Her cousin, whose surname is Wu, was quoted in the Guiyang Evening New as saying: The cousin's legs were covered in blood and were bruised.
A security camera captured Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been isolated from further attack, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials reportedly continue to discuss condolences for his death.
Although not common, cases of pig infestations have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing some 300 pounds [295 kg] lurked a Welsh farmer in a tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs rarely come out in the wild but that tasting blood can make them attack.
"They like to play", he said.
They are like children, curious ... not intent on harming you.
Your job is simply to respect them.
The remnants of the Rosa stork bring heavy rain in the southwestern U.S.
Astrologers say that the Little Rose Moth loses its strength as it heads toward the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring tidal waves throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the days ahead.
Rosa had 85 mph winds, a Category 1 hurricane, as of 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located more than 400 miles [619 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a thick wind begins to blow from the Pacific Ocean and heads east toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches Baja on the California peninsula on Monday, as a tropical storm it will begin to push in tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring in 25.4 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Now the tropical moisture mix with the dense air will produce heavy rain in the southwest hemisphere in the coming days.
In this region, rainfall of two and a half to 10.16 centimeters [2.54 to 10.16 inches] can cause dangerous floods, followed by waves and mudslides in the desert.
Tropical high humidity causes rainfall of about two to three inches [5.08 to 7.62 cm] an hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
About three to six inches [5.08 to 10.16 cm] of rain are expected in the Southwest, especially in Arizona.
Floods can occur in the wake of severe weather events caused by tropical rainfall.
It would be unwise to go to the desert on foot, since it may not rain in the tropics.
Heavy rain can turn mud into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms can bring storms and dust.
The approaching heavy winds will bring heavy rains to coastal areas of Southern California.
A few inches of rain may cause a few swells and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in this region during the rainy season.
Tropical rain showers will be in Arizona Sunday evening through Monday morning, before finally pouring over the entire state Monday through Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain will sweep the Four Corners Tuesday through Wednesday.
It will be freezing in October in the U.S. when the Arctic is cold, but in the tropics it will remain warm.
Sometimes this results in dramatic temperature changes after short periods.
There is a good example of the dramatic difference in the U.S. midwest on Sunday.
A temperature difference of about 20 degrees is present between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the warm summer breeze will begin to return.
Most of the central and eastern regions are expected to warm in October and to cover the 80s from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
On Tuesday New York City may be as warm as 80 degrees, about 10 degrees above normal.
Forecasters indicate that there is a high probability that temperatures will be above normal in the eastern U.S. by mid-October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations the testimony given Thursday in the heated trial of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of molesting her in the 1980's, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, while the political side was still hotly debated, the regular Friday program was interrupted at the last minute to make this announcement: an agreement had been made by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he knew full well beyond a doubt that Kavanaugh had attacked him with a lion and tried to strip him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, with all sentiment, testifies that he knows perfectly well that that did not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that some 20.4 million people had watched the trial.
The company was counting the total viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The figures were not available in full for other stations that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also often has trouble counting the viewers in the offices.
To put that in perspective, it is the same as watching a football game or an Academy Awards ceremony.
Nielsen said Fox News Channel, whose program directors strongly support Kavanaugh's election, had the highest viewership of any station, with 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's trial.
ABC was next with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
After the trial, people are already very interested.
Flake was the main character on Friday's episode.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement in support of Kavanaugh's nomination, he appeared on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning surrounded by a mob of protesters as he tried to climb an elevator to the hearing before the Judiciary Committee.
He stood up and stared downward for a few minutes as he was caught on camera by CNN.
One woman said: "Here I am, standing before you".
"Do you think he is telling the country the truth?
She was told, "you had power at a time when most women had no power".
Flake said his office had made a statement and before the elevator could be heard that he would speak more to the committee.
The media covered the case for hours, until later when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to support Kavanaugh's canonization.
But Flake said he would do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the saint next week, as several Democrats have been advocating.
Flake was somewhat convinced when he spoke to his Democrat friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's vote was strong because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh before the election.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May calls critics 'politically insane' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May said in an interview with the Sunday Times that critics of her plan to leave the European Union are being too political about Britain's future and undermining the country's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018, for the Conservative Party Conference.
In another close interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched an attack on the so-called Prime Minister's Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect taxes on each other was "really a travesty".
Wayde Sims dies of gunshot wound: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on a charge of manslaughter, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of the altercation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, a CBS report working with WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he had admitted to shooting Wayde to death.
His bond is valued at $350,000, according to the Attorney General's report.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and the bullet went to the neck.
The department commended the Louisiana State Police's special search team, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and local residents for helping with the thorough investigation and arrest of the suspect.
LSU team captain Joe Alleva thanked the local police "for doing their job thoroughly and ensuring that justice was done".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a LSU basketball player.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "saddened and "terrified" by Wayde's death.
"This is something you worry about all the time", says Wade.
A volcano erupts coal in Mexico City
When the Popocatepetl volcano erupts, its coal reaches the southern outskirts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican residents to stay away from the volcano after the low-level eruption and reported 183 gas and ash leaks in 24 hours.
The agency had been monitoring the roar and the tremors elsewhere.
Photos on social media show a thin layer of charcoal smeared on car windows in suburbs of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017, geologists have noted an increased possibility of a volcanic eruption located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
Since 1994, a volcanic eruption called "Don Goyo" has been a constant threat.
Police clash with Catalan independence supporters before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters mixed with riot police, and as thousands joined protests marking the first anniversary of the vote for Catalonia's complete ethnic secession from Spain.
A group of masked independence activists were stopped by riot police, who threw eggs at the police and sprayed them with purple paint, which was covered in a black cloud of dust on the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
Later that day, more disturbances broke out when police used police-marshals to stop the fighting.
For hours, the independence supporters shouted "We will never forget, we will never forgive", and the trade union activists heard them shout, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the search, according to a local newspaper report.
In the region where people demand independence from us tensions have been high following the October 1 elections that the Spanish government has declared illegal but favored by Catalan independence supporters.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, although the turnout was lower than that of those opposed to Catalonia's secession, most of whom opposed the election.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last summer after police tried to disrupt elections at polling stations in the region where violent riots broke out.
Independence groups had sat outside on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The protest continued but they were forced to change tactics.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the independence protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would ever gain independence.
"Last summer was the most wonderful time of our lives.
I watched my parents cry tears of joy when they could vote but now we are standing with a man in a mat", she says.
Although the pro-independence parties of Catalonia managed to win a decisive narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, they have struggled to keep the people in the same mood this summer, as most of their leaders have fled or are in prison awaiting trial for their role in organising the elections and have since declared independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest in support of the police on her phone, said the confusion was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting worse", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison awaiting trial, announced that he would be a candidate in the European Parliament elections next summer.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to show my opposition to the democratic policies and oppression we have seen in the Spanish government", he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car burned down house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly set fire to a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 BST.
Meteorologist Bob Blemmings said that it damaged the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot at some point.
Livingston beat Rangers 1-0 on the penalty shoot-out
Dolly Menga scored her first point that helped Livingston win the game
Livingston's recent promotion stunned Rangers as Steven Gerrard lost his second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox coach.
Dolly Menga's goal was the difference between the two teams as Gary Holt's team tied for second place with Hibernian.
This season Gerrard's side have yet to win a Premiership away from home and next Sunday they face the leaders at Hearts, leaving them with eight points.
Prior to that, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna at the European Championships on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, confirmed that they are undefeated in six games this season, and coach Holt is undefeated since taking over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston left a gaping hole in the air for its flying visitors
Holt's team had to prepare long before they hit the point, with their holes causing Rangers endless problems.
Scott Robinson had a chance but played for a chance when his ball passed the goalposts, and Alan Lithgow's ball went off after finishing trying to catch a header shot by Craig Halkett that passed the goalposts.
The local team were content to have the Rangers play before them knowing that they could cause trouble for the visitors if the ball was put down.
And that is how an important point was made.
Rangers scored a free-kick and Livingston found the hole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to put Menga in a good position to take the ball, and hit it into the net from the circle of the field.
At the time, the Rangers had the ball long but found the back wall of the home team hardly hurt and at all the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned,
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to block the ball.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers' Allan McGregor and Lithgow threw a long-range shot on the other occasion when Livingston had received a set kick.
The Rangers kept throwing the balls into Livingston's box and kept holding them, while the catcher refused two penalty requests - one after Halkett hit Glenn Middleton off the bench, and the other to catch the ball with his hand.
Livingston's A funny thing to say - when we were driving
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland and Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston has done a fine job with good decisions.
They were brilliant, continuing to excel beyond expectation despite the promotion.
Not much has changed in their game and staff since they returned to the big leagues, but we congratulate Holt on the way he has made the team fast since his arrival.
It has a great number of cedar trees.
Captain Halkett is good, cleverly arranging the back wall, while Menga was not giving Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a break throughout the game.
The Rangers were not at all alarmed.
Although they sometimes even came under Gerrard's authority, they lacked those qualities.
Their goal-scoring ball was weak - they only broke through the back wall once - and that is what Rangers must stand for, being in the middle.
Erdogan received in different ways in Cologne
The sun was shining and the sky blue on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's dramatic visit to Germany - intended to reestablish ties between NATO allies.
They disagree on certain issues involving human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police said that for security reasons they prevented a large crowd of 25,000 from gathering at the mosque, but a crowd of supporters came out to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan activists - mostly Kurds - also expressed their views, spitting on Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to recognize him.
The two-sided protest shows the bravery of a visitor hailed as a hero by German Turks and a tyrant by others.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle rider killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford road, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the emergency medical services arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes months after a cyclist died after being hit by a runaway in Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
City police said officials were struggling to identify the man and to notify his next of kin.
Roads are blocked and buses are diverted to other routes in the area and drivers are being urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six constables wounded in riot
Six constables have been injured in a riot at a maximum-security men's prison, says the Prison Service.
A riot broke out at HMP's Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
"Tornado" special constables were called in to control the riot, which involved eight prisoners and was blocked on one side.
The constables were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Services spokesman said: "Specialised prison staff have been dispatched to deal with the ongoing situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers were treated for seizures.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are not surprised to hear that those responsible will be sent to the police and will spend a long time in jail".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the warden of the prison was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot police were called to the prison to control a violent brawl in which workers were attacked with snukha balls.
The Rosa Hurricane Strikes Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Floods of Ten (Drought Seasons May Be Happy)
Rarely does a minor hurricane hit Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa will release its remaining force into the Desert Southwest, potentially resulting in the dangers of tidal waves.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for Arizona west into southern and eastern Nevada, southern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday night in the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only ten tropical cyclones have had storm force or no storm surge within 200 miles [200 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with a speed of 40 miles [64 km] in the AZ valley".
Recent forecasts from the National Hurricane Center forecast 5 to 10 inches of rain, with about 15 inches of rain here and there on the Big Rim of Arizona.
In some areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin they are likely to reach 2 to 5 centimeters, and here and there there there is a possibility of up to 10.
The rose will be a blessing rain in drought-stricken areas, not in those at risk of flash floods.
Although floods do not completely erode the crops, some rainfall can be very helpful as the Southwest is now plagued by drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a severe, second-to-last-level drought", according to a weather.com report.
First, the Rosa Storm will bring rains throughout the Baja California desert of Mexico.
Rosa, still a super typhoon Sunday morning, will reach a storm strength of 137 kilometers an hour, 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and then head north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm will join the cool Pacific waters and its strength will diminish.
So it is expected to hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm by Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall throughout the regions of Mexico can be extreme, creating the risk of major floods.
"From 7 to 15 centimeters of rain can be expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with possible rainfall of up to 25 centimeters", reports weather.com.
Rosa will now move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona coast early Tuesday as a moderate storm, then moving through Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat to Rosa or its remnants is torrential rains in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S.A. Desert Southwest", observes the National Spotted Fox Institute.
These rains are expected to produce deadly mudslides and landslides, and rockfalls in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he is said to be in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, says Police.
The police are calling on anyone who may have videotaped the incident on a cell phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'was mocked by the Democratic Party's malice, rage'
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the core and radical policies of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a party rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that since Kavanaugh's appointment he has been "reproached for the malice, the rage" of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the yellow and heartless accusation that he sexually abused Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified to his accusations in the case.
On Saturday the President said that day "the American people saw the wisdom and character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to honor one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a distinguished record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made a casual reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican majorities in the midterm elections.
"There are only five weeks left before one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not just a candidate, but a real candidate", Trump said.
"That is why you have come all over the country to fight for the best candidates".
Trump claims that the Democrats' intent is "to oppose and obstruct".
A primary vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate on Friday, a senior GOP vice-president told CNN.
Hundreds die in earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia, the number rises
At least 384 people died, many washed up as huge waves washed up on the coast, as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when a six-meter-high wave hit the sand at sunset, killing many and washing away everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were doing their own thing on the coast and did not immediately flee and become victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster prevention agency, told Jakarta briefly.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it washed away cars, hoods, houses, hit everything on dry land", says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the ocean at 800 kilometers per hour (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
He says that some people fled the tsunami by chopping down trees and saving themselves.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu camps.
Aerial photos taken by the disaster department show that many buildings and shops were damaged, bridges were twisted and collapsed, and a mosque was flooded.
By Saturday, the coastal city was in crisis.
Several earthquakes were felt in areas with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Institute for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by Friday's earthquake was about 200 times as strong as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location, it said, at the end of a long, narrow gorge, would have made the tsunami worse.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" as he said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding to 540 injured and 29 missing, he said.
Nugroho said there could be more casualties and damage along the 300-kilometer-long coast north of Palu, located in a region called Donggala, near the epicenter.
The Donggala talks "were completely disrupted and we don't know any details", says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living here", said the Red Cross, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the disaster areas.
"This is already a disaster in itself", he says, "but the situation could get worse".
The organization was largely silenced on Saturday by not informing the public that a tsunami had struck Palu, although government officials say the waves had not reached the time the warning was issued.
A video that was posted to the media shows a man on the top floor of a building shouting loudly to warn people on the street below of the coming tsunami.
A few minutes later a wave of water broke up on the coast, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that cut off communication in Palu and made it difficult for many to organize rescue operations.
The military has begun sending relief supplies by air from Jakarta and other cities, say many, but the rescued need food and other basic necessities urgently.
The city's airport has reopened for relief purposes only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the Palu refugee camps on Saturday.
Indonesia Tsunami Kills More than 800
Truly Sad News.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived safely in the town of Palu, where workers had hidden in tents set up by their office, they passed through a disaster on the way, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he says.
The news is truly sad.
Even as relief teams began to prepare to provide relief, they complained that skilled relief workers from abroad were being prevented from entering Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, relief, aid, and supplies from other countries may begin to enter the disaster area if the area is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", says Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'This is truly a national disaster,' we can turn to international aid but the situation is not there yet".
As the second twilight in Palu comes after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of the missing are hopeful that their loved ones will miraculously emerge from the disaster alive.
On Saturday, a little boy is found in a ditch.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national paraglider coach, had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those staying at the Roa Roa Hotel are Mr. Mandagi and his students.
"As a paragliding master, I too am under a lot of stress", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that hours after the news broke that the Roa Roa Hotel had fallen to paragliders and fans, he sent WhatsApp messages in panic to Palu players, who were partying on the beach.
But his messages were unread, with only one horn accompanying the young, not two blue horns.
"I don't think the messages went through", he says.
Thieves take $26,750 from an ATM in Newport, Levee
On Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was depositing at an ATM in Newport, Levee, according to a news report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was withdrawing money from the ATM at the entertainment center and preparing to transfer another amount, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in this report.
While he was busy, a man "came running after Brink's work and stole the bag of money brought in.
Eyewitnesses saw a group of suspects flee the scene, according to the report, but the police did not say how many were involved in the action.
Anyone who may have information on how to identify the suspects should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, it wrote: "The person officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
The program's creator says he is replacing singer Ariana Grande on the show who quit "for emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current name, West once said that this word is central to his faith.
"I believe 'this' is the word that appears most often in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'he,' or wena", West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with the host of the radio program Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are.
I went from Kanye, meaning one, to Ye - just showing our goodness, our badness, our frustrations, everything.
This album is a mirror of who we are".
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs is variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this summer he has announced whether he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's bandmate, JAY-Z, also says that it doesn't matter whether the root or capital letters are added or not.
MEXICO'S AMLO vows never again to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly sworn-in president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed that the military will never again be used against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the massacre of students.
On Saturday Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "military will never be used to silence the Mexican people".
The military opened fire on a peaceful protest in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people as student movements for social equality spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support Mexican youth by providing monthly financial aid to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have led to gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding of A.I.
With China's focus on artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research, says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These comments come after various U.S. government departments made announcements about AI, since even the U.S. does not have a firm AI strategy.
On the one hand, China announced its strategy last summer: it aims to become No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget would be a good start, since the U.S.A. has far outpaced all other countries, and we are almost behind, and we expect to discover the next thing in AI", says Lee.
Lee told CNBC this week that paying double the cost could increase Al's chances of achieving big success in the U.S.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published last month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has investments in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980's he worked on the AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, invented American Othello, and later became the director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised the success of the U.S. government in contests such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, so that he could give some hints.
Lee said U.S. researchers should work hard to get government grants.
Lee said that China is not taking in experts; it is companies.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired university graduates in recent years to work for Al.
Lee said immigration policies could also help bolster U.S. efforts to
He said that he thought people with Al's PhD should be given green cards.
The Chinese National Council issued the Plan for the Next Program for Artificial Intelligence Development in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies support U.S. researchers, but the quality of education is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this summer the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence center, designed to connect staff and students, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is now investing $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, months have passed without any action by the U.S. legislature seeking to create a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians will go to the polls on Sunday to decide whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which will resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has refused to sign up to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with its province called Macedonia, says that the name of its northern neighbor shows that it is denying its territory and refuses to join NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June to propose a new name, but opponents claim that changing the name would affect the culture of many Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the election and refused to support the campaign, raising doubts about the turnout, which would be at least 50 percent of the required vote.
The question on the ballot paper is: Do you also accept the idea of NATO and EU membership on the terms that Greece has set?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is in Macedonia's best interest to change it so that it can become a member of organizations such as the EU and NATO, since the country is one of the products of the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje, says: "I came here today to vote for the future of this country, to vote for young Macedonians so that they can live free under the protection of the European Union because that means we will all live in security".
Although not legally binding, several members of parliament have said that they will support the decision to settle the issue.
To change the name, two thirds of the members of parliament would have to vote in favor.
The national election committee said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
But turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of voters cast ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, from the city of Skopje, says: "I am going to vote for my children, since we live in Europe".
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev and his wife Zorica along with their son Dushko voted in a referendum on whether or not to change Macedonia's name, which would open the door for it to attend the NATO-European Union Strumica summit in Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a few seats in front of the parliament in Skopje, near the tents of the protestors.
"We agree with NATO and the EU", says Kavadarkov, "but we don't want to get into something we know, not just get into blackheads.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to welcome us from Macedonia, we can still move to other countries, such as China and Russia, and join the Euro-Asian community.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment.
After casting his vote, Zaev said: I believe that most people will agree with this because more than 80 percent of the population supports the EU and NATO.
He said that if the answer is  that would  prepare us for the future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Research Strategy Center said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote, a figure below the required threshold.
A poll conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of those polled plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would support the idea.
For that decision to stand, more than 50 percent of the electorate must be present.
Failure to do so would undermine the policy of the pro-Western government, which has been in power since May last year.
Shebella: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City breaks through Brighton's goalkeeping
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke into the goalkeeping for Brighton as Manchester City beat them 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like things were going smoothly when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper was handed the ball in the middle of the field and picked it up from there.
He was caught between three Brighton players, then crossed the field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through one of the many sieges of Brighton.
He turned left and hit Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero, who kicked it with his right foot to catch Brighton's Mathew Ryan.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero still has a leg problem.
We expected him to play 55 or 60 minutes.
But now look at what happened.
We're glad he caught the ball.
But it was Sterling who initially gave the Blues a chance in this Premier League competition.
That point came in the 29th minute.
Aguero found the ball surrounded by many Brighton players.
He threw a good ball to Leroy Sane from the left flank.
Sane grabbed it before he hit Sterling, who was on the other side of the score.
The Blue Birds hit the spot just before the flood began.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to take a chance on the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the competition, there is little reason to push things.
But since Scherzer does not like to lose, he wants to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but he will only play if the Rockies are still in contention, having defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game, NL West.
The Rockies managed to beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday, but they are still working to win the division title.
Even if we don't get anything when we finish playing, at least we'll be able to enjoy the breast here in Denver and the other team we'll be playing with will be playing at a very high level this summer.
Why wouldn't I want to enter the competition?
The Nationals will then name the starting players for Sunday's game, and it is reported that they may include Scherzer in the game.
Scherzer, who will be in the starting lineup for the 34th time, played brilliantly on Thursday and will feature again on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding his Supreme Court hero, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of Republican majorities in the midterm elections.
All that we have accomplished will be put to the test in November.
Only five weeks remain before the most important election.
This is not a simple matter, I'm not just running, but I'm running, running everywhere for the best candidates", Trump said.
Trump continued, You'll see these Democrats' lists, you're already seeing them now.
They are willing to seize power at any cost, proving to be wicked and cruel.
He doesn't care who he hurts to get into power, all he wants is power and authority, and we can't give them that.
He said the Democrats are in a campaign to fight interference.
He said, You saw that four days ago and said Democrats are angry and evil, cruel and untrue.
He spoke about the Senate Judiciary Committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which the audience was not happy about.
Do you remember his response?
Did you provide the documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, slow down  that was the worst sign  I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a one-party church.
Be patient when people express their feelings.
It was no surprise when the Momentums activists of my party elected me.
I am the last in a series of Labour candidates who have been told they are no longer welcome  simply because we expressed our views.
My fellow member of parliament, Joan Ryan, was similarly treated because of her firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was severely criticized for opposing Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policies, national security and Europe, but surprisingly, Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders on those points.
The notice that Nottingham East Labour would hold a meeting on Friday said, 'We want the meeting to be open and informal.'"
During the eight years I spent as a Labour MP, the GC meetings held on Friday evenings have always been like this.
Unfortunately, the current political climate is no longer one of promising people to treat them with "kindness and compassion" - if ever there was such a thing.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party is no longer tolerant of people with different views, and people's opinions are judged by what the party leadership says.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as he was a colleague with whom I was dealing in politics and he started to want me to change my mind about things I would never agree to on national security through the EU market.
Every time I speak in public  no matter what I say  there will be a wave of jokes on social media about me being removed, about political issues, about me not being a Labour Party member.
And I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am also luckier than some of my peers, because I am only interested in politics.
I admire the motives and determination of my peers who are constantly bullied by sexism or racial prejudice but who do not shrink back.
Another discouraging feature of politics these days is that ridicule of others is considered less of a problem.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour party should show patience.
The truth is, we are no longer a one-party church, we are now without a spirit of "untrust" and the criteria for appointment are getting stricter.
Over the past two years, I have been advised many times to lower my head, be quiet, and things will get better.
But that is not why I came into politics here.
Since joining the Labour party 32 years ago when I was a student at school, angered by the Thatcher government's neglect of my school so that buildings were falling down, I vowed to fight to improve public services to help those in need  whether as a councillor or a government minister.
I have not hidden my feelings about politics, even in the past elections.
No one in Nottingham East can say that he does not know exactly what my position is on politics and the issues on which I agree with the leadership.
All I can say to those who are supporting this on Friday is that as the country works towards Brexit it will make things harder for families, businesses and prevent people from accessing services, I don't understand that and I don't want to waste my time and energy supporting the Labour leader.
But in reality my message is not directed at Nottingham Momentum, but to the people of my constituency, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that nothing will stop me from doing what I believe is in your best interests, whether it be threats of removal or political pressure.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr uncreated and sinking
The final two tries changed the outcome instantly, but Ayr was bound to win this exciting match for Tennent's Premiership that day.
This undefeated team of ten leads the race.
Finally, thanks to the strong back wall, as well as their good use of their chances, which lifted the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be happy.
"So far our games have not been easy, and we are still undefeated, so my heart is clear", says the trainer.
"I'm very proud of Ayr", said Robyn Christie of Melrose, "they took advantage of their opportunities".
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but, Scottish player Rory Hughes was given a yellow card, was sent off for the Warriors game, led Melrose to take a majority and Jason Baggot caught an uncapped try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a pen, before going into the break, and then made a solo attempt to get Ary to go into the break 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, scored by Baggot, cut the gap by five points.
The game was stopped for a long time because Ruaridh Knott was badly injured, was taken off the bat, and since the resumption, Ayr opened a huge gap with a try from Stafford McDowall, which was scored by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card again, and Melrose again used the opportunity to score on a try by Bruce Colvine, under great pressure.
But the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for sliding Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-out, MacPherson scored a point behind Ayr's goal line.
Climo scored, as he did at the restart, after Kyle Rowe kicked a ball thrown up by David Armstrong and Gregor Henry, who played on the wing, scored a fifth try for the home team.
Still Game star seeks new green pastures in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran wants to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he was appointed as the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Both said that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning how he will live after playing Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The photographer declined to comment on the matter, although the Scottish Sun newspaper said that Kiernan wanted to join the lucrative Glasgow restaurant business.
'It's our ocean': landlocked Bolivia hopes the council will open a road to the Pacific
The sailors forgot the headquarters of the seawall in La Paz.
Government buildings fly blue flags.
The waterways from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are filled with the song: "This sea is rightfully ours.
It is our responsibility to bring it back".
Across the landlocked Bolivia, people still vividly remember the bloodshed that occurred when Chile invaded the coast in the 19th century - and they long to sail again into the Pacific Ocean.
For decades they have had that hope, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia is a strong nation, which says that power is unity and peace, and we certainly expect to win this case", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian ambassador.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will represent Bolivia when - after decades of sporadic negotiations - Chile must agree to negotiations to give Bolivia access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the beloved former president, who is fighting a dubious election campaign again next year - also has a delegation traveling to hear the court ruling on Monday.
"We are very close to bringing back the Pacific Ocean", he vowed in late August.
But some observers believe that the court may not rule in favor of Bolivia - and it will still be the same if it does.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands said that it had no authority to grant Chile land, and said it could not say what the outcome of any negotiations would be.
That the ICJ decision is made only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was not difficult, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The past four years have not supported Bolivia's arguments, but have only delayed matters.
"The present Bolivian government is interfering with access to the sea that they do not want", said Zárate.
He pointed out that Morale had destroyed any Chilean kindness by his harsh words.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will have to continue negotiations, but it will be even more difficult to hold negotiations after this.
Since 1962 no country has assigned its ambassador to another in these two.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, called the fact that the court was rushing to make a decision absurd.
He said Monday would give Bolivia "a rare opportunity to forge new ties with Chile" and to "end a 139-year-old dispute so that both countries can benefit".
Calzadilla argued that Morales - one of Latin America's most prominent citizens - was using the sea to promote political causes.
He added, "Bolivia will not give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean".
"The court's decision will give us the opportunity to see what we need to avoid what happened in the past".
North Korea says it will not stop developing nuclear weapons unless it trusts the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his country will not dismantle its nuclear arsenal if it does not trust the United States.
On Saturday Ri gave a speech to the United Nations General Assembly.
They urged the United States to fulfill the promises it made at the Singapore summit between the two non-aligned leaders.
He made the remarks as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was about to resume the talks that broke the nuclear arms barrier more than three months ago after those held with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that "it is a travesty that the unprecedented sanctions and the refusal of America to declare the Korean War over are the things that will make North Korea proud.
The U.S. government is concerned about accepting the declaration unless the North Korean Government (Pyongyang) takes drastic steps to eliminate nuclear weapons.
The two leaders, Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, want a second meeting.
But many do not believe that the North Korean Government is really serious about destroying the country's weapons, which the country may consider the only way to remain secure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the gray hats in your street shop
If you want to get more hats and completely block out the sun, you'll find them here.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne produced a series of giant hats for their SS19 collection that surprised audiences at the Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram is full of unusual summer hats, and these designers have displayed their amazing creations on the fashion runways.
A highlight for Valentino was a snow cap decorated with a small, curved band on the heads of the models.
Other scars of the skull included jewel-encrusted skullcaps, a fancy hat, and even a penaple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also said that the choice of mask was unusual - made just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One invention was a full-size scuba diving suit with a snorkel and boots, while another was a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you are keeping a lot of clothes that catch your eye - you are lucky.
Fashion fans say that soon we will see big hats in the stores.
The white hats will replace the 'La Bomba' hat, a very wide hat worn mainly by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The small label that promotes the tight hats so prevalent in the media has led to a new trend for models - beach-grass bags the size of models' swimsuits, uncovered on the shoulders.
Orange raffia bags, with raffia strips and covered above with a white leather handle, were the highlight of the Jacquemus Paris Fashion Week's La Riviera SS19 collection.
Fashion fan Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and sea bags in stores next summer - it may be hard to replace these fancy items with the effort of fashion designers.'
John Edward: To be a citizen of the world you have to know languages
Scottish private schools continue to excel, and this has continued in 2018 with some excellent test results, driven by individual and team achievement in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
These schools, which have over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best services to students and parents.
Private schools seek to prepare students for higher education, for careers of their own choosing, and even for their place as citizens of the world.
Just as an educational institution can design and implement its own curriculum, we continue to view the latest languages as popular and popular elective courses in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: "When you speak to a person in a language he understands, the information just goes to his head.
When you talk to someone in their language, it goes to their heart".
This is a vivid reminder that it is futile to rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
Starting with the test results from last year, we see that speaking is scored higher than other subjects in private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages got straight A's.
Data from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students scored extremely well in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French, and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also scored extremely well.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages, as that is an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
In the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere, the choice of languages as subjects is now considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and math).
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the reasons employers gave for not filling job vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
So a lot of language skills are needed to prepare young people for a bright future in the workplace.
Since many future job opportunities will require the use of languages, this skill will be essential in a world where people are moving abroad.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a good chance in the future of acquiring life-long skills, such as:
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries gives a person who knows several languages a better chance of success than others.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to start a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by 15 percent of adults.
That is why investing in language education now is vital for today's children.
Speaking several languages, especially those of developed countries, will equip children to have better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, schools teach different languages.
Many schools will focus on more advanced languages now, while others will teach languages considered more important in Britain in preparation for the summer of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preferences, there will always be language choices in private schools, where teachers are experts in those languages.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing an education that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter where they find themselves in the future.
Now it cannot be denied that for a country to have a bright future, languages are very important in the workplace where foreign languages are spoken, and that should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be viewed as "the art of communicating with foreigners".
Private schools are a step ahead in giving young Scots this choice, as opposed to excellence.
It must be done well.
John Edward director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
LeBron will make his first appearance against the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The time has come when fans have long been waiting to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton said James will play in the preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long you will play will still be decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James will be playing in a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
I don't need pre-season practice games at this point in my game to be ready for the controls
It's time for Trump's West Virginia artist, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins his election campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia
It is the first of five trips planned for next week, including visits to the friendly areas of Tennessee and Mississippi.
As for the confirmation vote still being put on hold to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are on the verge of losing Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia parade at night and how is it viewed?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's West Virginia painting online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump may make a speech at the Supreme Court this week during the Brett Kavanaugh trial, which has become tense amid rape allegations over the two-week suspension of the confirmation vote for an FBI investigation.
But the purpose of this series of actions is to help Republicans facing a major challenge in the November election to improve their standing
That's why this five-person campaign next week aims to "make a splash with volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many places as he can during busy election times, a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's show will likely bring back fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be covered by Pittsburgh news media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, the first time he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, who is running behind in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to try to help him in the election", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup Team USA showcases fighting strength to give hope in Sunday's singles draw
After three rounds in a row, Saturday's rounds may be just what the Ryder Cup needed
The rank and the score of the game does not rest with one team, but this is something that players know, especially in competitions of this kind.
Where then will they say the spark has gone?
They had a six-point lead and now four, so I think we're going with the same result, said Jordan Spieth as he entered his day trip.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead and twelve games to play.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel a lot of energy and a lot of motivation, not the kind of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasted of three points out of four
Spieth has been a danger from a ball-shaped bench to a flag and an example to others.
The cheers kept rising as he continued his pace, putting in a valuable ball to take the game to four points for all while he and Thomas were two points behind two games into the game.
His putt that saw them play at 15 and they cheered him on, is a statement that he believes the American team is not out of the tournament.
"You have to be firm, and watch your game", said Spieth.
That's what's left for these players now
18 holes to prove
The players with the most points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undeniable Ryder Cup record.
Both are unusual but desirable four out of four and cannot go wrong.
Moliwood were the only pair not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
That game, and the enthusiasm from viewers to fans, means that it will be a strong team on Sunday, and no player will be known to complete the European Championship at sunset with Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It would be good if it happened at the same time in different pits
But the European languages of creation are relatively fast
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson punched Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball winner, while playing with Alex Noren
Bogey and two of the nine front guns drove the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could not get out of
On Sunday, even if you don't have a helper, no one will help you out of your hole
Fourballs and the players themselves are fun to watch up close because of the way both teams work together, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can be changed in an instant.
Europe have played well as a team so far and have a good lead into the final day but this four-player stage has shown that Team USA has the strength to fight a battle that some, especially Stateside, still do not believe in.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead into the Ryder Cup final
Europe will take a good lead in the Ryder Cup final after a good four-ball game on Saturday and a fourth-place game with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
Both Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two victories against Tiger Woods who was shooting from behind to take their lead in the four-point Le Golf National
Europe's Thomas Bjorn team, still in the hunt for the trophy they had lost to Hazeltime two years earlier, had overwhelmed the American team that was failing in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
America was in the fourth game, they won two games, but they could not reduce the score
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 games to win the cup
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four points in a row when he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood after a good weekend game, are the second pair to win four points from the first four games in Ryder Cup history
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they joined up with Woods's teammate and trainer Bryson Dechambeau in a beautiful 5&4 win.
Woods, who missed two games on Saturday, was showing flashes here and there but lost 19 of 29 games to fourballs and the fourth and seventh games in a row
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning while playing fourballs, returned to play alongside Henrik Stenson in the four-man events and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 to finish first and third in the world.
Europe was not just a new adventure, but a thrilling one, in the cool sunshine of southwest Paris
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas placed second on Saturday.
They regained the 2&1 lead they had gained in the Spanish fight between John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point lead in the playoffs, although the Furyk team's champions need to play evenly to defend the cup
After both of them left for two days, even though they seem to be unable to burn out
North Korea says they will not abandon their weapons without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions undermine America's credibility and there is no way that country will abandon its nuclear weapons on its own under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual summer session of the General Assembly that North Korea took "important social measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, ending nuclear testing opportunities, and pledging not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology
However, we have not seen a response from America, he said.
Without trust in America there can be no trust in the security of our country and under these circumstances there is no way we can put our own weapons first.
Although Ri made similar arguments about Washington's decision to lay down its nuclear weapons in stages with North Korea to be rewarded for the steps it took, his speech was significant because it did not refuse to lay down its weapons themselves, as Pyongyang had often refused.
Ri spoke at a joint speech by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim vowed to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula while Trump reaffirmed North Korea's security assurance
North Korea has long demanded a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons
Washington has again been slow to lift heavy sanctions on North Korea
America stresses the point of first denuclearization and increasing pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal, and opposes declaration of cessation of hostilities, said Ri
The idea that coercion will bring us down is a dream for those who do not know us.
but the problem is that continuing to be punished only deepens our distrust of ourselves
Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had discussed earlier this week.
The minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: If it had been East Korea that was in talks to lay down nuclear weapons and not the US, the laying down of nuclear weapons would have been a complete failure
However, Ri's speech was very different from last year, where he told the U.N. General Assembly that a rocket attack on America could not be avoided after President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
This summer at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with a "sine-destroy", congratulated Kim for taking bold steps to lay down his weapons, but said more work still had to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea laid down its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying whether it would take two years, three years or months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must pay Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: The implementation of Security Council sanctions must proceed with no hesitation until we have a stable, verified nuclear-weapons status quo
The Security Council has been trying to lift sanctions on North Korea since 2006 when it tried to block the supply of funds for the purchase of missiles and other weapons
Pompeo met with Ri at the U.N. General Assembly and said he would then visit Pyongyang again next month to organize a second summit
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this summer, but his last trip did not go well
He left Pyongyang in July saying the big job was done, but within hours North Korea had him arrested for making criminal demands
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month that they would dismantle the missile and nuclear space if America also took the necessary steps.
He said Kim told him that the "measures to be taken" he wanted were the security guarantees Trump promised to implement while in Singapore as well as measures to restore good relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn by taking adequate rest
A new study at Harvard University this summer is getting all undergraduates to sleep more to break the habit of those who are already experienced in reading and drinking caffeinated beverages to read all night.
A teacher found that students at a prestigious university lacked knowledge of basic self-care
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and former employee of Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted the study, which he believes is the first of its kind in America
He was motivated to start the study after a speech by the impact that sleep deprivation can have on learning
Finally, a girl came to me and said, "Why is this what I'm being told about now, I'm in adult education this summer?"
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - that surprised me,  told The Telegraph
The course, presented to students for the first time this summer, explains to students the importance of good sleep in education and sports, as well as improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Chief Medical Officer, said the University decided to introduce the study after finding that students were sleep deprived during the week.
This hour-long course included a series of collaborative activities
On one side is a picture of a dorm room, where students press coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books that will teach them about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep can affect an actor's performance, and the importance of having a bedtime clock
In part, the voters conclude that lack of sleep can lead to heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A compass map, with interviews, then encourages the participants to reflect on their daily activities.
We know it will not change students' habits overnight
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the consequences of choosing to smoke, added Prof Czeisler
The practice of nighttime surfing is still alive, he said, stressing that the latest technology and increasing pressure on students mean insomnia will become more common
Making sure you get enough, quality sleep, must be the student's secret weapon to prevent stress, fatigue and mood swings, he said - and to prevent obesity, because lack of sleep makes the brain starve, makes it tired all the time
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course, after attending one of the courses last year during his first year at Harvard
He said the study opened his eyes and motivated him to create a course for all on campus
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all undergraduate students to come to the same course before they go to competitive institutions
Prof Czeisler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm to go to sleep, as well as to wake up, and be aware of the danger of blue light from electronic devices on the screen, which can cause you to lose your sleep rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Menga's point knocked Gerrard's men to the ground
Rangers found themselves in danger again when they were beaten in their game of jako when a point by Dolly Menga hit the net on Steven Gerrard's team that was locked in, losing 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox were looking for their first league title since last February when they beat St Johnstone 4-1, but Gary Holts gave Gerrard's side their second league title in 18 games as manager to leave the team eight points behind Hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers were out of the game, not looking to score.
Rangers dropped to sixth, Livingston moved up to third and Hibernian finished behind on points
And there may be more problems for the Rangers after defensive back Calum Spence had to be treated after he suffered a head injury, he was shot in the head.
Gerrard made eight goals in the team that beat Ayr to reach the quarter-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, had the Livi 11 take a point from Hearts last week and he's bound to be happy to follow the way his team played, pushing them all the time.
The Rangers could have been the best catchers, but Livingston took advantage of the opportunity to catch the ball well
They could have scored in the second minute of the game when Menga gave Scott Pittman the ball and put him ahead of Allan McGregor's scores but the midfielder threw away the big chance
Keaghan Jacobs sent a free kick that got captain Craig Halkett but the back-spinner and Alan Lithogow were the ones who threw it away from the back of the net.
The Rangers tried to defend themselves but they were not very hopeful on the enemy side
Alfredo Morelos admitted that he must have gotten a penalty fifteen minutes later when he and Steven Lawless collided but the referee called the game off despite Colombia's protest.
Rangers managed just two goals in the first half of the game but former Ibrox defender Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's headache and Ovie Ejaria's struggling.
Although Levi's 34th-minute goal came out of nowhere, no one can deny that they deserved it for their performance alone.
The Rangers again failed to defend Jacobs's pitch.
Scott Artfield did not budge when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who took his time before throwing Menga into the net.
Gerrard worked through the break when he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the turnover almost immediately turned the tide when the ball in the wing gave Morelos a run but Kelly came running out of the line to defend.
But Livingston made the tourists play the same game they loved, Lithgow and Halkett throwing long balls repeatedly
The Holts could have increased their lead in the final minutes but McGregor stopped to block Jacobs' ball before Lithgow hit it head-on and passed it off the scores from the corner.
Rangers outfielder Glenn Middleton had another chance to make a penalty shootout when he went for Jacobs but again Thompson didn't even look at him.
Calendar: The discoverer of the Geiger Counter
Now a page from the Sunday Morning calendar: October 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, COUNTING....the day the German scientist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born
Geiger invented and measured radioactivity, the invention that eventually led to the Geiger Counter.
This was pioneering in Science since then, the Geiger Counter also pioneering in pop music, as featured in the film Bells of Colorado, where scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are parodied
Husband What is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger Counter, used to check for radioactive materials, such as uranium.
If you put these ears in, you'll hear the atoms being ejected from the radiation in the radiation
Evans: Yes, they eat the floor!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday
But the publisher bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer drug may teach the immune system to recognize defective immune systems
A new cancer drug may teach the immune system to recognize defective immune systems and then kill
Treatment teaches the immune system to recognize defective immune systems as part of the treatment
A procedure involving the removal of immune cells from the patient, to be repaired in a laboratory
Now they'll be able to see the protein that comes from many fungi and be re-pinned
A trial drug shows promising symptoms in cancer patients
One woman who took a medicine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective immune systems, saw her uterine tumor disappear in over 18 months.
The technique involves removing antibodies from the patient, preparing them in a laboratory to identify which protein is found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-staining the antibodies.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: Our conclusion shows that we have a very promising treatment.
HER2 is responsible for the growth of many types of tumors, including the urethra, uterus, lung, and spleen, Professor explained.
The same technique of removing immune cells from the patient and teaching them to follow the cancer-positive immune system has worked to treat a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West joins a campaign to talk about Trump's values, wearing a MAGA hat, after appearing on SNL.
When things go wrong
Kanye West was interviewed on Saturday Night Live after a rousing performance of American values. President Donald Trump has said he will run in the 2020 election.
After singing a song that night, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great hat, he caused a stir among Democrats and then rallied his support for Trump.
I often talk to white people and they say: How do you like Trump, he has a hatred of color?
If I had a problem with racism, I would have left America a long time ago, a long time ago, I said.
SNL began the program by showing a sketch of Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh as he stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee under sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the lamb was not broadcast, a video of West's lewdness was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock intended to make fun of West by throwing it.
West also complained to the weavers that the stage was not comfortable because of his hat
They raped me behind the station.
They said, "Don't go out there wearing that hat".
They raped me!
"We're not going to sink", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "What do you want to sink into?" "He's going to throw his superman jacket away, because that means you can't do anything to me".
Try the love.
His speeches had the performers operate on him, at least twice and the crew of the show seemed humiliated, reports Variety, by one person shedding light, The entire studio was silent
West was brought in at the last minute when Ariana Grande, a former gangster Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when he sang I love it, dressed like Perrier Bottle
West responded to TPUSA leader Candace Turner on Twitter: To one of the militant: THANK YOU for standing up to the CULTURAN
But contestant Karen Hunter tweeted that West was expressing himself, and that's a very good thing.
But I choose not to pay anyone ((by buying their music or clothes or not supporting their art) who I think supports and speaks about political values that are dangerous to the people around me.
You have free will.
So do we, he added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, to be officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the stage name Snoop Lion and the stage name Prince, changed his name to Symbol and renamed himself the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington exposes the practices of insulting the representatives
Kit Harington is known for his sword-throwing when he played Jon Snow in the HBO animated series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has debunked the prevailing notion that a soldier must be a man, saying that roles make boys have to be violent to earn respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes something went wrong and also asked how to address the issue of gender oppression during these #MeToo days.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels compelled to talk about the subject.
I feel like I'm on fire right now, where did we go wrong on this issue of gender oppression? she said.
What have we been teaching men as they grow older, about the problems we see now?
Kit believes that TV is contributing to this rise in gender-dominated violence, this being caused by the actors on the show.
He continued: What does one come in with and learn?
What is being taught on television, and in the streets, that makes boys feel sidelined by this type of masculinity?
I think this is one of the most powerful questions of our time - how do we answer this?
Because obviously there's something wrong with boys
In the interview he said that he would not return to Game of Thrones, when the series ends next summer, saying he finished with the battlefields and horses
From November Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West and this is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The TV actor said he considered his reunion with his wife Rose the greatest thing he had ever experienced on Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife right here on this show, and in doing so you gave me my family, and my life from here on out", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who had caught the eye of Kit's actor Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning drama.
The two married in June 2018 in the courtyard of Leslie's home in Scotland
HIV/AIDS China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials said.
At least 40,000 cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are of sexually transmitted infections, which brings a change in the situation compared to the past.
HIV usually spreads faster in some parts of China because of infected blood.
But the number of people infected in this way had decreased and almost reached zero, health officials said at a meeting held in Yunnan province.
Each year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS infection in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious concern among LGBT groups.
Homosexual relations were legalized in China in 1997, but LGBT prejudice is widespread
Because of the changing customs, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Most of these infections are caused by inadequate sexual protection in these relationships
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide HIV medicines to everyone as part of the solution.
Maxine Waters argues that the work provided information to GOP senators, exposing dangerous lies and conspiracy
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday flatly denied accusations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat has spoken out confidently that the speeches are being blown up by pundits and extremist websites.
Writing on Twitter, Waters said: It's a lie, a green lie.
The information provided reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, posted by an anonymous Capitol Hill correspondent during the Senate hearing of the case of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault.
This information was provided after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that an IP address identifying the source of the person who sent the information pointed to Waters' office and removed information about Waters' employment.
Waters continued: "These statements are lies, outright lies".
"A coworker of mine - whose identity, personal information, and security were exposed because of these scams and rumors - would never divulge such information.
These baseless rumours are lies, outright lies".
Waters' speech was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote: The way she refuses shows anger.
"This shows that he has no heart to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
They are not harsh or hardheaded.
They should not question the motive of the accuser.
They need to be calm and quiet".
Fleischer was apparently comparing Waters' response to what Democrats have said about Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics said appeared to be very angry at Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, a Morepublican candidate seeking to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is a big story if it's true", he wrote on Twitter.
In his speech, Water said that his office had informed the appropriate authorities as well as the legal authorities of these lies.
He continued: "We will ensure that these instigators are exposed, and that they receive legal punishment for their destructive actions and putting anyone in my workforce at risk".
Johnny English Strikes Again's Friends - A silent film based on one by Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to view the importance of Brexit in any new film from a British perspective and seems appropriate to the revival of the Johnny English spoof comedy franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the ridiculous punishments of our stupidity be another opportunity for the nation's exports?
Despite the circumstances, Johnny English, a black-haired man, miraculously got his license renewed a second time - a name that suggests he makes fun of the appearance of things not intended for non-English-speaking movie buffs.
It is the sea monster who, despite his astonishing pretensions to fame, has taken on some of the roles of Clouseau, Mr Bean's little brother and the little brother of a peer who sang the same note in the Chariots of Fire song in London at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.
He also initially imitated the mysterious traveler and alien Atkinson who had previously been portrayed in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard, leaving problems in his wake.
There is one or two good things about JE dating recently.
I love Johnny English approaching the helicopter in his old uniform and its gasket touching his skull.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is shown, but the comic element sounds less comical and unnecessary, especially since the hardcore genre of films like 007 and Mission Impossible now faithfully portray comedy as a priority.
It seems that the comedy is for children and not adults, and in my opinion Johnny English's comic misadventures do not show the creativity and captivity of Atkinson's silent movies with Bean's character.
The torrential rains are proof that Great Britain is now in serious trouble.
The computer hacker has leaked Britain's top spy secret, naming all the British operatives, to the surprise of the operatives - unfortunately Kevin Eldon played a small role.
Consider the prime minister who considers herself a bowl of chocolates and a bully, yet becomes a political target: Emma Thompson does her best to imitate this kind Teresa-May but nothing can be written about her.
His advisers told him that since they had no more spies, he would have to bring in a retired man.
And this means the amazing Johnny English himself, who is now hired as a principal at a top school, but teaching without a record is a way to hide the glitter: great movies here as English promises the School of Rock academy of the future.
English is rushed back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets his former patient rival Bough, whose role is played by Ben Miller.
Now a married man, Bough is tied to a submarine captain, the role of a grumpy girl with whom Vicki Pepperdine is wasting time.
So Batman and Robin, who are used to making bad mistakes at Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in force, meeting the attractive Olga Kurylenko's Ophelia Bulletova.
When the prime minister is caught in the dangerous trap of a billionaire tech-savvy, who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: Jason Volta, the predictor of bad luck, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their dazzling odyssey of laughter, posing as janitors, lighting a fire in a French restaurant; they start a crime spree and sneak into the luxurious Volta ship; and English starts a riot when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get familiar with the interior of the Volta house.
All the breaks are anyway left for this last episode, but despite the social and chaotic nature, there is still something for kids on TV.
Truly, they are not the same.
After watching some of Johnny English's films I wondered: Does the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Trade unions oppose Britain's plan to pay workers five days' pay for four days' work
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to look at a major bill that would ensure that Britons work four days a week - but get paid five.
The movement reportedly wants company executives to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
That would give workers three days' weekend - but they would still be paid another day.
The sources say that the idea would be "in keeping" with the party's economic goals and plans to transform the country for the benefit of workers.
Going to work four days a week was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic reforms.
A prominent Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A change of policy is expected to be announced before the summer is out.
'This will not happen overnight but working four days a week is a desire consistent with the party's policy of balancing the national economy for the benefit of labor as well as the overall industrial policy of the party.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such a motion, as the Green Party committed during the 2017 general election campaign to a four-day workweek.
However, this desire is now not recognized by the Labour Party in general.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Working four days a week is not a party policy, and it is not a matter being discussed by the party.'
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour party conference to examine his views on socialist economic reform.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to strip the firms of 'uncharacteristic managers' and 'experts'.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also suggest that current shareholders in water companies may not get all their money back as the Labour government may 'withdraw the money' because of a suspected mistake.
He also approved plans to put workers on company boards and to create a Joint Stock Fund to put 10 percent of private firms' shares in the hands of workers, who could receive a summer dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether FBI investigations into Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week, raising questions about whether the court's findings could change the minds of any Republican members to not give support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI would produce anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was born to a coworker from South Carolina.
"I mean, I hear", Kennedy said.
"When I went to the trial, I said, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, to bring up the charge, and said, 'Did you do this?'
He was stiff-necked and gnashing his teeth, and he did not keep the lamb from the flock".
Graham's vote, however, proved to be unalterable.
"I have made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it will take a strong indictment to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied the yellow", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who speaks about him can prove it.
Thirty-six years have passed.
I see something new that can change".
What Is Global Citizen's Day, and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, a summer music festival that celebrates many real music stars and has a similarly exciting goal: to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy the music of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an outgrowth of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who take action to combat it.
To get a free ticket to the concert (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concertgoers had to perform certain tasks, or "steps", such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or doing anything else that would help to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal with 12 years to go?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert ticket a legitimate way to get people to demand action, or is it just another form of "clicktivism" - people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million moves by its supporters, with many different motives.
It says these measures have helped to motivate world leaders to declare their commitments and policies worth some $37 billion, which are intended to affect the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group approved 390 commitments and notifications resulting from the measures it took, at least $10 billion of which had already been approved or paid from the fund.
The group estimates that to date the funds received have directly affected the lives of some 649 million people worldwide.
Other key donors include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. alliance of investors committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging to help Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can end the social injustice caused by malnutrition", The Power of Nutrition spokeswoman Tracey Ullman told a crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 steps in the U.K. to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced a fund for a project, Nutrition Power, that will save 5 million women and children from malnutrition.
In response to one of the questions and answers on its website, it asks: "What makes you think we can end hunger in the developing world?"
Global citizen said: "It will be a long and steep journey - at times we will stumble and fall.
But like the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed, because power is unity.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this summer's New York festival, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to "clutter" Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary", the US government could use the Navy to block Russian energy from going to markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
While Russia has been involved in the Syrian war - where it has sent a military contingent by the ruling government - that is just a rush to find new energy markets, Zinke said.
He reportedly said: "I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy as they did in eastern Europe, in southern Europe".
And according to the official, there are ways to combat this.
He said: "The United States has the ability to use its Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary to block, to ensure that their energy does not go to markets.
Zinke was addressing a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as "the energy consumer advocate" of the US.
He went on to compare the U.S. government's approach to Russia and Iran, saying that they are basically the same success.
"For economic reasons Iran and Russia may choose to cut the valley and switch oil", he said, referring to Russia as "another dumb-ass" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is proposing to boost its exports of natural gas made in Europe, which would take out Russia, which sells steel to European customers.
As a result, officials in the Trump administration, and even U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "false" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, led Moscow to take over Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the purpose of which is to increase the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic kilometers, is merely a commercial project.
The Russian government insists that the U.S. Government's objection to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree on the fact that energy is not a tool of oppression and that consumers have the freedom to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US approach has been a monkey's back, as Germany has assured that it will continue to support the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to break with EU energy policy and agreements reached by the German and Russian Governments.
"I am very concerned when another country acts as a disruptor in our energy affairs", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Consider Seriously Running for President in 2020, Says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren made sure that he would consider resigning.
"It is time for women to take over Washington and fix our broken government, led by a woman", The Hill put it.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren unmasked President Donald Trump in the city hall, declaring that he was leaving the country.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is really doing to our democracy", he says.
Warren publicly denounced Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote on Twitter, "we need FBI investigations before we vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that most of the constituencies Warren voted in do not think he should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of those who were "likely" to vote in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run.
32 percent support his resignation.
The poll shows that most support former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for his candidacy, while 48 percent are against it.
Other prominent Democrats mentioned as potential 2020 candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at a rally for the Donald Trump party
Track Palin, 26, spent a summer in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What happens to my son, what happens to him after he returns, is similar to the effects of PTSD that other families experience and our soldiers come home emotionally hurt", he told the crowd at a rally of Donald Trump's party in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin says that her incarceration "is a problem that people don't want to talk about" and that her son and other veterans, "come back different, come back with a lot of courage, come back wondering if there is any respect for what other soldiers and the air force, and every member of the military, have given for their country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and carrying a drunk weapon, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
18 U.S. states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy of denying victims of gangs or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from 18 U.S. states and territories led a report on those affected by the policy on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her husband "and the sons of members of his gang", had abused her but U.S. government officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Government officials supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which have the highest number of asylum applications in the U.S., as those countries face endless problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented refugees fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "is in violation of state, federal [American] and international law".
"UN law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each application, and that prohibition breaches that principle", according to a report by the policy-affected body.
Moreover, the agency reported that a policy of not allowing refugees into the U.S.A. could slow the economy, saying that such people could start their own businesses or "carry out important jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered officials in charge of refugee affairs to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or violent crime in June.
"Asylum is available to those fleeing their home countries because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions put it as June 11 when announcing the policy.
Asylum was by no means meant to solve all problems -- even the deep problems that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts are underway in Palu as the death toll swells to search for survivors
The survivors were in trouble.
"We are nervous", said a 35-year-old mother named Risa Kusuma, as she gave birth to her son at a rescue center in the stricken city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, picking up their wet clothes, trying to save whatever they could.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals that were devastated by the 7.5-magnitude quake were overcrowded.
Other injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for the effects of the crashes.
With tears in his eyes, he recounted his feelings when a powerful earthquake shook the five-story hotel room where he, his wife, and daughter were staying.
"There was no time to run away.
I was trapped by the rubble of the collapsed walls", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had gone to a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but she was silent!
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' with 'false advertising'
A week after a major Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad about America that disparaged the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, an American diplomat accused the Chinese Government of using the American publication to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke to the regular China Daily newspaper in the Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on Dec. 6, an accusation China denies.
Trump's exposure of the Chinese government by interfering in US elections is consistent with what US government officials told Reuters is a new phase of the US government's accelerated crackdown on China.
While it is common for governments to promote trade, China and the United States are in a fierce competition in trade, with both countries increasing tariffs on imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs were intended to punish states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, say experts in China-U.S. relations.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said the Chinese government had hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, that China "is now putting salt in the soup by deliberately putting false advertisements on our free press".
Branstad wrote: "To spread this propaganda, the Chinese government has taken the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register".
"On the other hand", he says, "if you walk down this street in Beijing, you will find few who express dissatisfaction and you will not see the real attitude of the Chinese people to China's sinking economic situation, because the media is controlled with an iron rod by the Chinese Communist Party".
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had tried to publish his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans throw out women voters ahead of midterm elections in Kavanaugh Crisis, Analysts Warn
As prominent Republicans form a coalition to protect Congress nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple allegations of sexual harassment, observers warn that more women will feel the same, especially during the upcoming midterm elections.
This is a very sensitive issue, and most Republicans have shown that they are ready to vote.
These are not things to be ignored", said Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he did not believe that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) effort to crack the FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or even in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokeswoman for the MoveOn group, put it as Friday, according to a Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, activists shouted "The Wolf is coming!" as they protested in the Senate corridor while Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee voted to continue nominating Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic's report.
"The zeal and drive for democracy will be the ultimate", says Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political commentator, in the news.
"People say this is a very important subject; it is true.
It may be even more important, especially among the uncertain urban women voters and younger voters, ages 18-29, who, while not fond of the president, rarely vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of a corruption scandal against the Supreme Court nominee, the commentator says it would be self-defeating if the Republicans went on to assert that.
"This has been a frustrating turmoil for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not necessarily a matter of a committee vote or a final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets on the judging panel, it's a matter of how the Republicans treat the woman", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic election group, said in the news.
However, Americans seem to be divided on who to believe when Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony comes to light, with many supporting Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents actually support or perhaps agree with Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they do or perhaps agree with Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent thought as Ford did.
Following Flake's strong move, the FBI is now investigating the charges brought by Ford and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, according to a report in The Guardian.
Ford quickly testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that when he was 17 years old, Kavanaugh, who was drunk, molested him.
Ramirez laments that a Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party during their time at Yale in the 1980's.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet that will compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a program to try to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
This latest project by a technologist, called Inrupt, is a company building on the unrestricted Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid gives users the ability to choose where their information is stored and what information people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is "world domination".
"Now is the time to act", he said of the organization.
"It is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online database" or POD.
It may contain contact lenses, to-do lenses, a calendar, a music library, and other personal or professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify and is available when you search the Internet once and all appear at once.
A unique feature of a personal database is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who can access what information.
The company calls this "information empowerment".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the goal of Inrupt is for the company to develop the resources, practices and best practices to help make Solid available to everyone.
Now the company has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform bought by IBM, some contracted developers, and a team of volunteers who write the code for the computer codes.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create public-use apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not consulting "Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete revolution in which all their business models have a completely changed management.
"We do not ask their permission".
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "[Inrupt's] goal is to generate business and collaboration momentum to help protect the integrity and value of the new website based on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a major impact on the debate surrounding the fairness of Internet service providers.
Even though he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee would remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added: "I am looking forward to this coming era of what the Web will be like.
Bernard Vann: Victory Cross winner in World War I honored with a ceremony
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was honored at a ceremony in his town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won a medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later, completely unaware that he had won Britain's highest military award.
Two of his younger brothers unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, another of his grandchildren, a shaman, said that it was a "special occasion" to open the stone on the 100th anniversary of his uncle's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann led a thousand-man army or battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "despite the thick fog and the heavy smoke from the battlefield and the shelling".
Later he hurried to the battle line and with "amazing courage" led the line of attack with one man and struck down three of the enemy.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper in hiding on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his father-in-law's actions are "something I could never achieve but that makes me feel skinny".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also went to plant flowers after the procession, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be part of that march" and added that "the courage of a real warrior is shown by the support that the crowds will give".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but instead they were shown Peppa Pig
Imagine spending the whole night watching the crowded Bellator 206 and then being denied the opportunity to see the main event.
The series from San Jose featured 13 fights, six main card contests and was broadcast live all night long in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to cheer each other on, the UK hosts were left with a man in a diamond when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset that they had stayed up all night until the wee hours of the morning just to watch the fight.
One Twitter fan described changing the broadcast to include children's cartoons as "playing with fire".
"It's a state policy that at 6 a.m. the broadcast was not appropriate so they had to play a children's show", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked why the change of broadcast.
""Peppa the pig", really".
Bellator company president Scott Coker says they will work on their own arrangement to include UK citizens in the future.
"I think that when I think about repeating the play, I think maybe something can be done", Coker said.
"But it is now six o'clock on Sunday morning and we can do nothing until Sunday in our time, when it is Monday for them.
But we are still working on this matter.
To be honest, when the phone went off, there were a lot of e-mails and all of them were nasty.
We tried to fix the wounds, thinking it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government matter.
I want to promise you that this will not happen again in the future.
We will schedule five battles instead of six - as usual - we tried to fight for the lovers but we exaggerated.
We are sorry for what happened".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was self-confident because of his gender
This Olympic swimmer, Tom Daley, has been underestimated by others because of his gender - but that motivated him to want to succeed.
This 24-year-old youth says that he did not realize until high school that "not everyone is like me".
In her first appearance on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs as host Lauren Laverne, she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
She also said that being a parent made winning Olympic medals less of a priority.
The regular host of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, has been out of work for months because of illness.
Appearing as a rejectee on Laverne's first show, Daley said that she felt "inferior" to all people when she grew up because "it was not acceptable in society to like boys and girls".
"Even today", she says, "this feeling of inferiority, of being different, has been a real source of strength and determination for me to succeed".
She wanted to prove that she was "something else", so that she would not make a judgment call when her sexual inclination finally came out.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is a prominent LGBT rights activist and has used her presence at this summer's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to not discriminate against gays.
He said that he did so because he felt that he was blessed to live a free and honest life and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said dating a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "made me cringe".
Daley is married to an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her last summer, but she says age is no problem.
"When you go through a lot of hardships as a child" - she took part in her first Olympics at age 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she says it was hard to find someone her age who had gone through the same hardships.
The couple became parents in June, of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that his "way of looking at things" changed.
"If you had asked me last summer, the main thing was, 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he says.
"The truth is, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father could not accept that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be in line early.
"I couldn't say, Dad, you can't be in the front row", he said.
"When she stopped breathing I was holding her hand and it was only after she stopped breathing completely and died that I believed she was fine", he said.
The following summer Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had longed for all my life - to swim in front of my brother at the Olympic Games, I felt overjoyed", she says.
That prompted her first song of choice - Proud by Heather Small - which touched her as she prepared for the Olympics and kept her from getting any fever.

Hot-headed golfer Mickelson sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to show that he is hot again for the experience not to be bad.
Mickelson, who played in the tournament for the second summer in a row for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk in the fourballs and foursomes golf matches on Saturday.
Instead of winning, as has been the case in the United States, the five-time grand prize winner spends half the day as the grand prize winner and the other half improving his game in the hope of fixing the ones that don't cost him.
The 48-year-old never hit the ball with the drivers and even when he was at his best, he was not strong enough for the Le Golf National game of curling, where long balls often beat sliding balls.
And if the game itself isn't scary enough, in Mickelson's ninth game on Sunday, he faces the undefeated British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who is taking the new Tommy Fleetwood to the big game, to win all their games this week.
If the Americans, trailing by four points, start 12 games with a scoreless tie, Mickelson's play could prove to be a real asset.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, not that he was being greedy.
"He fully understands the role he plays today, he hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk says.
"He is very upset.
He is the most talented person in the game and has played a major role in these teams in the past, and this week.
I never saw him play two games.
I expected a lot, but that is how it turned out and we thought it should be.
He wants to prove himself, just like everyone else".
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may be his last game in the Ryder Cup, which is certainly not up to his record.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven games, but Furyk said his presence brought benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, likes to make jokes, and likes to make fun of people, and it's nice to have that quality in a group", he explained.
"I think the youngsters playing with him enjoy his presence, and in his bag, which I was glad to see.
His value is not limited to playing".
European stockbroker Thomas Bjorn knows that too much anticipation can disappear in an instant
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows the tragedy that befell him when he led them so far in the final day's games at the Ryder Cup that suddenly they were chasing him.
The Dane first came to prominence in 1997 at Valderrama, in a team captained by Seve Ballesteros where the five-point lead over the Americans was completely out of the question, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remind yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but things are just about changing", said Bjorn, pictured, after the 2018 Team won 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history reminds me and all in that group that it is not over.
Tomorrow we will go to the bathroom.
Let's go and do things right.
It is not over until you have gathered enough facts.
We have a goal, which is to try to win this cup, and that is what we yearn for.
I always say, I'm worried about our 12 players, but we know exactly who the team players are - the best players in the world".
Bjorn, impressed by the performance of his players in a hard-fought game of golf, added: "I don't want to add to the stew the raw meat.
We do not know what tomorrow will bring.
Tomorrow people will prove themselves, and that is something I do not know.
It is nice to work with someone when things are going well, but when you are alone, your skills as a golfer are now completely challenged.
That is a point you should remind the athletes, so that they can put in the most effort tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and you have to go and work hard with him".
Unlike Bjorn, center Jim Furyk would expect his players to be better off playing individually than with assistants, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three of four points.
Furyk himself saw both sides in the main tournaments of the final day, where he was part of the team that won Brookline before finally being defeated when Europe produced "The Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember everything he said", he said when asked how in 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw, who had roused the players to the final day, had done.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but don't start with a rush like you saw in Brookline, and like you saw in Medinah.
As the rate of the wave continues in the same direction, it pushes the games into the middle.
We have arranged the starting line up for tomorrow and we have put the boys in a position where we think we can do some kind of miracle tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the team to victory and faces Rory McIlroy in the title game, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other prominent European players.
"I chose this group in this order because I think that will cover all the situations", says Bjorn about the soloists he has chosen.
New German battleships re-launched
A new type of German naval vessel was to be ordered in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era battleships, but that won't happen until at least next summer due to inefficient engines and fluctuating costs, according to German media.
The signing of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", as the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, has now been postponed until the first six months of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was due to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery hampered this massive project.
The Navy ordered four of these Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships back in 2007 and they will replace the aging Bremen-class ships.
It is understood that they will have powerful cannons, numerous missiles to shoot down aircraft and ships, and some technology to hide the hull, such as a reduced mast, radiation and sound signals.
Other important features include the maintenance times - it will be possible to use new models of ships for up to two years away from the home port.
However, the continued delays mean that the latest battleships - supposedly designed to make Germany a powerful navy - will be outdated by the time they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 model of the ship suffered a disaster last summer and made headlines when the German Navy refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have reported "a number of software and hardware errors" that render the ship useless in battle.
Its software flaws are particularly significant, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-built ships will have a crew of about 120 - half the workforce of the Bremen shipyard.
Also, it turned out that the ship was too heavy to jump, which slowed its performance and hampered the Navy's ability to install future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to weigh twice as much as the similarly designed German battleships used in World War II.
Besides the design problems, the cost of the entire ship - including the training of the crew - was also a major issue.
It is said to have alarmed people by reaching €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - originally up to €2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new shipbuilding industry are becoming more serious because of recent warnings that the German navy is declining in power.
Earlier this summer, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary committee on security in Germany, admitted that the Navy was actually "running out of capable warships".
The official said that the matter had been going on for a long time, since the old ships were out of service and no new ships had been delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-style ships could fit into the Navy.
The National Trust learns about the private lives of the monkeys
A new study of a group of houses in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the frogs use the land to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results of the study will shed new light on the behaviour of these amazing animals as they fly and guide future conservation campaigns.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common soprano pipistrelle as well as the long-eared brown beetle and the Daubenton in four Inverness Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be installed at key locations on the site to monitor the activities of the frogs throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct online surveys using handheld scent machines.
A professional sound analysis of all recorders will detect how often the bats sing and what species they mimic.
There a map of their habitat and a report will be produced to produce a complete understanding of the behavior of the bats.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, is confident that the findings will reveal the habitat opportunities that are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This knowledge will help to identify the benefits of habitat management activities such as breeding and the best way to preserve forest areas for bats and other species.
In the last hundred years the number of bats has declined dramatically in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are threatened by buildings and construction projects that affect their nests and make them homeless.
Wind turbines and lights can also be dangerous, as can toxic adhesive papers and other chemicals applied to building materials, even being attacked by domestic cats.
In fact, the ants are not blind.
However, since they hunt at night, their ears are more effective than their eyes in helping them locate prey.
They use a sophisticated system of positioning to spot insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 historic parks, and 76,000 acres of land nationwide, takes the ants seriously.
It has trained specialists who regularly conduct research, inspect nests, and sometimes rescue bedbugs.
The society also organized the first single-clawed crayfish farm in Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
The manager of the farm, David Thompson, says that the land is ideal for the ants.
"Here in Threave we have plenty of room for ants", he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and beautiful living spaces.
But there is still much that is unknown about the frogs, so our task here and elsewhere will be to help us understand more about how they multiply".
He stresses the importance of checking the bedbugs before repairing a building because it is possible for someone to accidentally destroy one nest of bedbugs and kill 400 females and their young, possibly all of them.
The bats are protected and it is a crime to kill, abuse, or disturb them or to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to perform a resurrection of a man.
He said: "There is much to learn about the butterfly, and most of our animals are unknown".
Ronaldo dismisses rape rumors while agents plan to attack a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape rumors against him as "spoofs", saying that people "want to make a name for themselves" in his name.
His lawyers are prepared to write in the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus goalkeeper was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the matter, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers on an Instagram Live video hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "crap".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is nonsense", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to take glory for themselves in my name.
It is normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but that's life.
He's a happy man and things are going well", the actor said, smiling.
Ronaldo's agents are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they call "unacceptable reporting of complaints in private", according to Reuters.
Agent Christian Schertz said the actor will seek compensation for "the moral damage of the amount and extent of the interference in public affairs, which is perhaps one of the most egregious violations of black rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly took place in July 2009 in the rooms of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the groin, according to documents filed with the District Court of Clark City in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a good boy and only "one percent" a good one.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had sexual relations with the girl, but they were consensual.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police and had her wounds photographed in the hospital, but later they made a deal in private because she felt "scared of retaliation and afraid of being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to change the agreement as she continues to be frustrated by the incident she is accusing.
At the time of the alleged betrayal, Ronaldo was about to make his debut for Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he made his debut for Italy's top club Juventus on a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK 'will be in a bit of a pickle' as carmakers eat their way to the bottom
The UK "would be a financial wreck if it lost its leading position in post-Brexit car manufacturing, says Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He adds that it is "a matter of concern that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain were to withdraw from the EU without an agreement, that would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer says that a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars - produced about 150,000 cars last summer and 90% of them were sold in the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see production stop at our factory", says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will spend a month in the closure of its Mini plant in Oxford after Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what carmakers say are supply-side risks if no deal is reached for Britain's departure from the EU.
Toyota's production is based on demand at the time, and car parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU countries for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be blockages at the borders that the industry says could result in delays and a shortage of car parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to keep more than a solar stockpile at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Mr Clark says Prime Minister Theresa May's office's plan for relations with the EU has been "carefully considered to avoid border checks".
"We need to have a good agreement that will help us enjoy the present prosperity and to seize the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we should be able to continue what has been a great supply chain success".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but it warned that increased costs would reduce the factory's ability to compete and that people would lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union coordinator for Unite at the plant, says that their members are very concerned: "I have learned that once these jobs are over, they never come back.
"We have prepared a clear and reliable plan for future relations with the EU", said a government spokesman.
US Congress says Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed another week" as the battle over congressional nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the US Congress said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special agent Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been in the air for months in US congressional hearings in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed secret recordings of conversations with Trump and the possibility of being removed from the presidency by a constitutional amendment to replace the president.
Rosenstein disputed this account.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that on Thursday there would be a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations, in New York.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein and the meeting was postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to spend a week investigating Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about holding the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: If no date has been set, it may be held this week, or it may be postponed another week depending on other developments in the high court.
But we'll see, I like to keep the media informed.
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Communications director Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders says the lack of regularity of meetings is not because of a dislike of the "publicity" of TV reporters, though he added: "But I can't deny that they also like to be public".
He then explained that direct communication between Trump and the media would increase.
He said: The President holds more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him, and added without providing evidence: We have reviewed those figures.
Meetings will continue, Sanders says, but if the media has the opportunity to question the president of the United States directly, that would be better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do that often in the last few weeks and that's what's going to happen at the press conference when you interview the president of the United States.
Trump is always answering questions when he leaves the White House or when he holds public talks or has a meeting with visiting dignitaries.
It is not often that one person holds a press conference.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, by appearing at times and in surprising ways to gathered journalists.
A health secretary wrote to EU staff at NHS Scotland about the potential for Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working for the NHS in Scotland to tell them that the country is grateful and wishes them to remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent the letter even though less than six months remained before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to recover the costs of applications from EU citizens sent to work in government departments who want to be granted citizenship rights.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: In the summer months, the UK and EU continued discussions on the withdrawal, and a decision is expected to be made in the autumn months.
But the UK Government is preparing for the possibility that there may be no agreement.
I know this may be a difficult subject for you.
That is why I want to emphasize the fact that I greatly appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of his nationality.
Our colleagues from the EU and elsewhere, make a valuable contribution with their experience and skills to strengthen and improve the delivery of health services, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie Undergoes Emergency Surgery After a Head Injury
Mike Organ of Tennessee reports that Tennessee State Tigers running back Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury on Saturday while playing the Vanderbilt Commodores, who beat them 31-27.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the accident happened just before the break.
Reed said: He went off to the side to forget and fell there.
Practitioners and health workers gave Abercrombie oxygen right away to forget before taking him on a stretcher to check him out.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had returned from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that the nature and severity of the accident are not yet known and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore player, is in his first season playing for Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He had five shillings that Saturday before he left the arena, bringing his total to 18 shillings this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes when buying land in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes when they buy land in the UK and the money will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory system
This move will undermine Corbyn's success in winning new voters in the years ahead
Taxation will be raised for tax-exempt UK
The Treasury expects to bring in 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes when they buy land in the UK - and the money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's success in winning over young voters in the years ahead by promising affordable housing and overcharging those with higher incomes.
Tax revenues will be raised for individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money will give the Government the power to fight homelessness.
The surcharge - paid in addition to the current tax bill, including the higher rate introduced two years ago for second homes and rentals - may rise to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in £120 million a summer.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new homes being built in London are bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices considerably and complicates things for first-time home buyers.
Many affluent neighborhoods in the country - especially those in the cities - remain empty as many foreign customers spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to allow more young people to own their own homes.
He criticized large construction firms for causing high property prices, as they buy land but do not use it, and urged Mrs. May to abandon the affordable housing policy in order to fix the "Housing Shame" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has published a series of intriguing proposals for housing improvements, including a rent-a-housing system and a ban on landlords evicting unjust tenants.
He also wants to give government agencies more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: Last year I said that I would use my power as prime minister to restore the dream of the British people - to improve the lives of future generations.
And that means solving our housing problem.
Britain will remain open to people who want to live, work and live here.
But it would be wrong for people outside the UK and foreign companies to buy houses as easily as hardworking Britons.
Many people have no dream of ever having their own home, and the problem of homelessness is widespread.
Jack Ross: My greatest ambition is to oversee Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says that his "greatest ambition" is to be Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old native of Scotland has enjoyed the challenge of rebuilding the North-East club, now in third place in League One, three points clear of the top flight.
He moved to the Stadium of Light during the summer months after helping St Mirren to return to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country.
All I got was a B cap", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But as a child I often watched Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father and this always made me run away.
However, that opportunity would come only if I managed to run the club successfully.
The managers who preceded Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he is not afraid to enter the shoes of celebrities and big clubs, having rejected attempts by Barnsley and Ipswich Town to lure him in.
Now I will measure my success by Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
It should definitely be in the Premier League according to the organisation and management of this club", he said.
 It is not easy to put him in that position, but I will consider myself successful if I can put him in that position.
Ross has only been in management for three years, after spending time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months coaching Hearts staff.
He then helped Alloa to avoid relegation to the third tier, and in the following season helped St Mirren to avoid losing the Championship title.
Ross says he now feels more at ease than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
She recalls taking over the running of Alloa and says: "Maybe I was at a crossroads.
I firmly believed that the management job was better for me, not the game.
It sounds strange, since I was doing well, earning enough money, and achieving certain things.
But playing is hard.
There are many things to do each week.
I still have to deal with the problems and stresses of work, but I feel good about the administrative work.
I always wanted to be a manager and now that I am, I feel more satisfied than ever in my life.

Research shows that the best time to drink is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat has helped Britain's hard-working ovens but has caused problems for restaurants.
Statistics show that taverns had a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurants had a 4.8 percent loss.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "The continuing sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup run mean that July was similar to the previous June, when sales of wine products rose 2.8 percent, while restaurants took a bigger hit.
The 1.8 percent loss in restaurant sales in June was even worse in July.
The taverns performed much better than restaurants of similar caliber.
Food stalls also suffered during this heat, though not as much as restaurants.
It seemed that all people wanted to do was go out and drink.
Sales of legal grape products rose 6.6 percent a month, while food sales fell three percent.
Paul Newman, a tourism and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: These figures reflect the situation we have seen since late April.
Weather and the influence of social events or sports are what influence the sales of products in the markets where people are present.
It is no wonder that the restaurant business continues to struggle, although the 4.8 percent loss each year will be even more painful as prices rise.
The long hot summer has come at a bad time for food retailers and time will tell whether the moderate August heat will improve the situation as hoped.
Overall, cafes and restaurants, including new ones, had a 2.7 percent increase in July, indicating a decline in this business.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry monitors the UK pub and restaurant industry and collects and analyses data collected from 47 businesses, which have a turnover of over £9 billion, and this trend is estimated to be a sign of what is happening in the business.
1 in 5 children has a private social media account that they keep from their parents
A study shows that 1 in 5 children - some as young as 11 - have a private social media account that they keep from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in Fake Instagram accounts
This report has added to the fear that sexual information is being broadcast there.
20 percent of students say they have a Basic Account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 years of age - open a private social-media account that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a dramatic increase in fake Instagram accounts - where photos are posted on Instagram.
This report has added to the fear that sexual information is being broadcast there.
20 percent of the students say they have a clean Foundation account to show their parents, but they also have a secret one.
And one who hacked into her 13-year-old daughter's private account found out there was a channel that was pressuring others to want to be raped.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools, found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two accounts, and half of them say they have a private one.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: It is worrying that so many young people are being lured into opening online accounts where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "athletic advocate" for the Scottish Athletics board.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director of the governing body at the annual summer general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete in both athletics and other sports and chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for the sporting authorities to benefit from his international experience gained over the past decade.
"Ellidh is highly respected by all athletes in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from having him on board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: I am very much looking forward to becoming an athletic advocate and hope to contribute and help run the sport in Scotland.
The American winner of the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games as one of his four Olympic gold medals, now a regular on-air personality on the BBC, became paralyzed after a stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: Last month I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that time would tell whether and to what extent I would recover.
It was hard but I recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing speed skating!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
A milk pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows divides the public in the market
A company that makes breast pumps has created a controversy on the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to weaned cows.
The tech company Elvie released a comedy music video to show the freedom this new pump gives mothers who breastfeed their babies, while advertising what it calls the world's quietest wearable breast pump.
The four of them dance to a song with the following words in a cowshed full of fodder: YES, I'm going to get wet, but you can't see the tail and If you haven't noticed these aren't my cow's breasts.
Cyrus said: Pompa, pumppa, I feed the children, pumppa, pumppa I take care of the women.
However, the ad posted on Facebook by the company caused a rift on the Internet.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and hundreds of people have expressed their opinions on it, many saying that it alleviates the "problem" of the dairy industry.
One person wrote: It was a foolish decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they also become pregnant and give birth to milk, the only difference being that they are stolen after only a few days of having calves.
Elvie's breast pump fits neatly into the breast of the nursing mother (Elvie/Mother)
One person said: It is understandable that both mother and child are concerned.
But what is wrong with advertising a breast pump for mothers who are not separated from their babies?
Another added: This ad is meaningless.
Some have recommended the ad, and one woman even said that the song made her laugh.
"I think this is a good idea.
I would have bought it if I had not been breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm sticking to the message.
Another wrote, This is a good product.
Another said: This is a good advertisement for mothers who pump milk (usually at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
This ad is neither a compliment nor a condemnation of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they were dancing with pumps in their boots.
This view is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say that they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is silent, has no wires or bottles, and is invisible from the inside, giving women the freedom to carry their babies, and to stop and pump milk.
Ana Balarin, assistant and ECD at Mother, said: Elvie's pump is a highly advanced product that deserves special promotion.
By comparing milk pumps to milk cows, we want to highlight the issue of milk pumps and the problems that go along with them, while at the same time illustrating in a soothing way the wonderful freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two was featured wearing clothes made by Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Entered the Texas Valley Tent Camp
The number of foreign children in detention has increased despite the constant number of people living in the valley each month, and the reason for that is that the strict policies implemented by the Trump administration make it difficult to find donors for those children.
Usually, many donors are foreigners who are also illegal, and they fear risking deportation for helping the child.
The situation worsened in June, when the government announced that donors and other elderly family members would have to take fingerprints and that the information would be passed on to immigration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, chief executive of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who had applied for help for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later stated that of those arrested, 70 percent had no criminal record.
About 80 percent of the donors or their families have entered illegally, and the majority are fugitives from crime.
So we are still looking for those people", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the issue of children, authorities have implemented new laws requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, as was done in the past, according to refugee center officials.
Many will appear before the immigration judge on video, rather than go to the courtroom to file their case.
Those deemed unfit will be sent back to their homelands immediately.
The long time these children spend in detention may cause them anxiety or depression, which may lead to violence or attempts to escape, according to refugee center workers and prominent reports in recent months.
Proponents of the idea say the problems are even greater in large areas like Tornillo, where signs of a child's difficulty may be ignored because of the large space.
They add that moving children to tents in the cities without enough time to prepare emotionally or to care for their friends makes life even more difficult for many.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish troops to leave immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem again appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops entered Syria illegally, claiming to be fighting terrorism, and that they would be dealt with.
"Please let him go without further ado, " Paul said to the crowd.
Moualem stressed that the War on Terror is coming to an end in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this holy war until it had cleansed all the borders of Syria, eliminated terrorism and the illegal military intervention.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are there to train and advise the Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn part of the country.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions had improved for them to return, and he accused some western countries of spreading unnecessary fear that prevents refugees from returning home.
"We have asked international and humanitarian organizations to help them return home", he said.
They turn a humanitarian crisis into a political issue.
The United States and the European Union have said that they will not provide aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the rebels to end the war.
UN representatives say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to have a neutral zone in the last major rebel-held area of Idlib has opened the door to political negotiations.
That agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented the Russian-backed Syrian army from invading the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement was "on a specific date" and said he hoped that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be eliminated.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition representatives to draft Syria's post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem provided the conditions under which the Syrian government would join the committee, saying that the task of the delegation should be to examine the existing constitutional issues only and not to interfere in other matters.
Why Trump Will Win the Election Again
Thus, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020, unless perhaps many observers believe he will be removed from the presidency ahead of his time due to accusations of dishonesty and bribery.
That would undoubtedly be the most amazing end of a presidency!
So far there is no sign of the onlookers' getting tired.
Since 2014, the number of viewers of CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and that of MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the list with 3.5 million viewers on the evening newscasts.
"There is something that attracts people because there is something we don't understand", says Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which tells of a secretary of state who became president after an attack destroyed a state legislature.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedian and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", explains things in another way.
He recalls riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
Ms. Scovell said the driver said, Because you made me laugh.
There is humor in the midst of chaos.
True, unlike TV news, Washington news can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether or not immigrants will reunite with their families and the global economy.
Few observers with a sense of humor would choose not to watch.
And it's not just about being a good citizen if you find yourself spending six hours watching experts argue that Bob Woodward takes notes from his book called Fear but hides that he took them there, that Paul Manafort wears a $15,000 leather jacket (The Washington Post says it's a "dress of honor") and the consequences of Stormy Daniels calling Mr. Trump a hypocrite.
I personally will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "Pawn Stars", says of Trump's program that consistently features a variety of characters and events (he incites a war with the N.F.L., praises Kim Jong-un), One of the things he does that makes it seem real is that he gives you something every night.
If you miss that one session, you are lost.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's this week, the sun was shining and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was sitting in the house watching MSNBC while at the same time recording CNN.
He could not rise there, since Brett Kavanaugh was to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
Mr. Fleiss said to me: I remember when we were doing all those amazing shows and people said, That's when the decline of Western civilization began.
I thought they were joking, but I see now that they were telling the truth.

Money flows in large quantities in the bitter contest for midterm elections
It is no wonder that Pennsylvania's 17th district is so expensive, because of the merger of districts that has resulted in two candidates from one party in one district.
The recent merger comes as Pittsburg counties clash with Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb who won another state in a special election last year.
Lamb is running against fellow Democratic Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which has largely replaced the new 17th.
New maps were made after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been divided illegally and in favor of Republicans.
The election campaign in the new 17th district sparked a new campaign for funding between the party's main financial backers, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became very popular in Pennsylvania after coming out of the needle's mouth in the hotly contested March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th District.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have consistently commented that the Democrats are in a better position.
U.S. Considering Sanctions on El Salvador or Supporting China, and Withdrawing
Foreign diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama are welcoming Beijing and that Washington is still happy about that.
Mr. Trump held warm talks with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a Panama hotel until his colleagues fired the Trump Foundation executive team.
In a message earlier this month, Heather Nauert, a branch spokeswoman, said that officials of the U.S. State Department had decided to recall the American ambassadors in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama in response to the recent decision to cut ties with Taiwan.
But they considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador alone, which in 2017 the United States had provided an estimated $140 million ($140 million) in aid, including drug prevention, rehabilitation and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included a moratorium on financial aid and a ban on visas, would make it harder for the Central American country to cope with high unemployment and murder rates.
Meanwhile, officials in North and Central America held a high-level meeting designed to discuss security and economic prosperity after a similar meeting last year was seen as a sign of progress in efforts to curb immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted a meeting, thus putting a stop to the idea of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the summit, scheduled for mid-October, and the delegates say that shows that the administration values the summit.
Three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any messages of threat or sanctions from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's White House spokesman refused to provide details of the conversation that three U.S. officials spoke about, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the details of the conversation as long as they were not named.
Their reports have been verified by an outside auditor close to the management and he too does not want to be named.
Learning From the Past
Another potential cause for concern is the report by Robert Mueller's special counsel that Mr. Trump may have perverted justice, for which there is now ample evidence.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly again turning his attention to investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to rig our election.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to answer to that body, just as he is preparing to go back to the electorate, perhaps even to his colleagues.
There are many uncertainties, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump will fall or his European counterparts.
There are decisions that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make that will affect how long you stay.
By 1938, German officials were not ready to overthrow Hitler, provided the Western powers opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia, Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity that could have saved us many years of bloodshed that followed.
The wounds of history depend on such radical changes, and the improvement or decline of democracy results from them.
Americans are experiencing these dramatic changes in abundance right now.
What would happen if Mr. Trump fired Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was in charge of the outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein started getting into trouble after the newspaper reported that last year, he had proposed that the president be recorded secretly and that he thought he was unfit to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the Times report is false.
What if the FBI's requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or biased  or if he is allowed to stand before the Supreme Court despite being accused of sexual assault and there is evidence of dishonesty?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm congressional elections that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to do this, democracy will be in serious trouble.
But I hope that we will not fail, because of the things I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who had been sent to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had controlled my former colony.
He survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, he asked me to put Adventist candles on a table with a Nazi symbol.
Can I imagine a bleak future when I have such a wonderful treasure?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers hopes to win against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and know that winning the Austrian team, after a draw with Villarreal earlier in the month in Spain, will put them in a good position to qualify from Group G to the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans missed the previous season due to a knee problem until they played 2-2 against Villarreal but believes that will motivate Rangers to work even harder.
"It was a good point", said the 31-year-old, "because Villarreal is a strong team.
We went into the game hoping to win something, but we came out with a point.
We may have won the game, but playing equally is also a good thing.
They played well in the first half, but in the second half we dominated the game.
On Thursday, the European teams will also face off.
We hope to get three points but that will be a tough game as they won the last game, but as we will have a lot of supporters I am sure we will work hard and we will win.
Last summer, things were tough, with injuries and some changes in the club, but now things are going well.
The team and the players are happy; and the training is going well.
I hope we move forward, forget about the past quarter and succeed.
Women sleep through the night afraid of this retirement savings scheme
Although the respondents to the survey knew exactly how they wanted to be cared for, few had discussed the matter with their families.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide said they had discussed long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent have ever spoken to their children about the subject.
Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance business at Nationwide, said: People want to be cared for by their families, but they do not take steps to discuss the matter.
We should start with envy.
Communicate with your mate and children: You cannot expect your family to care for you if you do not tell them in advance what you want to happen.
Talk to your health care provider and your family about where and how you will receive care, since such decisions will affect the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor may help you to find a way to pay for those expenses.
The way you choose to pay for long-term care may involve taking out a standard long-term care insurance policy, combining the insurance policy with the money you have saved to cover those costs, or investing your wealth  as long as you still have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Settle past legal issues.
Have a health-care provider's instructions and give them to a trusted person who will make sure that you receive medical care and medical attention that is in harmony with your wishes, in case you cannot speak.
Also, get a lawyer to handle your financial matters.
You can appoint a trusted person to make decisions about your finances and to make sure that you pay your bills if you are no longer able to care for yourself.
Consider a few simple facts: Suppose an aging parent has an emergency and is rushed to the hospital.
Can you tell which medications you are taking and which are causing you allergies?
Write down those notes so that they are readily available.
Martin: It's not just about money, what about doctors?
What about the drug?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put those things in order.
Man shot multiple times in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times while walking home at night.
The man in his 40's was in the Ilfracombe area, Oxford Grove, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Officials say the shooting, which occurred at 02:30 BST, is just an extension of the crime.
The victim does not see the shooter.
The accidents are so bad that the police call on people to give a witness.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials say, and the number is expected to rise in the coming years.
With no communication system, relief officials cannot determine the situation in Donggala, north of Palu and near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the storm.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of the peninsula on the west coast of Sulawesi island, and had a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala stretches along the northwest coast of Sulawesi and is over 300 kilometers (180 miles) long.
The area, which is the administrative center of the province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the backbone of the economy in Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donngala.
Nickel mining is another important industry in the province, but it is especially prevalent in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Society, Palu and Donngala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active region and earthquakes are common there.
Some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in that area in recent years are:
2004: A magnitude magnitude earthquake struck the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26 and caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coastal region, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra toward the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake in one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causes a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroys several villages and kills at least 300 people.
2016: A moderate earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and alarm as people remember the damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred this time, but the collapse of buildings killed over 100 people.
2018: A massive earthquake struck the popular tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of tourists in temporary distress.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Confronted Charges of Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska mayor and former vice president candidate Sarah Palin, is in custody on charges of sexual assault.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with reporting the situation and refusing to be arrested, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, he took the phone away from an acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report a crime.
THE KTUU reports that Palin is still in custody at Mat-Su Prison and must post a $500 bail.
He reportedly appeared in court on Saturday, where he said "I am not guilty in fact" when asked if he was guilty or not.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor charges, which mean she could be sentenced to a year in prison and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with Class B misconduct, which carries a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, she was charged with assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the incident.
The case is still pending before the Alaska Military Veterans Association.
In January 2016, he was charged with inciting domestic violence, reporting the violence, and carrying a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend reports that he hit him in the face with a fist.
Military hero groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD associated with being in the military in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications equipment broke down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming years.
The quake struck just off the island of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
People are posting videos on social media showing this happening.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors file special motion for death sentence for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
New York state prosecutors want Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack, in which eight people died, sentenced to death  an unusual punishment since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly hired a truck to attack people on a bicycle lane on West Side Highway, Lower Manhattan, burning cyclists and pedestrians to death in Oct.
To pass a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight people deliberately and that he injured people deliberately, according to a death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could carry the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder related to corruption, an indictment that lawyers often refer to organized crime, and an indictment of violence and vandalism.
In explaining how Saipov committed the "cruel, brutal, and horrific act", the lawyers said the attack required him to sit down and plan it.
The petition stated: "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injured, grieved, and caused the loss of family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of those killed were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years had passed since the Southern District of New York had a case leading to the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Court documents said that Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of calm for days and months after the attack.
One officer said that she told the investigators that she felt happy.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to do so after he watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
The police officer said he also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room where he was being treated.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's lawyers, said he was "very disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutors.
Patton says: I think that the decision to appeal the death penalty rather than accepting that the defendant plead guilty and be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole only prolongs the time that everyone will spend in pain.
Saipov's legal team had asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to rally the crowd today at a rally held during the Tory rally.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should be wary of people opposed to the EU's powers just as one of Theresa May's MPs said it should be conducting EU negotiations.
Peter Bone, a conservative MP, spoke at a rally in Birmingham and said the UK would have left a long time ago if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces is to unite the opposing sides in her party, exacerbated by anti-Brexit supporters holding different anti-Brexit demonstrations.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his policy of flexibility with Chequers because of attacks by Brexit supporters, anti-Brexit and EU.
His colleagues say he must continue to negotiate with Brussels despite the opposition - and force those against EU empowerment and the Labour party to choose between a policy with him or riots.
Speaking at a protest in Solihull called From Means to Means, Mr Bone said he wanted to Dissolve Chequers.
He said that Mr. Farage should be placed in the same position and given the responsibility of attending the talks on Brussels.
He said that if it was hoja who was running them, we would have left long ago.
MP Wellingborough added: I support Brexit but we should dissolve Chequers.
Speaking of his opposition to the EU, he said: We do not fight in world wars to be made subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: The story that the British people have changed their minds and want to be candidates is not true.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also present at the rally, and told reporters: All I want to say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people don't like Chequers, the Opposition don't like it, our party members don't like it and the freedom fighters who elected us.
Please put the Chequers thing aside and listen.
In a message addressed to Mrs May, he added: The Prime Minister will remain prime minister as long as he keeps his promises.
Mr Farage said that for the protesters, politicians should be given a shot if they want to compromise on the 2016 referendum decisions.
He said, Now the issue at stake here is trust between us  the people  and our political leaders.
They want to get off the ground on Brexit and today we tell them we will not let them do that.
In a message to a thronged crowd, he said: I want our political leaders, who are about to leave Brexit, to feel the heat down.
We are rallying the people's army in this country that has given us victory over Brexit and we will not rest until we have an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city square.
Freedom fighters were holding anti-Brexit placards after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservative party over the security problems of the app they use.
He added: They are the people who say they can make IT software and all the technological stuff for Canada and that, and that, they make efficient business connections everywhere without borders in Ireland.
They add: That is just a myth.
Brexit is not good.
Warren prepares to consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump, is running for the November election against GOP candidate Geoff Diehl, who was chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There have been rumors that he may be a contender for Trump in 2020.
The meeting held Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th in the district since Trump took office.
One in the audience asked him if he would run for president.
Warren replied that this is the time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Suspect in LSU Sims' shooting arrested
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspected murderer in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at an ET news conference that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m.
They released a video showing the shooter on Friday, asking for help in locating the man.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247 sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday: Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result.
Wayde was helping a friend when he was about to be shot.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was there, with a gun, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not fight when arrested and is imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-9, Baton Rouge native, had played in 32 games last season averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton narrowly missed out on the world title after team rules saw him win over Sebastian Vettel.
It was clear from Valtteri Bottas' finish ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a big part in the race.
From the start, Bottas set himself up first and surprised Hamilton by defending his spot in the first two corners and putting Vettel in competition with his teammates.
Vettel moved past and left Hamilton stuck in traffic, which must have been the deciding factor.
Mercedes stopped later and came in behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved past after the break and the Ferrari driver reluctantly cleared the way for him, thinking he would lock him in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and finished seventh in the final leg of the race that started on his 21st birthday.
He then set out to finish fastest in the main part of the race and passed Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally stopped in the 44th lap but was unable to improve in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It was a difficult day as Valtteri had done a fine job all weekend and had shown that he was a real man.
The team did a great job of taking first and second place", said Hamilton.
That Was a Bad Sign
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting held on Saturday for insisting that she had not released a confidential letter to the Supreme Court from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he said that the events in the Senate showed that people are wicked, cruel, and unfaithful.
The only thing that can happen and good that happened in the last few days in the Senate, is to see people angry, showing malice, cruelty and disloyalty.
When you look at the news reported in the media, they say, 'Oh, not me.
I don't know anything.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, is this document from you?
Remember his answer... you were the one who issued this document - , what?
No, he did not.
I didn't take out any paperwork myself.
Stop, slowly forward.
Did we release the document... No, we didn't release it", he added in a deep voice of a senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter in July outlining the charges Ford is charging Kavanaugh with, and the details of the letter came out in early September, but Feinstein denied that his office had issued them.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, nor did I reveal his details, Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
He had asked me to keep the matter a secret and I kept it a secret as he asked.
But his comment seemed to have caught the president's eye, who said about the matter at a meeting on Saturday: You know what, that was a bad sign.
He may not have done so, but that was a sign of a dire situation.
Defending a Supreme Court nominee, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said that the Democrats are using those accusations to advance their own agenda.
They want to return to power by any means necessary.
You can see clearly that they are wicked and cruel in that they don't care who they hurt or trample as long as they can get power and authority, the media says these are the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars wiped their tears of defeat by Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by returning the bat to the tree on Saturday when they played home Dundee by beating them 5-3.
The Giants took the lead with two points from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored before Dwyer put the Giants back in first place.
Francois Bouchard re-measured Dundee's points before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored the two points that gave them the win.
It was the third time Adam Keefe's team had lost in the Elite League, which on Friday in Belfast beat Dundee 2-1, although they had been eliminated first.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams had met, and the Giants had won three previous games.
Dwyer scored the opening goal at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave Beauvillier the first goal four minutes later.
The game started with a bang, and Sullivan scored at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the lead to tie the score at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead in the first half of the game when he scored the second touchdown late in the night.
Dundee rearranged and Bouchard scored on a power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen put Dundee first towards the end of the game and ensure his team stayed ahead until the tide turned.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies While Rescuing Hundreds From Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero for his role in ensuring the safe descent of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and scores more were missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Another earthquake followed, and many people were trapped in the rubble of Palu.
Although his fellow workers fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his desk in a shaky tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was preparing to take off, departed safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Australian ABC News reports that Yohannes Sirait, the Indonesian Air Transport Administrator, says that decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We called a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in a village.
But sadly, he died that morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken", he adds.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll may reach thousands as the national relief organization says it is difficult to reach the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
The spokesperson for the organization, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, says: We believe that number is increasing as many bodies are still under the rubble and we have not been able to remove them.
A six-meter-high wave destroyed Palu, which will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are bringing relief.
Risa Kusama, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance brings bodies every now and then.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors but we don't know what we will find there when we arrive.
The situation is already bad, but it can get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: I ask you to work day and night to do everything necessary to evacuate people from the area.
Are you ready to fall into the trap? CNN reports.
Earlier this summer, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crashes into water
The pilots of the plane that crashed in Pacific waters, Micronesia, now say one person is missing, while earlier they had said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In an announcement issued by Air Niugini on Saturday afternoon, it said that it did not know the whereabouts of another male passenger.
The airline says it is working with authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to locate the man.
The flight crew was reluctant to provide information about the passenger, such as his age or ethnicity.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all are in stable condition.
It is not known what caused the crash or what happened before it.
U.S. air traffic controllers and the U.S. Navy say the plane crashed in waters near the airstrip.
Some witnesses think that the plane passed the airport by mistake.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, says that the plane went too low.
Jaynes: That was a great story.
Jaynes says that he and others managed to walk through the waist-deep water from the sinking aircraft's life-saving doors.
He says that the flight attendants were terrified and shouted that he had suffered a few head injuries.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors who were working nearby to clean up the harbor also helped by using a pump-boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
Information provided by the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in the past two decades in air crashes registered in PNG, but those accidents have nothing to do with Air Niugini.
Investigator says woman burned alive at night
The court rested on Saturday in the case of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
An investigator at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, spent hours testifying as an expert in criminal investigations.
He showed the court how he used cellphone records to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night of her murder.
The Clarion Ledger reports that Rowlett says he has found evidence from several cell phones showing locations Tellis went with Chambers on the night he was killed, contradicting what he had said earlier.
When evidence showed that Chambers had his cell phone at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interview Sanford.
Sanford gave a witness on Saturday and said that he was not there that day.
When the lawyers asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was not telling the truth, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another fact that Tellis did not tell was that he had known Chambers for about two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records show that you only knew him for a week
Rowlett says that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, phone calls, and personal information from her phone.
Hale says: She erased him from her life.
His lawyers are expected to file a motion on Sunday.
The judge says that he expects the case to be heard by the court later that day.
The High Breed: What does hip hop teach about social problems?
Three hip hop musicians want to change the bad name that the music has made for itself by composing songs with helpful lyrics.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, say hip hop has moved away from its original message of political and social solutions.
It wants to go back to the roots of this music and re-populate hip hop that teaches about social problems.
Bands like the Fugees and Common have also become popular in the UK thanks to musicians like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York child-care provider sues couple after they send racist messages
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissing her because of racism after she mistakenly received a text from her mother complaining that she is another black person.
The couple denied that they were prejudiced, comparing the charge to a bribery.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed frustration with Giselle Maurice, who came to care for her children until 2016, and realized she was black.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband a message that read, OOOOOOOOOOWE ONE BLACK MAN AGAIN.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing that she had lost it, Plasco-Flaxman  now uncomfortable fired Ms. Maurice on the grounds that the child-care worker who had left had been a bully and was black, now looking for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was given a day's rest and then driven home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for firing him and demanding $350 a day for the six months he was originally hired to work and live there, although they had not signed a contract.
He told the Post on Friday, I want to show them that they shouldn't do something like that and added I know it's discrimination.
The couple denied the accusation of prejudice, saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice, since they had lost confidence in him after they had hurt him.
My wife accidentally sent him that text.
He is not partial.
We are not a racist society, her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
Would you leave your children with the person you have hurt, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Be honest with yourself.
Plasco likened the charge to a "cold hand", and said that his wife had only had a baby for two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you now contend with such a man?
And that's not the right thing to do", adds the banker.
Although the case is still pending, many on social media criticize the couple, disapprove of their conduct and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington's editors fear that readers will not understand the bear's story.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who will have read it for the first time before the book is published.
That's surprising, since we now know how successful Paddington was.
She says her father, who had been filming for the BBC before he was moved to write a children's book featuring a small teddy bear, could have been more optimistic about his work when it was criticized, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "both a happy and a sad news" after her father died last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "the most important person in our family", she adds that her father was proud of his achievements.
"HE was a quiet person and did not like to repeat himself", she says.
But since Paddington was real to her, it was as if she had a child who had accomplished something: she was happy with his success even though you had not worked hard.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Although it was his writing and invention, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
Upon arrival, she found her daughter rushed to the Nices Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors were working hard to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse says: Nad kept calling me, telling me that it was bad and the doctors didn't think the daughter would live.
Then I got a call from Nad telling me that your daughter was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
I did just that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medication doctors had prescribed to help his heart beat was gradually leaking out of his body.
She was already dead but had just left the body.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was over.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to control myself.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, finally boarded the plane with other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
You say: No one knew.
I bowed my head, and tears just poured down my face.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt the most compassion for Nad that I can describe.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved the girl.
Two widowed women place cards on the bridge to prevent people from committing suicide
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have long placed cards with encouraging messages on the Welsh bridge and telephone numbers for people to call in case of emergency.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
She says: I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that her son was a good cook and had a winning smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up the house.
But he quit his job shortly before he committed suicide, having been deeply depressed.
In 2014, Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, was found by his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis says: I am always worried that this will harm her too.
Ms. Davis made cards, to tell people that there are people to go to or talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't rush the subject  you have to talk.
Ms. Humpherys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"She didn't mean that she was depressed or depressed", he says.
A few days before Christmas we realized that he was not the man we knew.
She was so stressed about Christmas  when the children opened their gifts she couldn't look them in the eye or do anything.
She says that her death has caused them great pain, but they have to deal with the situation: It has caused a big rift in the family.
It broke our spirit.
But we all have to fight and move on.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as FBI investigations begin
I thought that if we could find something close to what he was asking for  limited-term and limited-time investigations  we might be able to bring some unity, Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "disbanded" because of the political party controversy.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
They procrastinate because of time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections, November 6th, and if, as the Republicans expect, he does not perform well, that will undermine their efforts to elect the person they want to the state's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators, recruiting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush when he was in the White House and met his wife Ashley there, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen if the FBI does not file a report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republican and 49 Democratic seats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to secure at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to resolve the issue and install him on the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans going to the military has reduced under the Kim regime
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans moving to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the South Korean branch office, Park Byeong-seug said that last year's donation was 1,127 , compared with 2,706 in 2011.
One factor, says Mr. Park, is the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the high demands of creditors.
Pyongyang did not offer any comment.
Most North Koreans who emigrate to South Korea end up being granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have entered South Korea illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Many flee through China, which forms a long and easily traveled valley with North Korea, rather than the heavily fortified border between the two countries.
China considers those fleeing North Korea illegal immigrants rather than refugees, so it forces them to return home.
North and South Korea are still at war, although the situation has improved somewhat in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that had been postponed on the issue of nuclear disarmament.
This came after President Donald Trump held a special meeting in June with Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the US sanctions are the slowing down of progress.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, New York, Mr Ri said: If we do not trust the US, we cannot be sure that our country is safe and in such a situation, we cannot remain unarmed.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "feeling bad", and unfit to be on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is "feeling emotionally awkward", and is not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
Speaking about Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Pelosi said: I believe that if it was a woman who did it, it would have been considered emotional.
Kavanaugh raised eyebrows when he denied that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
Kavanaugh's emotions rose as he wrote his story and at times even sounded like he was yelling and gasping when talking about his family and high school.
He also quickly criticized the Democrats on the committee, saying that the charges against him were "just a smear campaign" made up by people who are heartbroken because Hilary Clinton lost the presidential election.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he had shown that he was biased against Democrats.
He said, I think he was the one who made the mistake of saying those words and the way he made fun of the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi was stunned when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if found guilty and if the Democrats would win the House vote.
Pelosi said: I would say  if he's lying to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, even the one he's on now.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned that Kavanaugh might rule against the Affordable Care Act or in the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered an anti-revisionist judge.
At a pre-inauguration meeting, Kavanaugh responded to questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
Pelosi said: This is not the time to take a sensitive person to court and expect us to say, good news indeed.
Wives Need to Show It.
It is a righteous anger, months and years of wrath, and he cannot speak about it without weeping.
Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later: We cry when we're angry.
I guess that's what most of us do, isn't it?
She adds, I was helped by a woman who was a police officer in another area, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but that she had invented a way to control her anger and started crying, saying to the person talking to her, YOU might think I was hurt because I was crying.
I am angry.
Then he continued speaking.
I thought that was wonderful.
It is okay to express anger by weeping because people do not fully understand this.
One of the first things I remember about working in an office filled with men was one day I found myself crying in a rage, and an older woman  who was a harsh-faced boss whom I feared  pulled me by a scarf around my neck to the corner of the stairs.
He said: "Don't let them see you cry.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're hurt and will be glad to have it.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found with a prostitute on board the Monkey Business and decided to quit running, Ms. Schroede was very upset, but she decided that there was no reason for her not to run for president.
He told me 30 years later, That was a bad decision.
There were already seven other candidates, and they did not need to add to that number.
Another person was missing was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had begun long ago and he was behind in raising funds, he vowed not to run unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a heady day.
She noticed that some of her supporters were giving $1,000 to the men, and she was only giving $250.
I thought, Do they think I'm getting things at a discount?
In his speech announcing that he would not run, he was so moved that he shook his voice in gratitude to those who had supported him, expressing his frustration with a system that makes it difficult to raise funds and that makes it harder for voters to get elected, and with discrimination against women.
Commenting on the way the media treated her, Ms. Schroeder says: "You'd think I was crazy.
You would think that Kleenex was my financial sponsor.
I remember thinking in my heart, 'What will they write on my tombstone?'
HE cried?
How the US-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
Experts say the sound of the US-China trade war is deafening, and since the war will not end now, the distance between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued an early warning earlier this summer when he imposed tariffs on major Chinese products including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Tariffs have been high this week as new tariffs were introduced on goods worth $200 billion ($200 billion [£150 billion]), in fact taxing half of all US imports from China.
Beijing has retaliated by recently raising taxes by five to ten percent on U.S. assets worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to compete with the US and the world's second richest country is not going to back down.
For Washington to withdraw from this war would mean accepting China's terms, but for China to submit to the US would also be a disappointment to Chinese president Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war could benefit China by separating the two countries from economic dependence.
Abigail Grace, a researcher on Asian affairs at the New American Security Institute, says: "The rash decisions of Washington or Beijing may cause more serious economic problems than observers think.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to welcome returning refugees
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees who choose to return and is asking for aid to rebuild the country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
He says: The situation is now relatively stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to rebuild the places destroyed by terrorism to bring life back to normal.
Now the conditions are right for refugees to voluntarily return to their homelands, where they had fled terrorism and economic hardships that made it difficult for them to provide for their families.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still in the country need relief.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian government would appreciate help in rebuilding the devastated land.
But he emphasized that they would not accept conditional or foreign aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup, Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they beat Team USA by 16.5 points while the USA scored 10.5 points, while playing at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
It is now the sixth consecutive time the U.S. has been defeated on European soil and last won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe was ahead of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
Phil Mickelson, a US sprinter, finished the game with a hard-hitting backhand to throw his first par-3 ball into the water on the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian skipper excelled at the game, becoming one of only four players to reach 5-0-0 since the game was introduced in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America was eliminated in the 5&4 by junior European Team player Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, was outscored 2 to 1 by England's Ian Poulter, who was probably playing his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia of Spain, an eight-time Ryder Cup winner, has been the most successful player in European competition with 25.5 points.
I rarely cry, but today I can't help it.
And the summer is hard.
I thank Thomas for lifting me up and showing confidence in me.
I am so happy to have found this cup again.
It's a winning team, and I'm proud that I was able to contribute to that win", said Garcia, who is emotionally affected by the European win.
He passes the torch to teammate John Ram who beat Tiger Woods, US golf champion, 2&1 on Sunday in the singles event.
Rahm, 23, said: I feel very proud to have won Tiger Woods, I've watched his games.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and currently has a 13-21-3 record in Ryder Cup games.
It is an amazing record for one of the leading players, having won 14 major trophies and second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has been hard-pressed to win this week except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a fine game of golf at those games.
The captain of the US team, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a time when we were playing for the European team.
We tried.
We serve Thomas a toast.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players are very good.
We're going to reorganize, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 brothers and have the privilege of working with them.
We deserve to honor them.
The game has us beat.
