Nine-Year-Old Boy Found Escaped in New York
Police have been on a search for a 9-year-old boy who escaped in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A disappearance report about a boy who had gone out of West Tampere with his boyfriend has spread on social media.
According to the police, the child has been contacted and is not in danger of life or health.
The boy’s father told the Evening-Sanom at midnight that the boy had been found.
He is well, and we are now going to start the investigation.
The boy was found near the house, the father told me.
Ronaldo once again crushed Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to play in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goalkeeping turned at least for a moment in favor of the latter.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goalkeeper statistics when he shot guest Shahtar Donetsky into the net with two hits on penalty shots and one on the pitch.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80, after having 77 goals at the Barcelona Mess, which had been matched with him before Tuesday.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has compiled in the Italian football league in Serie A from the beginning of the season, but in the Champions League Group D it started strongly with a 2-1 visiting victory over Manchester City.
The goal was scored ten minutes before Juventus’s Alvaro Morata.
The City attack was annoyed by the absence of the kneeling Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's league game, arrived on the pitch only in the last ten minutes.
Manchester United also suffered a tough match in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU’s 20-year-old goalkeeper Luke Shaw’s visiting match lasted only a quarter of an hour.
PSV’s Hector Moreno’s dangerous-looking slide hit the ManU squad so badly that Shaw probably broke his ankle.
Shaw lay on the lawn of his home stadium in Eindhoven for ten minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay led the guests 1-0 in the 41st minute, but ManU’s joy only lasted a few minutes.
Moreno plunged ahead of the break.
PSV won in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
In the Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain played in the A-Group.
Manchester United’s Angel Di Maria was the Argentine player.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball to the back of Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored PSG 2-0.
PSG is among the most successful.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which belongs to the league’s small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will face Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, Moscow TsSKA, lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in a B-Group match in Germany.
Opposition calls for immediate resignation: President made the wrong speech
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has held the same speech in parliament last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The main opposition party MDC has urged Mugabe to resign as this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that confusion had only occurred in Mugabe’s staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe’s speech addressed the impact of China on the country’s economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria call for emergency summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have called for an extraordinary summit next week over the refugee crisis.
President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, will review the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to more effectively register Europeans.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are on the table of the interior ministers.
Teacher Admits Shooting His Girlfriend During Emergency Call
Voice only slightly coloured university teacher Shannon Lamb tells police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his “golden dog” is alive and probably shocked, and said the contact details of the dead woman’s close relatives can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten message on the side of the hatred: "I'm so sorry I hope I can cancel this loved Amya and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," the letter, according to experts, is signed by Lamb.
Nothing suggested that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Minnesota’s Cleveland Delta State University, had already travelled 500 miles to the school’s campus, where police believe he shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this workshop.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard of the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said Lamb had called a fatal emergency call some time later.
By the end of the day, the number of dead increased by one more: Lamb committed suicide as police surrounded his vein.
Authorities were still trying to find out Lamb’s motives a day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to a school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released data showing that students and staff described Lambia as a talented teacher who, however, may have had problems.
The students said they were waiting for his feelings.
Police in Prentiss's deathplace, Gautier, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked “great people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended both men’s courses.
However, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lambia, but said she also looked nervous and restless, “as if something was wrong.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lambin told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously applied for sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s remuneration policies meant that while Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career advancement and an assistant professor’s position.
William LaForge, the university’s rector, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that “obviously there was something in Lamb’s mind.”
To these questions, Lamb can no longer answer.
After Lamb had escaped from the campus, police caught him as he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about one-and-a-half kilometers south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, said Methel Johnson, a death investigator in Washington County.
Lamb’s car was still on the road.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and educational sciences. The University has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctorate in education science in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old when they met through common friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite charming at that time.
All the girls were melting wax when she was there, said now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been together for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the riverfront in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband Shawn O’Steen said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
“She’s really upset,” O’Steen described her daughter.
He was his mother’s best friend.
O’Steen said he hadn’t met Lambia, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together in a show.
O’Steen told me that her daughter is making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barman and occasional entertainer at The Julep Room near Gautier, says he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5 when Lamb had stopped performing his guitar and lipstick to a few people.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We played and tossed each other.
They were both pretty clever.
The deceased teacher Schmidt led a first-year student seminar program and specialized in Indian and colonial history, said school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was a spokesman for his brotherhood and the Student Council.
On Tuesday evening, a candlestick was held on the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attending about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the fair, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Betrayal from Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that police now say Lamb had called an emergency call after Schmidt’s shooting, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss’s wife during the call, there is no evidence that they had been married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, but a toy and baby product dealer says it will allow existing permanent and seasonal workers to do more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 in the holiday season in 2014.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Even though there are months of holidays, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores as well as the sale, shipping and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his date with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film Back to the Future was an important moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was also important for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that my seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” she said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The movie begins and I think I’m just a handshake and a stretch of hand away from my date with the princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary from Back to the Future, which interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “For me, it’s undoubtedly the greatest time travel film of all time.”
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD, and in some cinemas in October.
UN Secretary-General says Syria cannot be resolved by armed means
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is that this five-year conflict “will not be solved armed,” and additional weapons will only aggravate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said in a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the General Assembly ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division between the Council, the Syrian people and regional powers “has made it impossible to resolve the situation.”
Ban urged the five permanent member states to show the same solidarity and consensus when dealing with the Syrian crisis as they showed when they agreed on Iran’s nuclear program.
8 Survey Results That Prove Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to label him a wind wave.
Others see it as a joke.
Some are waiting for collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to silence Donald Trump out of the top of the polls, it has not (still) been successful.
Of the last 11 national polls in ten, Donald Trump has been leading with a two-digit figure, and some have started seriously wondering what this means for real estate king appointment opportunities.
The election is only at the beginning.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to be a Republican candidate.
Commentators note that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership position to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom got a single state behind in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
External groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth, however, have noticed Trump’s tenacity and have begun to use their funds to overthrow him.
The following recent survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a transient phase:
Trump’s popularity figures have made a full swing.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans favored the real estate king.
By mid-July this figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans are favorable to Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of ten people say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a poll conducted by the University of Quinnipace in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they favored Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “happy” if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be “shocked” if he became a candidate.
Ben Carson alone generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% “enthusiastic” versus Trump’s 40%).
The most exciting?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans would be “unhappy” or “shocked” if Jeb Bush, the leader’s favorite, became a candidate.
Trump’s fierce nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his powerful speeches and insults, according to a Monday ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republican-linked voters nationally think that the real estate king has a proper character for the president.
According to a Quinnipace poll last week, in the Iowa state that hosted the first party congress, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has a proper character quality for a leader.
However, according to a poll by ABC/Post, 44 percent think that his character is not suitable to serve as president, and six out of ten believe that his character does not belong to the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think that Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of ten Americans thought Trump was the most likely choice when asked who was most likely to be the Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten voted in favour of Jeb Bush.
Data Disclosure: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball at their disposal.
During the last term at this time, four out of ten Republicans were of the opinion that Rick Perry would be nominated as a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider Trump’s campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans voted in favour of another candidate, Trump would win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership as anti-Trump support has been divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gets the majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He is in a relationship with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win?
If they were to face each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump with a huge 18 point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of Trump-backed voters have decided who their vote goes to.
The situation can, of course, change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that he would never change his mind.
46% said they could potentially change candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest rival at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rape” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s powerlessness will drive Latin voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so will Donald Trump.
The frustration with the government has risen to a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in an ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose a non-political person than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A two-week survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are “unhappy” and 21 percent are “truly angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's interrogation
Corbyn's first appearance on the questioning hour has been eagerly awaited since his election
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn meets Prime Minister David Cameron for the first time.
Corbyn stands up to ask his first six questions shortly after noon, and is likely to be closely watched by both the media and Labour MPs.
Corbyn has called for “less theatre and more facts” for this weekly show.
He also said he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn’s leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the central trade union organization on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision by the leader of the Labour Party to remain silent during the national anthem ceremony held on Tuesday on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain war has sparked criticism among Conservative MPs and appeared in several front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention
Corbyn’s spokesman said he “stated respectfully silent” and that he acknowledged “the courage of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War.”
Corbyn’s shadow government member, Owen Smith, told BBC’s Twon Newsnight that he would have urged the leader of the Labour Party to sing a national anthem despite his opinion that the royal house should be shut down.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be part of Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Initially, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says the differences between the party’s position in the European Union and the government’s subsidy ceiling have also “settled” within the Labour Party since Corbyn’s appointment.
Corbyn said at a central trade union meeting that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Shadow Government’s Labour and Retirement Secretary Smith said the party was “pretty clear” that they were only opposed to the government’s plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has encountered in the last decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has “assembled” ideas as questions to the prime minister, and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the Prime Minister’s questioning hours are too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both clever speech and speech, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said the shadow government's finance secretary, Angela Eagle, will act as his deputy at the interrogation hours when Corbyn is not present - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues might sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said he has approached House Speaker John Bercow for the matter.
When Cameron took office in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theatre that is often associated with the prime minister's questioning hours, but he was later forced to admit his failure.
Since they began to be broadcast on television in 1990, the Prime Minister’s Questionnaire has been an important measure in assessing the leader’s discretion, his control of the House, and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized the questionnaire for turning it into a mere iris calling for far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless youths are trained to be photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
‘I was shot in Joburg’ is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit.
BBC News met one of the first young graduates of the project.

The pound will rise as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers appeared to rise in UK wage growth, and at the same time, the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK salaries, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9 percent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009 and was thought to bring with it estimates of a rise in rates.
The pound rose more than one percent against the dollar to $1.5505 and 0.84 percent against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49 percent to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most prominent stock on the market, rising by 20 percent after competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would bring together the world’s two largest brewers and brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s stock rose 0.9 percent after encouraging news from the competing luxury group Richmont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China – Burberry’s key market – had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt cutting strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mond shares were among the index’s biggest drops by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs shifted its recommendation from the company to the “sell” form.
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company released data on its six-month income before taxes: an 83% increase to £46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Hurt Expansion
Peter Cowgill, chief executive of JD Sports, said a minimum wage raise in the UK could mean that “potential consumers’ purchasing power will increase.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labor costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could go to the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash Launches Grassroots Campaign Against Aldi Industry Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi’s attack in South and West Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldi’s $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia with up to 120 stores. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food brokers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and buyers have jumped in, and brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo’s offer snacks in IGA stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their loyal customers.
Metcasch is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29, as this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron goods hosts an annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia together account for 30 percent of Metcasch’s IGA area, with revenue margins higher than those of Metcasch’s Eastern IGA network.
In South and Western Australia, shopping is well known to be around the corner, and IGA retailers have a much larger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 percent in the south and 24 percent in the west compared to 14 percent in the eastern states.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will seize about 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million in sales annually and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west, generating $500 million and $600 million in revenue in these regions.
Loss of food and food sales and amounts at Metcash’s high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in business profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcasch’s food and food sales will decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could “very likely lose in a decade.”
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass’s comments.
However, it is understood that a member of the Metcasch board would have contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has decreased from 18% since 2010 to 14% and revenue from Metcas’s food and food business, which delivers products to approximately 1,200 IGA dealers, has decreased by 43% since 2012.
However, the wholesale retains its side, and has invested more than $150 million annually to lower prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers renovate stores by adding faster growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of products from private brands to the market.
Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcas, says lower prices and improving stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as an outsider in a recent storm that has swept around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism for his own behavior, says Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy.
The younger member of the talented twin called “Special Ks” Kokkinakis was unwittingly exposed in the case where Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in the final match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to separate Kokkinakis from his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, when Harrison declared, “Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios, and I should have hit that cock.”
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his goals after a crash ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been Kokkinakis’ stubborn defender.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for second place in a duel with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
“I’m pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi has just been pulled into the scourge,” Healy said.
He broke his goal when he lost because of a crash at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break his goal when frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, even in rather provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a bit harshly.
He is very mature by the age of 19, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in good shape and is a fairly calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to involve Kyrgios in the important games starting on Friday, describing this “joint decision” as a good solution for all, but still supporting the Canberra’s return to the team’s regular outfit.
“We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And Nick has grown up really fast, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, for example, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it will be best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from public thinking about these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, detaining those trying to enter the country illegally.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a neutral territory, and Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
People who fled the violence of their homelands have now set up their tents and settled for an indefinite period between the checkpoints of the two countries.
But the frustration grew.
As the police helicopter stood above them, the migrants yelled “Open the border!” and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water for protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said it would be “unacceptable” to return migrants from Hungary as more and more migrants arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
“(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to harm civilians.
The discussion must take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Conflict on the border between Hungary and Serbia arose after a group of 28 nationalities failed to reach a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed on the sharing of responsibilities for the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now seized Italy and Greece. The ministers spoke hopefully of reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will accept additional 120,000 refugees, including part of Hungary.
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an extraordinary EU summit next week to discuss the migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbors or Brussels will act soon.
Tuesday’s state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed roads to be closed and asylum proceedings to be accelerated.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the border with Serbia is ready, the country will also set up a clay fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the flood of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the silk-line fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees in search of a better life, and not those fleeing war, who are entitled to protection - this view is heavily contradicted by other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime the attempt to cross or damage a 4-foot (13-foot) silk rope fence that the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government has declared a state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament still needs to formally approve the military stationing expected next week, but Associated Press journalists on the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban’s domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 people who had already crossed the border.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now detained by the police, and are accused of violations defined in the new laws.
The authorities repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing points on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning after sending a silk-covered train wagon to close one of those places.
The main border crossing near Roszkea, Hungary, was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to handle people and crowds began to enter.
About 20 entered, but thousands remained outside.
A group of migrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they will refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: National poll shows Hillary Clinton's lead to Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton continues to lead the Democratic nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders has arrested her.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is backed by 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will run for president, but he is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democratic voters say it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
But Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choice more firmly than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has declined among several population groups since last month’s CBS News Poll poll, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton has a strong leadership among women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
Her popularity among men has declined significantly, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton’s lead among Democrats under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he is now at the level of Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly leading among older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double figure among the liberals, but now Sanders leads this group with five percentage points.
More than half of Democrats say they will support Clinton if she becomes a party candidate.
A quarter say they support him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are very likely eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing among those who currently don’t support Clinton – only a quarter would enthusiastically support him.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, less than 35 percent of Republican voters say the same about Republican leader Donald Trump.
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted her to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that she had the appropriate experience (16 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Given the vice president’s influence on a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race — even though a third disagrees.
When asked by Democratic voters who they would vote for second party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the Democratic candidacy, Hillary Clinton’s leadership over Sanders will rise.
55 percent of Democrats believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
With this measure, Biden is far behind, but the proportion of those who consider him the most eligible to vote has grown.
When Democratic voters were asked what was most important to a candidate, however, they raised their opinions over voting.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party’s voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, trustworthy, and strong leaders.
Biden is best at honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
30 percent of Democratic voters say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
Looking at all these aspects, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion about Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State still raises questions, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation on the matter and say the matter did not affect their general opinion about her.
This is different when you look at the United States as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The opinions of the people divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
The majority of Americans say the email controversy hasn’t affected their overall opinion about Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion about her has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Although voters in Clinton’s own party consider him honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and trustworthy, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62 percent of registered voters say they do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not consider Trump honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many do not have an opinion about him, just like Carson.
The error margin in the survey, which involved 351 Democrat voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In the new poll, two candidates collected half of all votes, leaving the others to fight for their feet.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly supporting Trump, whose support has risen from 23 percent in the previous CBS poll before the Fox News election debate last month to 27 percent in the poll released on Tuesday.
However, Carson increased dramatically from 6% to 23%.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is overtaking Trump among highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field is behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorino and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Governor Scott Walker’s support has fallen most: from last month’s 10 percent to the current 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6 percent.
The error margin of the 376 Republican voters in this latest poll, conducted in September, is +/- 6%.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson is on the rise in polls: he has 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32 percent.
A recent poll by ABC News/Washington Post also found that Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson’s popularity rose last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump’s belief.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Killing a First Year Student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died at a brotherhood sympathy ceremony in the Pocono Mountains district of Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been brought against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chu “Michael” Deng during his membership dispute in September 2013 and then delayed his hospitalization, thereby contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say Deng’s eyes were tied and he was loaded with a backpack of more than 13 pounds full of sand on his back, after which he was repeatedly tapped to the ground as he tried to walk through the ice field towards the goal.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng woke up, but allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search online for information about his symptoms, and contact Brotherhood National Chairman Andy Meng for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus, in practice, put the well-being of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng,” police chief Wagner said.
Deng was unable to work, and he died the next morning.
According to the body opening protocol, Deng was repeatedly hit by a dull object in his head, body, and thighs.
“Too many families have suffered from fraternal punishment, with at least one student dying every year since 1970,” Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County approved that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent bullying and criminal conspiracy.
“We don’t just want individuals to be held accountable, but if there is an organization behind the incident that has officially or informally accepted the situation, they should also be held accountable,” Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood cut off from the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. Central Bank raises interest rates
An increase in interest rates will come, and the markets of rising rates will collapse, the yields of bonds will rise, and the economy will have to go into recession.
This we know.
What we do not know is how long this all will take or how long it will take.
The past does not help much with timing, especially when it comes to the economy.
The recession has lasted only 11 months since the first increase, and sometimes it has lasted as long as 86 months.
The U.S. central bank’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, but not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so vigorously emphasized that investors should not focus on it as interest rates start to rise, but mostly on the course of time for the normalization of the situation.
There are many variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all of the interest rate hikes have been overstated.
“The central bank’s first rise after the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some circles as the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist for global affairs at Capital Economics.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, though still low, to be such a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effects.
Below is an overview of how some aspects of the economy will react based on past developments:
As the markets have seen over the past month, waiting for an interest rate hike can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the impact is not so dramatic.
“It appears that capital yields tend to stop for 12-24 months after the first raise, which again potentially reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the central bank’s raise.
Specifically, over the past 35 years, the markets have generally been strong, up about 14 percent when approaching the increase, 250 days later the situation is fairly steady (an average rise of 2.6 percent), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Nuveen Asset Management’s lead capital strategist Bob Doll, published in Barron’s.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on shares is usually more apparent at a later stage of the raise cycle, when returns begin to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest purchases often contribute to their revenue.
In the current circumstances, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed before and which may accelerate the recession.
This is especially true of GDP, which will be closest to its lowest level ever before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 increases made since 1950, the nominal annual GDP has only been below 4.5 percent twice.
Although the figure in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few believe it will stay, with the third quarter advancing by 1.5 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raise the question of “whether this time will be different,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been prepared to raise the central bank for the whole year, and everyone is looking forward to this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the committee can approve a raise at this meeting, the futures trade predicts only a 25 percent probability.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all elevation cycles have so far occurred in increasing leverage supercycles, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery has begun,” the report says.
In contrast, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited the longest time since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now is running for the 74th month.
Fixed returns have also been volatile as the markets await interest rate increases, and the model somewhat resembles capital observations.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its line, its effects appear faster on bonds than on stocks.
The direction of bond yields seems to change immediately at the first increase/cutting of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the yield of the bonds will fall immediately,” Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that raising interest rates causes convergence of yields on longer and shorter-term bonds, thus leveling the yield curve.
High yield bonds often yield better in such a situation, although “we’re still cautious about finding a return,” said Schwab’s fixed yield analyst Kathy Jones in one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes the markets have already adjusted to the central bank’s line-up expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the markets have adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more steady, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased – all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its line-up.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt are performing worse as the rise in dollar value makes their products more expensive in the global market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have to finance.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in their customer report.
Companies with strong revenue surpassed companies with low revenue by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility stocks performed better than companies of lower quality. The average of the first was 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a big problem.
The companies with a lot of variable interest rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the rise in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit with higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of “populism”
He argues that separating it from the commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just imitating the Brit Awards.
Deputy colleague Damien Collins criticized The Voice, saying it’s not original either
BBC Radio 3 is “transforming” into Classic FM, the senior MP claims, adding to the production company’s pressure to prove that it does something that commercial production companies don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio channel appeared to be “popular” in its content, and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial competitors.
“It seems like Radio 3 — I don’t want to use the term ‘popularity’ — is turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also attended the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
“The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, just seems like a Brit Awards gala under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here’s two examples I’ve recalled right away of when you’re actually just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC CEO denied the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and sharing information with the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
“In addition, I think it’s really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief Alan Davey argued that the channel needs to do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offer that was criticized for stumbling on commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music contest that the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not in any way peculiar?
Lord Hall argued that this BBC1 show, featuring Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced “very in the BBC style.”
He added that he wants the production company to “find success inside its own house” the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to block the production of future seasons of The Voice, or order that licensors' money be spent on other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose the least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the lowest since the start of the statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices for shopping.
Experts believe November’s Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically over the past decade and has turned many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
Experts, however, say there are now signs of an online sales leveling in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7 percent increase for the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew the least since the start of the statistics in 2000: only five percent more than last year.
Experts say there are signs in the air of a leveling of online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7 percent increase in the first quarter of 2015.
“If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would rationalize over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG Sales Index, told The Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it is flat, and (growth) can decrease.
Black Friday is considered one of the reasons behind the slowdown in U.S. trades.
Experts believe that consumers will restrain shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more buyers than the average broke into their computers to catch trades by hacking the websites of multiple traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue about discoveries, may hinder shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made in online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims buried bin Laden's deaths in Mekka
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 dead people across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured when the lift collapsed.
29 dead were carried in the air through the streets as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them.
Surisans, mostly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad passage passed by the holy place, where just a few days ago a lifting barrel fell through the roof of the mosque and overthrew worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial after the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed the bin Laden family's construction company to be responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 worshippers who were killed in the Grand Mosque in Mecca were carried across the streets.
Among the dead was four-child father Qasim Akram Bolton from the Manchester district. He was on his first pilgrimage when the lift collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already vowed that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane’s edge up when it wasn’t in use.
The Arabic version of the decision, published by the state-led Saudi Press Agency, said Binladin Group was partially responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s executives were prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the bullshit to fall on the grand mosque yard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not released any reports of the collapse, and its representatives have not been arrested for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date protection measures and of not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
Around the Grand Mosque in Mecca, there are dozens of lifts that are part of a huge construction project led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, leading major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel boy whom his family banned in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrived in the kingdom for a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim should do at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the dead and permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap workers are behind popularity
Brits are increasingly using the services of assistants, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is on the rise.
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Kingfisher to close 60 B&Q stores across the country
Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent for Daily Mail
Britons are said to give up their hamsters and brushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home repair work.
It seems that if you’re clever with a hammer or a hammer to paint walls, you’re in a minority today.
Brits are hiring more and more helpers to do the do-it-yourself work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home repair chain, said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a low price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in the store are made specifically by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman economies where more household repairs are done than before.
Laury said: “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
Half of our customers, however, are women, and 80% of our product purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women leading the UK’s FTSE100 index’s most important companies. She has rebuilt her management team to have equal number of male and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with just 50 percent of women in the group, including its CEO and Chief Financial Officer.
Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is important here.
It’s not hard to find good leaders.”
Kingfisher a decline in both six-month revenue and sales after the group took over the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, the owner of Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The Three Ace government decided to resort to compulsory legislation to save the country’s economy.
The visible effects occurred quite quickly.
The sharp head of the Federal Federation and other centralized organizations began to force immediately, and as a result, the country stood up on Friday because of the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think that is also reasonable.
I wonder if it is worth it to go on strike.
There were even resistance groups.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the internet to declare that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but are going to work.
In the good old world, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but to openly declare a violator would have been a political suicide for a small person.
The protest of the millions-member trade unions of a few tens of thousands of people does not take much time, but it gives reason to think.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, the values have changed
From the perspective of the interest of the Ay movement’s activities, the government’s fierce decisions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll on their own weight for years, now the unions finally get to the issue, i.e. to defend the rights of the worker, visible and properly.
The government may thus be willing to strengthen the role of the ay movement, when membership in the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever you think about the actions of the organizations, it is foolish that the Friday demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has declined for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment continues to rise.
These things would force everyone’s minds.
University of Lappeenranta tough savings plan: aim for savings of 8.5 million, staff will be cut by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is launching a savings course aimed at reducing costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start full-staff negotiations with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In fact, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
In addition, two million euros will be saved.
The backdrop of the NPT negotiations is the 2016 budget, which predicts an actual deficit of 8.5 million.
This also affects the government’s budget cuts.
In this financial year, the university makes approximately 2.6 million in deficit earnings.
The costs will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding received from the ministry will be reduced by 2 million and the other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university’s total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10 percent of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the decrease in corporate financing on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with the confidants will begin next week and will last six weeks as stipulated by the law.
Onnibus wants Finnish railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, told YLE that the company is also aiming for rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, Souter says.
The railway sector will be gradually opened to competition.
The first is the capital region’s nearby traffic in the years 2017-2018.
After the long distance, there is nearby transportation.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the plans of Onnibus are welcomed.
Of other international companies, their interest in rail transport has been by at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank has to decide on interest rates
The rest of the world will follow as the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
When Reuters surveyed 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, since seven years have passed since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less pink global outlook.
It has warned the markets that they should be ready to raise, but the signs indicate they also believe the odds are against the raise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter sends apology message
After shooting her girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting her colleague later on the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying she was “sorry” for the first murder and hoped “that it could be cancelled,” authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the emergency number around ten in the morning.
On Monday, he said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said he “killed his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “does not bother anyone” but is probably shocked.
The police asked the man for his name, but he did not say it.
Lamb did not give an explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss was found and a message written by 45-year-old Lamb read: “I’m so sorry I hope I can cancel it.
I loved Amya and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before eventually killing himself late on Monday as police surrounded him.
William LaForge, the university’s rector, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that “obviously there was something in Lamb’s mind.”
Authorities said on Tuesday that despite Monday’s allegations that Lamb believed Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, there was “never any information or evidence” of any “triadrama.”
Shawn O’Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as a “good person.”
The couple separated 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is “shocked.”
O’Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were “at once best friends.”
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home on the web. According to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“He always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that “he won’t go to jail.”
When police reached Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb debated on education at Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a resume found on the university’s website.
The stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had a hard time in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumors say he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really requires taxes.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been out for two months.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender has been out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno’s careless tackling 15 minutes after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into PSV’s area.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the pitch and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double fracture in his leg and is now in the hospital.”
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible.The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays brilliantly, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least half a year and he doesn’t play in the block stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got either a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian reporter was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you for all your messages, words aren’t enough to say how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I’ll come back stronger.”
Manchester United suffer from Luke Shaw's case and lose to PSV
The English defense team will have an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship in France next June.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: “It’s a really bad injury.”
If a player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
The goal of our players is never to hurt an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg when he played for the Mexican team against the Netherlands against Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“Moreno takes this seriously because the intention is not to hurt an opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I did not see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see Luke’s tail.
Moreno told SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel terrible about this, I’m so sorry.”
PSV’s Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows more about Lorax.
Every parent soon learns one thing: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long before he learns it almost from the outside.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When a holiday child care service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’s The Lorax book, a environmental-friendly story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a post posted on the SuperCamps website and continues: “Funny, moving, creative and containing a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always feels like there is a picture or message we haven’t seen before.”
All this is true, but the next piece, in which Cameron presumably describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which new characters and details were added to fill a rather short original text.
“In the walled town of Tarville, where all nature has disappeared and even air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey’s desire to see the real tree,” the text says and describes a love story not written by Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sounds locally as if it was taken from the plot summary of the Lorax film found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: “In the inner town of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of his dreams’ girl Audrey.”
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. There, a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, tree-cutting and needless Kerskanen, not caring about the short, mushroom creature Lorax, who named the story and “speaks for the trees.”
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the text probably came from the office of Cameron's electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on the matter at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of staying aside from the English team, but it was still a tough place
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tournament, I don’t think it’s likely that the last 3-0 series loss will be repeated.
I’t exclude any winnings from the bills.
The side of Alastair Cook may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it involves good rotators and the team’s mindset is strong: they don’t have scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is evolving in his spin-offs and Adil Rashid is an offensive option, although he is an unknown player at this level.
Adam Lyth dropped from England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged by their outcomes.
For example, there was no uncertainty about the choice of Joe Root before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was himself responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
English head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he didn’t perform as well as he could, and that doesn’t surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a striker gets to leave a trace.
Lyth was selected to the national team seven times, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton was allowed to play both at home and abroad.
The only subject of complaint is that the English chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top condition, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and there’s a striker I admire.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but that depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There’s been a bullshit of the idea of Moen in the kick-off next to Cook, giving an extra feed on the field but holding four fast, and I’m not against that.
I don’t understand why the striker couldn’t be hit there, and this left-handed man has already proved to be a pretty cricket player.
Moe didn’t necessarily do his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he’s three for them and there’s little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games on the first drop before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari is coming to the team as a substitute, and, despite the little I’ve been dealing with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unadulterated statistics – hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 – and think it’s gambling, but there aren’t too many inputs available and voters chose the young.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan striker Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the most comfortable guys in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience, as he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball Games, bringing with him both energy and a ruthless glare.
I’ve always thought he was born to play international cricket, whether it’s playing or training, and he has the same intelligence to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting in a one-day break, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I don't have any problem with this at all.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the selected do not make timetables.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on a light basis.
Those in favour of Brexit may win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron’s semi-voluntary re-negotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing ever-increasing problems, even without taking into account even Jeremy’s heartfelt “Is it yes or not?” election by Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or the union’s central organization’s anger at Europe on Tuesday.
They also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A fellow European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is so deeply in various crises that not all of them are its own fault, some member states are tired of Britain’s self-centered agenda, full of disagreement-making concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these states mostly don’t want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the central trade union organization decided that it would not want them either if they undermine social protection.
We might even call it the selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument with or without a local eye-catcher, and then come home saying they are winning supporters for reforms.
It is all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look from the outside to the inside of Britain’s EU tent – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says from Berlin – suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don’t care we’re left then we leave.
Germany’s cautious and moderate chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it collapses in the same way that happened to the too long delayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Francois Hollande will be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He is also a disappearing force.
Poland could soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the selfie Brits, when their energy would rather be devoted to preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom – they do not want that too because of their own similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some such ministers may even deliberately plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
“The re-exit negotiations were an arranged matter” and “the re-exit negotiations were of no significance to Britain.”
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptical the monopolists of the press are, what they were not at the time of the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They may bluntly remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing “On EU Direct Bananas” as a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
Among them were a massive group of tax evaders, foreigners who hacked their phones, and individuals whose names are located elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but realized that if you’re in a cage with a lustful gorilla, you’ll have to give up bananas because of the hassle, unless you want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later on for dinner.
In fact, Mr. Miliband was more blair than Mr. Blair himself when it comes to opposing Cameron’s push for re-negotiation, namely, Mr. Bair had admitted to the principle behind the EU’s rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Mr. Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly knocked me on the back at Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he has no more time to waste on me), would seem to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock’s 1980s boycotted Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to stay in touch with the media.Not with me, but undoubtedly with Andrew Marry, whom Corbyn left on the BBC sofa on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position in Europe is, beautifully speaking, evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed Europe.
Well, most of the people outside of the UK Independence Party’s military enthusiasm, as well as the Conservative Party’s most ferocious nationalists, can stand behind this opinion.
Hilary “Benn, but not a Benn fan” Benn said this on both radio and television this week, as her inner patrol would have wanted to admit that Corbyn’s choice to appoint the shadowy John McDonnell as the shadow government’s finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father stumbled on television trying to be disloyal to his Labour Party government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary’s spots were more attractive.
But the struggle for staying with “anywhere in the situation” – Benn’s statement – wasn’t what McDonnell said, and not all that Corbyn told leaders and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), communication discipline is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in the twilight of social media, which is a favorable grooming platform for paranoids and fraudsters.
As McDonnell has said, it’s just fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep Labour’s support for the referendum campaign obvious.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s basic circular on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited-regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult discussion among leftist thinkers, for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in the doctrinal struggle.
As for his ambiguity with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to surrender), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste their political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain, when it can be completely useless?
The U.S. has already been somewhat disappointed by Britain’s weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the opening of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize Public Health England's E-cigarette rating
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency’s claim that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than traditional cigarettes originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE released this “milestone” report last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
However, several researchers have questioned the durability of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet last month published a main article that attacked the PHE’s chief executive’s decision on “an exceptionally humorous basis.”
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ have questioned whether the claims were “built on rock or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The primary principle of public health is that practices should be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say that the public will expect that the PHE’s claim “according to the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes” will be based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one of 12 people’s meetings that developed a multi-criterion decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions about the disadvantages associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health mandate in the Sustainability Report, they say.
One out of 12 people at the meeting said they received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding they said they had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The selection criteria for the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes a number of well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also say they have received industry funding in the survey.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco director.
The study produced by the group “massively acknowledges” that there is a lack of “unquestionable evidence regarding the harmful effects of most products and most criteria,” McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that “so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims made in the BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Half of people who smoke in their lifetime die from addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and what it doesn’t look like, especially as there is so much public unconsciousness about the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence—that is, even if e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harm is only a fraction of the harm of traditional tobacco—we fulfill our national responsibility.
BBC should quit EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and that commercial competitors would “give anything” from hits like this soap series on Albert Square.
Johnson said license fees should only be used to make programs that other UK broadcasters don’t do.
He criticized the BBC for putting public-service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, in difficult broadcast times against its most viewed competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the company wanted more collaboration with other organizations, Johnson said he tried Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programs that would be suitable for clearly non-subsidized competitors," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his study on the future of the BBC.
If the license fee is held - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this medium or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programs that others don't do and produce.
The Voice is being broadcast at the most important time of the day, as it is aimed at collecting as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded even without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, undeniably inside the house implemented.
Frankly, other channels would give anything about it.
I don’t understand what public service is about.
I don’t think it would weaken the BBC at all.”
Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC is committing the hunt for viewers “because of the goals of the people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to get long-term support.”
His comments on BBC’s most popular series are similar to those of former Sky director Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public service programs "go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibility and can then, in defense of £4 billion in license fees, hypocritically say, 'Of course, we're doing all these unknown programs that no one is watching.'"
They put them on a broadcast spot where nobody will ever come to watch them.
Regarding the allowance fee, Johnson told the committee: “I’m challenging you to look for a more regressive system of who gets the most.
Of course you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is worth a lot, but I don’t know if that’s true for those people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money because they don’t spend a lot on the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate Reith’s role in “informing, educating and entertaining.”
He said that only a small portion of the BBC’s production is now classified as education – he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio – and that it should take the model of Australian and Canadian broadcasting and change the task to the form of “informing, educating and entertaining”.
Regarding partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events like the Proms, which he says are shown on television only a few times, and alliance with commercial companies so that they can all be watched online.
“Sound Genetics” allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the seedlings change direction as soon as a sound pulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to be controlled by sound wave outbreaks.
The small seedlings change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by turning on genetically modified nerve cells with membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that worms demonstrate the functionality of a new method, called sound genetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart, and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are conducted to the human brain to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Sculptures normally did not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopically small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles strengthened ultrasound waves, which then passed into the worms.
Enhanced ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures that are present in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate cells attached to them, according to a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasound-controlled splinters, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their nerve cells contained TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani applied ultrasound to modified worms, micro-bubbles reinforced sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they turn on modified nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that using sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which has to be sent along the optical fiber to the desired spot within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unobstructed, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
“We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it may be possible to get targeted human nerve cells to temporarily respond to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture tools - delivered to your home!
Advertising may shame the British arms trade
Watch the video from Amnesty International.
Terrible killing machines.
Destroyed pedestrian cars.
The bombs!
As well as electrical bending pumps that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and graphic language of the cartoons leave no doubt that this ad at the world’s largest trade fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to trade weapons to repressive governments at a celebration at the Defence and Security Equipment International’s ExCeL Center in the London shipyard.
DSEI: Autoritarian Regimes Arriving in London
With the separate campaign, many posters appeared on bus stops and in the subway, which require a closer look at them.
“Important information, Will you travel on the DLR route on September 15-18,?” is asked together using the London Underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into an image of a tank.
This September, a bunch of weapons dealers arrive on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the raids.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were exhibited at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Cruel Designs).
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using “Ad Space Hack Packs” packages. This is a package of six pounds of six-point keys, which according to the collective “accesses a third of the entire planet’s bus stops advertising space.”
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized “postcards vandalism.”
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator at Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to bring political work to audiences outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists on the resistance fronts when they have realized that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to impact society.
Another anti-weapons trade poster greeting workers on the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed over 100,000 times over the last 24 hours via Facebook. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and a graphic designer and background designer also worked for free.
Matt Leverin, VCCP’s creative director, noticed that station shows were not advertised at all – and there was also an empty spot on ExCeL’s calendar at the time – and thought, “Give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertisement of a dark corporation, but “it was more stopping to emphasize the matter with bright colors and animation.”
“They have done fantastic work in helping us raise questions about illegal torture tools sold at trade fairs,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
Now the UK government must take action to ensure that torture tools are not illegally sold near our own homes.
Per the most creative art associated with stationary fairs comes from inside ExCeL, as exhibitors market fantastically decorated products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that it had received an order from the U.S. Army for an AT4CS RS launch from the shoulder.
This includes a “unique pipe-in-pumping shell that has excellent effects behind the armor inside the object.”
Whatever it does, it is not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Housing
It’s been 11 years since I moved to a student residence at the age of 19 when I didn’t know about it. At that time I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now can I remember the violent smiles of people I annoyed – and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Much of what I’ve learned can be summarized in eight simple rules.
Moving into a home can be anything from nervous to frightening.
It’s tempting to talk: tell me where you’re from, if you liked the season and where, what you think of Corbyn, and why “I don’t really love or hate Marmite because really it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA find me in my room.”
Take a breath.
And also help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not those you don’t want to talk to even if your eyelids are on fire and they share the shutters.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often transformed into cocktail invitations, film festivals and public spots, but they are also the places where people dress up and repair their underwear.
Related: Don’t even imagine starting college while you’re in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dorms form a culture of wandering from room to room that is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendship.
It can mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, “I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when your fellow student is tired of socializing – and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
When it came to talk: knock.
One guy in my student residence was of the opinion that if the door was not locked, he would have been invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through craving.
Since you start college at the peak of the bakery trend, knocking people on the doors with a chocolate plate and presenting yourself seems to some extent less strange, less “welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions” from a 50-year-old.
Providing self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your partner will feel obliged to talk, and they may associate your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
It depends on whether you know how to cook.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat foods are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Theft of food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking someone’s chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Ask and check the owner of the milk.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stories, it’s annoying and you get my sympathy – but try to treat it more adultly than my roommate who mixed the detergent with his milk to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You shouldn’t be mocked so that people don’t get to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you’re like that proverbial sting that sounds like a boiler.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music quieter because it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally silenced at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before putting her own music on, locked her door and went for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move to the same apartment with you?
Or vice versa,’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you consider a housing partner to be your future spouse, stick together, break up, and then see him every day and possibly lose all your common friends to him.
Sure, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot housing companion isn’t really your future spouse, you might even try to talk about the meaning of your bottom.
In that joyful moment when you find that someone has left their keys to their unlocked room, the line between bullying and bullying is thinner than it seems.

A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kite - a house planned as a reception center was shattered in Salò
A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students was carried out on Saturday morning in Kite, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation of minors asylum-seekers, but the sleeping rooms of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period of time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical Folk University of Kite.
The windows and walls of the university’s accommodation premises were stamped with racist signs, such as bars, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodation premises, says the Eastern Finland police.
According to Luukkainen, who serves as a responsibility teacher for the youth community guarantee education at the University of Kansas, an estimated 10 people were in the building at the time of the attack.
“There was a weekend and adults were free to move, so some could be elsewhere,” Luukkainen says.
The university hosts people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as young asylum seekers who have just arrived.
Everyone in the building has an A-status.
Some are studying in adult primary school, some are in professional studies and some are studying Finnish,” Luukkainen says.
A status is a permanent residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police are investigating the incident as a violation of home peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held for the students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There was no panic here, and no one wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time that something like this happens,” Luukkainen says.
According to him, the rubbish has already been cleared from the walls.
The perpetrators are suspected of being at least three men and they were in a light car.
I think this is the main pitch of the youth weekend after this topic has now been on the surface.
There’s nothing more serious than that,” he said.
There is also a hospital in Salou, where a reception center is planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was on MTV’s website on Tuesday.
The walls of the hospital were painted with the inscription "You are not welcome".
A criminal report has been filed to the police.
Accuracy 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state shuts down the Y-train to Karja - passengers in their clutches, "completely idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raaseborg will stop operating in March.
The news annoyed passengers on the start of the train at the main railway station in Helsinki.
In particular, the downturn hits the blessed people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It’s very idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and those who are working need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
It can’t depend on anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in a video interview with HSTV that he will come to the capital by a tractor.
In other parts of the country there are also changes in trains.
The H and R trains on the main line will be merged into a new R line.
The Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusul stays out of service.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced the details on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services for the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the end of the year and there will be closed routes across the country.
The new four-year contract, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be approved by the Monetary Affairs Committee later.
Siuntian Bengtström considers that the state train cutting machine is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them very systematically.
Then comes regret.
The Y train is also used by non-Raseborans and Blessed people because it is fast and passes several stations.
Spanish woman Annina Pöyry was upset by the fate of those travelling beyond the city area by train.
"It's specifically unfortunate for those who have to re-planning their trip," he said while hurting on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There will probably be a new train connection to the Rantara, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Seudun Traffic (HSL) area, i.e. it will take you to Kirkkonum.
This leads to additional costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now exploring the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
Costs cannot be estimated accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million for the Y-train in a year, the ministry of course much more than this.
The R line leaves two stations in between.
On the other hand, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakalli is doubling.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes are closed across the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Route Pieksämäki-Joensuu will be abbreviated to the Route Pieksämäki-Varkaju.
Trains are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys are made per year, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately 27.5 million euros per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book "Actuality of Capital": "Marx is worth studying"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes the former chairman of the SKP, Yrjö Hakanen, in the book Marx’s Capital’s Actuality, published today.
“He is being taken more seriously now than he has been in a long time,” Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s assessments of the development, internationalization and increasing penetration of capitalist economy into all spheres of life, of the concentration of capital, and of the growing role of money capital and fictional capital have proved astonishingly far-reaching.
Among the authors of the book based on the Capital seminars organized by Hakasen is also Aalto University professor, renowned economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is current “now and forever.”
Isn’t the former director of the Institute for Economic Research and the Delegation for Economic Affairs, however, a Marxist?
At least not.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx to be a contemporary economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences have differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary expert.
“The common belief is that the history of ideas tells about the false opinions of the dead men,” Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went terribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
“More relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Now we are again discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be an inspiration for those who want to understand the big picture, a world that is changing as a result of a technological revolution," Korkman analyses.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is not helpful.
He believes that capitalism is a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
However, Marx believes that Korkman should be examined.
“In the 1970s Marx could not read,” says Korkman.
“The Maoists and Trotskyists and the other factions hated capitalism all, but even more one another.”
Today, the discussion is more diverse, and even Marx can be approached without the ideological and political burden of the years back.
“Every social scientist should get acquainted with Marx’s world of thought – as with other classics,” Korkman says.
UN calls for war crimes in Sri Lanka
The United Nations is calling for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the civil war in Sri Lanka.
The United Nations report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 was released on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the Tamil rebels for war crimes.
The civil war in Sri Lanka has killed at least 100,000 people.
The exact number of victims is not known.
Particularly the massive attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The report blames the Sri Lankan armed forces for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, with men as likely as women to be victims.
According to the report, the rebels are responsible for forcing outsiders and children to become fighters.
Both parties are accused of the murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In English yo-exam, social media was punctuated
In the autumn student writings there was a long foreign language turn on Wednesday, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 people tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a material even on social media.
From our own experience, we had to think about whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250-word writing in English could be directed to the editor of the online newspaper’s advisory board.
It was called Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to Finnish Leelia's sleeping chair.
He was asked to advise how parents should look at things from a younger perspective as well.
There were four subjects, one of which was to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," said Mia Lybeck, an English lecturer at the Swedish-language high school in Borgonya.
This is a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth point was very good for Lybeck.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we have been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says, evaluating the entire exam as "pretty normal."
In the Finnish – or Swedish – English test, questions were answered about texts that covered, for example, the adaptation of the summer campsite to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some length was also written in Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn tests will continue on Friday, when the second domestic test, Sweden or Finland, will be held.
In high schools, the exam is held normally, i.e. the demonstration of the employees does not affect it.
The Student Examination Board urges the examiners to find suitable connections in time so that they can get to the examination.
Additional time may also be granted if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu theft with gun threat
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in the city district of Oulu.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and was covered with a commandopop.
He is a normal man and is about 30 years old.
Police said the man threatened the staff with a gun and seized a small sum of money.
This is being investigated as a robbery.
Police are preparing for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki – support parties from elsewhere in Finland
A protest against the government’s cuts will block down central Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary data, tens of thousands of people are expected to attend.
The members of the Federation, Akava and STTK will meet at the Railway at 11 a.m.
Police are also expected to participate in the demonstration.
The task of the police officers at work is not only to handle alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the running of the giant demonstration.
The roads leading to the railway line will be closed for motor vehicles for about 9:30-14 hours.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off from the point of the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction from the Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, High Commissioner Seppo Kujala?
At least for now it seems to be enough.
I am not talking about police work.
As a result of the protests, support groups from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki.
The exact numbers are not revealed by the police.
“Something is coming, but generally we can do it on our own,” Kujala says.
The police are advising to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jamming extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the core center.
Traffic stops are expected from early morning.
With the protesters coming from other parts of Finland, many buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed on the railway.
The buses are very far away.
At the end of the journey, we have to walk to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The protest also stopped public transportation in Helsinki.
From a police perspective, there is a positive side to this.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large crowd gatherings, is now partly dealing with itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy could arrive in Helsinki.
Police are expecting the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
There are ordinary unemployed people – ordinary citizens.
The Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
There will also be local demonstrations across Finland on Friday.
Friday’s demonstration is in many ways exceptional – do you remember those strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organized by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good benchmark for this in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiäinen, professor of sociology at Jyväskylä University.
It is not surprising that the AI movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise hands in front of the government, Siisiäinen said.
A very right-wing government has struck the core points of the Finnish corporatism tradition – and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
There is a lack of government contracts in the law.
Here are a lot of features that the ay movement is actually trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for the Friday demonstrations.
New now is the sharp division that the demonstration creates among the crowd that the ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland demonstrated in the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If a benchmark is sought for the Friday demonstration, it could be a giant unemployment demonstration, Murrostorstai, held in 1993, Siisiäinen says.
In the midst of the deepest downturn, Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (central) government is computing from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the employers' organizations had never been so bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the ay movement is even worse than it was in Murrostorstai’s time.
Furthermore, there is now a very bourgeois government in Finland, Siisiäinen says.
The current coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Basic Finns.
There were certain elements of the old working-class movement at the time of the Jytky.
Thousands of protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly close kindergartens and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the unshared support of the employees, it may become the highest in years.
Over the past few years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They are wide.
Traditionally, the protests of the Ay movement in Finland have been quite peaceful - although the practices have been tightened in recent years.
Traditionally, in the Finnish demonstration, conflict is avoided and law is obeyed.
The protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisiäinen says.
The late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and police prepared to catch pork.
The firefighters strike lasted for three months.
There were also strikes among pilots and flight managers.
Do you remember these strikes and protests?
Electricity and Metal Industries in the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal workers participated in the strike.
The strike was suspended on the proposal of the conciliation committee after a seven-week strike.
The employees received a 16% salary increase.
In the spring of 1977, a power outage lasted for 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Crashed in 1993
On November 4, 1993, around 20,000 people, many of whom were unemployed, gathered in front of the House of Representatives to demonstrate in favour of the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The fire strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strikes of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, farmers protested against the EU.
“Siberia teaches, the EU stops,” was one of the slogans.
The farmers have taken a ton of snow.
The European Union summit in Helsinki in 1999 also prompted farmers to protest and burn strawberries in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they were on strike was in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass displacement of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass displacement ultimately accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors Strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of local health centers and hospital doctors lasted for five months and sparked a lively debate about how strikes could jeopardize patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students in 2013
Around 5,000 students marched for study support from the Senate Tower to the parliamentary house in Helsinki in 2013.
Central crime police investigate the background of a Finnish truck filled with refugees for Austrian police
Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out the backgrounds of a refugee cargo registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known whether the truck was on its way to Finland.
Everyone in the car was in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility is on the scene in Austria, said Tero Haapala, the High Commissioner of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in a truck in Austria suffered more fatalities.
All 71 passengers on board died of suffocation.
According to the Austrian broadcaster Yleisradio, the truck belongs to a Finnish company.
The company is engaged in, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a man of foreign descent, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqis have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
A captain who beat refugees, a former drug courier and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A wealthy king of smugglers, a violent boatkeeper, a style-conscious missionary and a good taxi driver.
For example, such people are engaged in human smuggling into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their “customers”, and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they introduce the tricks of human trafficking, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of the business.
HS presents five of them.
Immediately remove them from you.
The Kerkenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer holiday.
Due to their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the journey to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is approximately 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
That’s what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre-long cotton boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him across Tunisia.
Guests come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
The situation then calmed down until the refugee crisis broke up again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir houses them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers just stay alive.
Accommodation costs around 75 euros per night, and if the customer gets out of money, it’s their problem.
We go to the water at midnight with the lights turned off.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes sailing is harsh, and in 20-meter-high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
The ship is disembarked in half an hour and Emir is on the way back.
Emily wants him to be afraid.
That’s why he beat his clients and at least claims to be killing the whistleblowers.
He tells the book that when the police once struck him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
“I met clients one by one from the neck and threw them over the edge,” Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the south of the Sahara.
He said his countrymen should be abused by this.
I think you’ll get rid of them right away.
They must immediately be shown who rules here.
Ordinary taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogova, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the start engine is pulling its last and still it has seen its best days.
For Goran’s customers, however, the most important thing is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mostly allowed to families.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men traveling without their families are housed in tents, barracks and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for some reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some are also housed in private houses, but it is a public secret.
Among Foresters, Goran finds the majority of its customers.
These are often exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in hard-to-pass terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
Eventually arriving in Bogota, a major human trafficking hub, people are fatigued.
The Goran Cytians are mainly Syrians, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
“They say their thing once and that’s enough,” Goran praises.
He says the Africans are trying to catch up.
Goran does not like that.
The idiot goes all the way.
First, you agree to the price, for example, 300 euros, then they drop it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind man.
Money does not interest me.
I just do my job and help people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person to the Hungarian border.
The distance is three hundred kilometers, most comfortably by motorway.
It is said to be three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
This is not a large sum for a smuggler, but it is a fairly comfortable annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to carry migrants closer than 12 kilometers to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care about it: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his Cytes a mile away from the border.
He then points his clients in the right direction and walks away.
The work of mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called Missionary, and it’s not just a nickname.
He actually has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, which hosts a large number of Congolese refugees, and a small center that helps Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He does the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber stripe of the white jerseys glimps elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his off-road car and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The client will first call one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money wisely and stumbling among the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they come from, for example, war zones in North Kivu, and that they have been forced to flee violence from their homes.
Often this is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the client.
The old identity card will be removed and a new one will be replaced.
This is accompanied by the Missionary’s contacts with Ugandan police.
The client is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, and finally to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself came to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about one hundred euros, handling documents to a humanitarian organization about 150, and the process of migration, for example, to one of the European countries 4 500-7 000 euros.
Foil and ice
Tom is a beginner smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman journeys on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks heading to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan taxi driver living in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are involved in a human trafficking business.
At night, Tom and a taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They drive the A26 motorway and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That’s what Tom doesn’t want, he’s been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
When a taxi stops, Tom and his clients run across the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck – you have to make sure it’s on the way to England, not even to the Netherlands, for example – and cuts the safety curtain on the protective cover.
It must be done quietly so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is in the run, but then the desire is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in an aluminum foil, similar to the one wrapped around a fried potato or oven in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from detecting the hiding person.
Some people use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves, hoping that he won’t be able to catch up with the riders before he arrives in Britain.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human traffickers in the world.
He has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, controlling maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly to Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands money only when he arrives.
One of the new methods is luxury shipping scams: Turkish ports are allegedly rented fun boats to take U.S. or European families on a comfortable few-day tourist tour.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of 5,000 to 7,000 euros first from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until the time comes for them to leave.
People are locked in minibuses and driven somewhere toward the coast.
They are told to hide amongst the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, it is necessary to get on board quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden under the deck all the time.
The naval guard can only observe how deep the ship was swimming, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and beverages are given, but the less the travellers exfoliate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately €53,000 for one luxury boat trip after expenses.
He does not do the practical things himself, but hired captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller agents to do the work for themselves.
During the summer season, transports are organized at least hundreds and Küçük earns millions.
He is believed to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company and more than a hundred apartments he rents through cover companies.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 simultaneously with a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical businessman.
After that, he apparently disappeared.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The book Death Travel Agency will appear this week, not next week.
American Olympic runner in a book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three-time Olympic runner Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells the story of ending her career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He entered the competition in top form and ran in the second best time.
In the end, he fell in panic.
He rushed to the top at the beginning and defended his leadership position with a ground run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his powers were exhausted.
He crashed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
But I forced myself to go beyond the goal line, says Favor Hamilton in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strangers.
She also promised her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton’s tax was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent his money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he wanted the same adrenaline he had received when competing in sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he had bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed in late 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games of Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world recorded top at 1500 meters at 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympics final.
The world champion rejoiced when the federation disciplined the Norwegian skiing squad: "Straight"
Norwegian skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of suitability, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian skiing federation have twisted over the entire summer and autumn, like last year, on a sports contract.
Although the federation has offered Northug a better contract than other athletes, it has not been enough for the multi-time world champion and Olympic winner.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian ski federation decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming season's World Cup.
The award was awarded to double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was delighted that the union put the skyscraper on track.
“Thank you for pointing the backbone,” Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the federation's sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the season's national team so he could advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was delighted to represent a federation that also cares about future generations and does not give one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know it because I’ve been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug announced on Tuesday that he would like to play in Norway’s colours next season at the World Cup as well as at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen has won six World Cup medals, two of them gold.
He was a member of the team that won the Message Gold last winter in Falun.
Translators’ Day will also be celebrated in the North
On the day of the competition, on September 25th, we will organize trips in various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Shield of the Bake Translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high level of food industry expertise and lower the threshold for entering a restaurant, as well as raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants have concentrated in the capital region, but top-quality restaurants inspected and rated by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is a demonstration of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of racing restaurants and the organization.
In the northern part of the country, the day will be held in Vaasa restaurant in Fondis and Kantarelli.
The old town restaurant participates in the race.
The event has also received considerable attention internationally.
The event was decided to become one of the organization’s most important international events, which will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country.
Kauhajoki-magazine: A case for the establishment of a terrible reception center for the Chancellor of Justice
The Migration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-garde force currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure of the crisis period is still permanently located in the area, which is in the use of the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland Erillisverkot Oy.
According to the private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Flight Military School, the impact of which has also not been investigated during the preparation of the reception center, the newspaper writes.
In the case, it is stated that for the Kauhawa airport, negotiations have been held over the past two years on the organization of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with, among other things, Minister of Defense Jussi Niinistön (PS) and the Chancellor-in-Chief of the Ministry of Defense Arto Rädy.
A private person declares to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of principled opposition to the reception center, but that the planned location in the former reserve area is wrong.
The city council dealt with the case on the reception center last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting with the presidents of all parliamentary parties in his office residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, concerns about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He believes it is worthwhile that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss fundamental issues in a confidential manner.
Especially in these times when we are facing great challenges.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, could also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
This is an opportunity for the development of dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia can, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further tensions on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also discussed.
The government did not take a stand on the labour market.
Finnair cancelled 16 domestic flights on Friday
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia says that the operations of the airports are aimed at handling during the work-stay with primary force.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checks and other service points.
Protesters shut down streets in central Helsinki
On Friday, the protests will shut down the streets of the city centre.
Police say that the streets leading to the Railway will be closed for cars around 9:30-14.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars are not allowed in the direction of the Railway Station.
From Union Street in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Union Street in the circle of Kaisaniemi.
The closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and railway protest on Friday
Metro and tram drivers will participate in Friday’s demonstration from the start of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The railway and subway staff association told STT this evening.
The majority of openings will be closed for two hours, including posts closed.
Friday’s protests also disrupted the post office.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, in the distribution of daily mail.
Most post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross blood transfers will be handled despite the strike.
Food transportation, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples will also be sought to be handled.
Information on services can be obtained from the Post’s website.
The majority of Finnish Alkoos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The trade union in the service sector, Pam, has ordered its employees to suspend work between 11 a.m. and 13 a.m.
Pam has also urged retailers to participate in trade unions’ demonstrations.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanom that the stores are aimed at keeping open if necessary.
According to the company, there is no information about the closure of the individual stores.
Helsinki is partially closed
Helsinki kindergartens will not be fully operational on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to the demonstration of trade associations, daycare may be concentrated in certain kindergartens, and club activities in kindergartens and play parks will not be organized.
Day-to-day kindergartens and groups of children with developmental disabilities and multi-disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for developmental disabilities and autistic schoolchildren are organized normally.
The Ministry of Education promises to announce further changes tomorrow.
Media analysts take a big risk
According to Sipilė, a variety of channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the prime minister’s television and radio speeches are repeated.
In the future, speeches will not necessarily always be broadcast on YLE channels.
If there are other channels, we will see.
I’m going to use this channel tonight, he said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio to speak to the citizens.
This set of facts, which we are talking about now, is quite complicated and requires a longer reasoning.
That’s why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also see it in the arena.
The dog takes a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television speech does not speak of a more general turn of the government inside.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define the public debate more strictly into their own hands and refuse to ask questions about the public debate? thinks Anu Koivunen, a professor at the University of Stockholm.
It comes to mind the recent comment of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these things are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is angry at Sipilän’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn’t react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in a democracy.
It is the responsibility of the media representatives to strive to ensure that politicians’ agendas are not taken as given.
I think television is a big risk.
The speaker should bring something new and special to the table in his speech, so that the exceptionally high expectations set on the speech can be met.
Is there anything more available today that we have already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old in the license, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In general, take this risk in the sense that it is not a particular situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be labeled as a message for politicians or the parliament and the government, which is not in accordance with YLE’s interests or the general line.
A wise veto
In Sipilö’s upcoming speech, what the prime minister will not say is also important, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, we have to look closely at what is missing and what is not, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
According to Kuti, the TV speech is a clever appeal from Sipil, because in this way he can express his own views without a whisper.
This gives the message a broad audience without a journalistic filter, unlike in a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
He passes the media and speaks directly to the public.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
According to Kutik, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - swelling sweat, shaking hands.
He compares the Sipil to the father figure, who now tells the people what to do.
If you know how to perform well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government informed about something, because it is as if a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what President Barack Obama and his colleagues regularly do.
Really exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
It hasn’t happened in decades that the Prime Minister has spoken directly to the people.
Exceptional times require exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks the prime minister thus wants to get the Finns to sympathize with the extortion ahead.
On Friday, workers organized a strike against the government’s actions.
Leftist chairman Paavo Arhinmäki says on Twitter that Sipilä could hold his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the prime minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (SD) once again announces that he is challenging Sipilä’s dialogue.
No time for monologues.
Half a year from the election.
You can’t hide it indefinitely, Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-Year-Old Boy Found Escaped in Tokyo
The boy was well at the time of his arrival.
The boy’s father has updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department is also confirming the matter to Iltalehd.
The boy went out to play at four in the afternoon.
Later that night, he was no longer contacted.
I would like to thank all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared close to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed by youth's violent deception: You'll generate hatred
Kurdish-based freelance player Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook in which he appealed especially to young people of immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a heavy speech against the street struggles of young people.
Born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani said she received a message asking her to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos that show young people struggling with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed with the youth’s wildness.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The boys kick the people on the ground, sit on the other side and strike without thinking about the consequences of what happens when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
Difficult to defend
Some of the young people on the video are immigrants.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, video of the fighting has been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
In other words, you are fighting on the street.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turkish Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani reminds that there are websites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very severe.
A little difficult, guys, no longer to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be a long time here.
That’s a different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their relatives.
If they ever face someone’s racism, you can blame yourself.
Think a few times before you get involved.
Amirkhani says that violent activity contributes to racism.
You’re causing a kind of hatred that I don’t like.
You have things pretty badly and you will not improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
FAK puts its stance on savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, tweeted on Monday that the wage-taker organization will consider its position on the alternative savings plan proposed by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK said it would present its own proposal to the government to the 5 percent productivity reduction demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilän.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the government will approve the proposal if the FAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest wage-taker organization FAK to soften its previous position.
Chairman Lauri Lyly commented on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the FF Working Committee will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lilly, the FAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market" and that instead of compulsory laws, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly reminds that the proposal of the government of Prime Minister Sipilä for a social agreement did not favor the FAK.
Sipilä previously interrupted negotiations on a social agreement after the FCA refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity loss.
Comments: The protest threatens to run out - "It feels a bit weird to throw a thumb"
It feels a little strange to have a tree fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmospheres vary widely in the salary camp.
Should the government be dismissed or agree with it?
On Monday, the federal leaders sparked holy hatred against the Republican government.
The whole country was threatened.
It also spread to the Aquarius.
The teachers’ trade union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, the Chairman of the staff center organization STTK Antti Palola (sd) made a conciliatory appearance.
He said he was in contact with the government and prepared an alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central) as a 5% productivity loss.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder (kok) promptly announced that his agreement paper was already ready.
In the beginning there was no office.
President Lauri Lylyn (SD) has had difficulty agreeing when federal leaders just ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the FIS Working Committee will meet next Monday to address the situation and that the FIS will look for solutions to “open the labour market.”
In order for a joint proposal of the wage-earners to arise, the FIS should be inclined to accept a productivity reduction of 5 percent as its goal.
It’s no wonder that the Palolan STTK has a good relationship with the Sipilä government.
Palola’s right hand, Jukka Ihanus, the director responsible for STTK’s social impact, has previously served as a special assistant to Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Mr. Palola also characterizes the fact that the government’s AI expertise has been constantly improving.
Coincidentally or not, but Palola’s departure took a bit of a blow away from the Finnish standers, whose front figure is AKT’s Marko Piirainen (SD).
It feels a bit strange to have a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18:00: Added information about Lilly's comments.
Russia blames Finland as bad host: ‘This must not be repeated’
Russian Duma Chairman Sergei Naryshkin has criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Russian Duma Chairman Sergei Naryshkin said that Mongolia is a better host of the OSCE than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly began, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July solemn meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union’s sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to attend the meeting – a matter that the President had the time to remind reporters.
In our opinion, this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This should not be repeated, Naryshkin stressed, according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin’s criticism was not only directed at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his entry was also blocked.
The sanctions are a political suicide for the EU, Naryshkin said.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation got into trouble, so Naryshkin continued to flatter Finland by praising and praising Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am confident that the Parliamentary General Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results – unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva, the chairman of the meeting in Ulan Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already talked with the Russian delegation.
The lock faces the real playoff hole: "Goals in tight"
Kappara and Lukko continue today in the Hakam Forest on the bull days, when both are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicted that there will be no real paint festivals in the Hakam Forest today.
Yesterday, he went on to win a 3-2.
The rise was masculine, as the silver group last season was at its worst out of two goals losing.
Tuesday was more winning.
Blues, who started the catch with the space, had rounded zero points, and the losses also counted 2-3.
A tough game, goals tight, if any play a similar game as last year, Lukko attacker Janne Lahti predicts settings on the club’s pages.
It has become a playoff nightmare.
In the last two seasons, Kappara has just knocked out the final in the semi-finals.
In both matches, a decisive seventh match was required.
Last season, Lukko drove the series in the fourth game, but Kappara rose alongside and past in the next three.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except for the goalkeepers.
Both of the boys who were arrested yesterday will be arrested today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, while Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Title: A Bad Show in Action
Sporting director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for the head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It is classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
He was a heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a troubled ashes story for Pori.
An unnamed and knife-haired batch advanced to the surprise of all to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was filled with anonymous but stubborn underdogs like Rocky.
There was the White Indian, Porin Mattia and Pele Peltosta.
In the fall games, the players painted their heads red and cut off the Iroquois.
She became a blonde.
A good TV reporter, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
They won the silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Screenwriter Toivola believes that this season’s novel works in the same way as ten years ago.
The man who works as the sporting executive of the Ace has built a patchwork on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have mocked the pigs in the distance like Rocky pigs in the slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparinen are somewhere other than circular play.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the main role is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Iron Horse into Sean Connery.
Iron Rock is just as dumb as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There is no other Rocky in Iron Rock than a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Shark does not include rushing and small skating.
He appreciates a tough game, but it’s a different thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford hit Kill Jere in the head.
He was given 2+10 minutes by the judges, but the man was put in the shower by Rautakallio.
He did not deserve a minute.
We only play those who deserve it.
I do not accept such a game and it does not belong to hockey assault, the fiery Iron Rock rushed to the people after the game.
This season’s team is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen and scouts.
There are practically no best players in the game.
No wonder the head coach has complained about a lack of skills.
How much have you been able to influence the purchases of players, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect the procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather narrow, Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
under the surface.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports bomber.
Men’s contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Ace in the three league games of the season is equal to the number of losses with a goal difference from 1 to 6.
It’t have been worthwhile for Hope to write a follow-up.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Sipe Santapuk
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen will play for the first time under her husband.
Yes, in the movie I represent the mother of my husband’s friend.
Somehow it feels crazy, actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanna's former bassist and director Tuukka Temosen since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but now Olga plays for the first time under the direction of Tuuka.
Olga's role in the movie You Made Us Beautiful, which tells about the early years of Apulanna, is played by drummer Sipe Santapuki's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tries and supports his son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get acquainted with my true example Cirka, the easier it feels to play the role.
He’s a great guy and I’m grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come closer together.
They met, spoke on the phone and communicated.
The circle helped a lot.
We have been through many different corners of their history.
Sirkka is also fortunate to understand that drama is drama and the truth may have to be painted a little.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 1990s, it was very bad and very bad.
There was little chance that someone would really succeed, but Circus had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot about Tuuka’s youth before she started filming.
Parents’ stories are sometimes different.
So, if you’re a 15-year-old teenager, then how much your parents really know what you’re doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukan, who was known as Heinola’s infamous skater.
Olga was a day-to-day and kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could have secretly admired it.
Olga says she has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a large joint project is not scary.
Everything has always gone super well.
The entire production team will now go to Heinola for a month.
However, the couple who live in Iit will often drive home at night because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We will spend a month in Hainan.
They have received us very warmly, only asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive film in Finland
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming begins in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
Iron Sky’s sequel, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland’s most expensive drama film of all time with a budget of €17 million.
The title of the most expensive film in Finland has previously been given to Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The animated Angry Birds movie will be out of the Iron Sky 2, with a budget of more than 100 million euros.
The filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaan, will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and will last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is scheduled to travel to Belgium next week.
The budget is not scary.
I have been very sick!
I’m so casual about the script because I know exactly what kind of film should come out of.
Everyone in the group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It’s great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited and can’t wait to show this movie to the audience, he tells Iltalehd.
The film was originally planned for a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It’s a big budget, but it’s a big stock.
However, the film should cost $100 million, because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything is turned so tight that nothing is loose.
Iron Sky Universe has launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond that will be paid at an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or Cool?
T-shirts are back in the shirt
The fronts of the trendsetters have recently been decorated with large logos.
Until some time ago, fashion-conscious dressers avoided clear and large logos like Crocce.
Advertising for the Huppar or T-shirt brand was seen as a bit of a junkie.
But the times change.
Sport has become a true megatrend in fashion, and so have old, well-known sportswear brands such as Adidas and Nike risen to the wave of coolness.
And as so often before, the boundary between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already right junta, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the fashion style, where trendsetter surprises by favouring the most boring basic clothes as possible as a way to stand out from the mass.
Now, instead of the gray basic college, we put on the web shirt already buried at the bottom of the closet, in front of which the manufacturer’s logo stands.
The larger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, adidas’s recognizable tracks, favorite team t-shirts and the New York Yankees lipstick have also returned to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logo is now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace’s autumn bracelets makes it clear which brand clothes are in question.
Would you like to introduce your logo in your dress?
Russian politician reveals evidence: I wasn’t stuck in a tank lock for hours
The incident is believed to have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, Russian media have circulated colourful allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergencies had to remove a large Zotov from the tank cage for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to deny the information.
He even posted on his own public Facebook page a picture in which he appears to be staring out of the lock of a tank vehicle in a pretty good mood and at least according to those pictures it is not about getting stuck or angry at all.
Full of nonsense.
Let’s start with the fact that I didn’t go into a combat tank, it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went in, looked around and came out peacefully, Zotov told Komosomolskaja Pravda.
“I didn’t get stuck and I didn’t really spend five hours in that position,” he said.
In an interview with the Russian Army television channel, Zotov explained that he admired the new technology of Russia because he himself is a former professional soldier.
So I was interested in what was inside the cars, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the backdoors, he said.
I went to all tanks.
And in the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all strike tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also whispered the journalist who wrote about it as a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in and I went out.
I am tall and rough, but nothing like I was stuck somewhere in a tank did not happen, he told the Russian radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged trapped have been published, despite a total of 50,000 people attending the weapons exhibition in a few days.
The allegation that Zotov was trapped originated from a case on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told that he ran out of the tank cage while trying to get out and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn’t get out of his surface.
Later on, the Bloknot website published a sequel, in which the organizers of the exhibition shared their views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, was simply delayed when he came out.
But in any case he did not sit there for five hours, the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski told Bloknot.
This is my favorite blog post.
The Lassen candlestick of the architects brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) from 1962 looks like it was designed today.
The cube-like steel frame is like a work of art, and that was what it originally was.
The architects are known to melt the shape of the candle for a long time and mathematically accurately.
It was initially presented only to gentlemen's prestigious dinner guests.
Kubus candlesticks are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, whichins the design heritage of the renowned brothers.
The candlesticks are hand-made in Holstebro, Denmark, in versions of eight, four and one candles, in four different colors.
Cubus is available in black, white and in the form of nickel and copper.

The Kittilän mine at Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian mining company, has been leaked.
The process water purified by the gold mine has leaked into the so-called enrichment sand pool.
According to the company, measures have been taken to repair the leak.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
Generally, water is either pumped for reuse as process water or, as permitted, drawn into the environment through the surface drainage field.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leaked water meets the current authorisation conditions.
No other material is discharged into the environment.
The leak was detected on Monday morning during an inspection.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the pool's patio structures.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mining company employs about 600 permanent workers.
IMF warns against excessive cuts
The report released today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization urged Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime compensation and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and for unemployment protection.
Pasi Kuoppamäki, chief economist at Danske Bank, said that we agree on structural reforms, but there are small differences.
The IMF’s assessment contains a lot of messages in favour of the government’s actions, but on the other hand there are words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
Such are infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanom.
The IMF believes that growth projects should be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts for Finland a 0.4% economic growth this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
In its new economic forecast, Danske forecasts that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, the Statistics Centre that total output had increased slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki notes.
The weakened confidence in the industry or other so-called softer metrics may have been paid less attention.
However, the difference is only a few percentages.
Nintendo has appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iva, who died of cancer in July, will begin work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of the 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of those names that were raised as a possible successor to Iva.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwa’s footprints, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda said.
Kimishima’s mission is to bring Nintendo strongly into mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
Increasing number of asylum seekers arriving in Finland
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Authority admitted that hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear every year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of minors are missing every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, chief inspector of the Immigration Agency, explains what the situation in Finland is and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many asylum seekers disappear under the land per year? – In Finland, in 2013 a total of 156 asylum applications were filed by minors who came alone.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were filed and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The disappearance may be based on the fact that the applicant is already registered in another country that applies the Dublin Regulation and may have been declared to be of majority there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons are also found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum-seekers in Finland, of whom 134 were deferred because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum-seekers disappeared over the past year, he says.
Is the number growing?
As of September 6, this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from single minors.
There is no total statistics on missing minors asylum-seekers this year, but the number of minors asylum-seekers is therefore known and has increased significantly, which is likely to affect the number of missing, he emphasizes.
What about those who have received the decision?
Are they going to disappear in the ‘dark market’?
This is difficult to assess from the Migration Agency, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of the decision on conversion, Kannelmaa stresses.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo has expressed concern over the growing number of unregistered prospects.
He has taken action on this.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU interior ministerial meeting, said on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A’s studio online - see photos of devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkosen, a pioneer in the media industry who lost his workability due to illnesses, is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s wife Nina Mikkonen sells on Huuto.net devices that were once the most advanced tools for professionals in their field.
This was the first announcement by the online newspaper Iltamakasinini.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been left to the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV shows are no longer filmed on Betacam tape.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested people will be found.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is such an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts – collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset are trying to move away from their current Myrskylän home.
We cannot carry all the goods with us.
I slowly began to invent and see what things to give up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
Television and radio equipment are no longer available.
After a recent stroke, it is clear that a man who has had a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was filed in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from the stormy store.
Traffic threatens to crash worse than thought: Metro and trams may stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend force action in connection with Friday’s demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief confidant Pekka Hirvonen says that the oak is big on the field.
Night and tide cuts are harming drivers, so the government’s plans for cutting the tolls are provoking resistance.
Hirvonen thinks that stopping the traffic all day is a sort of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stops on Friday, public transportation in the capital region will be almost entirely stopped.
According to data from VR, trains do not run between six in the morning and six in the evening on Friday.
There is no long-distance or short-distance traffic on Friday.
The trains departing in the morning will be sent to the station.
According to HSL data, most of the buses will be left in shutdown.
ACT members are out of work on Friday from three in the morning to three in the morning on Saturday.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they will be driven with the lead force, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says the HSL cannot say exactly which buses will run on Friday.
The workers’ organizations will organize a large demonstration at the Helsinki Railway on Friday from 11 to 13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to get to Europe, according to the AP news agency.
According to Sky News, refugees attempted to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media reports, the Hungarian police also used water bombs against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas: teacher thinks clock was a bomb
In Texas, the 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher held a self-made clock he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he just wanted to showcase the outcome of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers held the clock just like a bomb.
Police were called to the scene, and the situation eventually ended in the fact that the boy was taken to the youth's detention cell in handrails.
Muhammad has never claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
The police said the clock looked like a “film bomb.”
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit plate and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Muhammad was sentenced to three days of forced absence from school.
His father is angry at the incident and the country’s American-Islamic Council is wondering if the incident is another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Corbyn’s own Labour Party members have also joined the criticism.
This has offended the people, Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
In 1940, British Air Force pilots fought the German Luftwaffe.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he showed respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We are all in an enormous debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn’s election as leader has divided Labour.
Especially among parliamentarians there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favor of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and increased public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled to appear today for the first time as leader of the party in parliament at the Prime Minister’s questioning hour.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions about what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Earlier this week, Cameron tweeted about Corbyn’s election as party leader.
The Labour Party is a threat to our national security, our economic security and the security of our families.
The cause of Minnesota family death remains unclear - the father of the family awaited trial
Police in South Lake Minnetonka have investigated a family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10 and a few days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short committed suicide in his garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of the children.
Based on this announcement, police went into the house for an inspection visit and found the short family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions and a successful business
The investigation into the case of South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motives for the bloodshed are still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his fortune on the nurse-focused social media site AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 StarTribune interview, Short said the site had four million different visitors each week.
I have received 50 purchase offers for the company over the past ten years.
I have abandoned them all.
I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Per at some point I will sell the company, but not yet.
Short’s family bought a house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate site in Zillow as the dream of a car collector: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Trial ongoing
According to StarTribune, however, the family’s father was awaiting a trial.
Achieve Test Prep, which offered various preparation courses, sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments defamatory to prep courses had been removed from Short’s website, and as a result they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s transactions.
The Loire Coffee Coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippo's Horse Owner of the Month Award at the feeding event.
This is great, Loiri commented with a kindness of honour.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned a win of €100,000.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of the Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still don’t believe it has happened.
With Loir, the successful horse coach Korpi gets full working peace when working with the horse.
Pepe decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I hold my shame, Loiri cried.
A stunning gesture from the NHL star - "The biggest donation made by an athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
The hospital said it was the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other funding for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
Subban’s donation is therefore significantly greater than his annual income of $9 million.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a hall space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have previously helped significantly local hospitals.
The longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a giant sum of money for another major hospital in the city, which provided the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
In a Japanese cafe, you can order your wife for the evening - serving food only in a bikini and an essay.
Coffee is a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a barbecue cafe and now a wife cafe.
It strikes the lonely, accompanied and hungry.
This was by Metro.
In Tokyo’s Ore no Yome coffee shop, you can book for your wife or husband’s evening.
A waitress who pretends to be a client’s spouse.
The "partner" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is faced with an essu and bikini, while the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides women candidates with all the information about length and weight, including the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: Vehicle security attacks have begun
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) will also support technological development and innovation in the industry, Intel said in a statement.
The committee consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct continuous security tests and audits to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of its best practices for cybersecurity.
In the future, the company will update the report based on the findings of ASRB research.
Global ICT research and consulting firm Gartner estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 percent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share networked data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, chief executive of Intel Security.
The ASRB enables Intel to establish best practices in security and support the vision that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making an ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
The Ford Focus RS will cost approximately 52,000 euros.
Ford’s Focus RS has been expected for years as a moon rising.
The car is finally coming to Finland.
Ford has revealed the details of the RS now as the automotive world looks at the Frankfurt Auto Show.
Ford’s new four-wheeled RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds thanks to its 2.3-liter 350 horsepower engine and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting for the Finns, initially it is said to be 52 000 euros.
The car is now available to order, although when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in a statement.
Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show: the new Sportage and the new Optima.
The most important of the two innovations is the new fourth-generation Sportage, with which Kia plans to seize a greater share of the ever-growing street SUV market.
The new Sportage, created under the leadership of European design director Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than ever.
The axle and outer dimensions have become a centimeter to one here and the car passes through the air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but it has been added to the 1.6-liter turbo, which develops 177 horsepower.
More about the Kia Sporttag and its performance and consumption will be told closer to the sale.
We still have to wait a little while for the new Sportage to arrive in the spring of 2016.
Before the end of the year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, it doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving capabilities, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
The Optimizes are equipped with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate with the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine.
At the same time, with its arrival, the sale of Optima farmar begins.
Chisu Returned to the Stage - Rushed in a Brave Shirt
The singer Chisu will participate in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue dress has a spectacular, open neck opening.
This is a beautiful presentation of the singer’s belt.
The crown of the whole is a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer who became a mother has been able to punish pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
My daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released his first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and standing in front of a large audience after a long break doesn’t really excite me.
Everything has to do with music, the singer says.
In a few weeks, Chisu will release their fourth album, Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new pieces.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood style is surprising again - now appears the chest
Real TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives speeches one after another.
She’s showcasing her pregnancy belly and breastplate in gorgeously sexy clothes, last night at 1 p.m. American Time when she left with her sister Kourtney Kardashian from her husband Kanye West’s show.
The black dress is transparent on the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress in the flash of lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian was wearing an amazon-like maternity suit, she visited her friend for dinner invitations in New York just a few days ago.
It was highlighted by black shoes.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as it was last Friday, when the presentation turns on the pregnancy stomach.
The harsh laws of the fashion world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the idea that the modeling world would be pure glamour and a champagne party.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out about modeling.
Harpeer’s Bazaar magazine summarized Leloup’s six harsh truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins from scratch.
Even if you’d posed in top designer costumes in the previous season, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season there are new, fresh faces in the field that compete for work with concards.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is continuous travel and can go for years so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment in which the fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you’re very young and your mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one kind of humility.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris they say you’re too thin.
Getting a job is always a risky game.
During the Fashion Week, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion week ends, the difference is sharp.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are fooled by the fact that everyone thinks work is just a presentation of clothes.
They want to be their own personality.
Work makes models feel like they’re actors with a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
In the show of Tory Burch.
New York is currently celebrating a fashion week, where designers will reveal their next year’s collections.
Roope Salminen plays the most unknown musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays the band’s founding member Antti Lautalaa in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is a big challenge for me, because I am a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I play the 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen Laurahta.
I didn’t want to meet the real Ant before the shootings, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unfamiliar of those people, so I think it’s good that I learn his playing style only from the video.
I do not want to imitate a person.
The man who loots the completely empty Roope Salminen and Dogs group does not go into the role.
Punk manners come from nature.
In the punk episode of the Star, Star show, many of you have probably seen the prequel, as well as if you have ever visited our shows.
Our appearance has never been a small fault, but we always go in full.
The lead actors of Tuukka Temosen’s “That’s Us Beautiful” film, which played bass in 1993-2004, were announced today.
The band’s core group, which has become familiar to the public, is played by young actors still quite unknown to the general public.
Drumpali Sipe Santapukk is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtas Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about her upcoming release yesterday evening, when she told Snapchat that she was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope has already posted on Instagram a photo of her new look, which she has had to realize for the film.
Roope, who had previously been seen in shovels and a pair of wool, has shaved her face to siloposki, and colored her brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think in recent days about how to tell their children about the situation of refugees seeking to Europe.
Is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to be forced to talk about it, advises psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis group.
Younger children should be protected and not, for example, let them watch news alone.
Young children aren’t always able to understand what they see, and it can keep their minds turning around and annoying, she says.
However, if a child has encountered television news footage about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is important to listen to the child’s questions and listen carefully to what he asks.
The child’s feelings can be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks they are afraid of.
It is not necessary to intimidate a child in vain, even if he is intimidated and frightened.
The younger child closely monitors the behavior of their parents.
If the parents remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Older children are likely to encounter discussion about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
It is important for parents to talk to them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents can, together with their children, think about how this is treated in our family.
Is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives – some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model on how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This may be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
At the end of the day?
You can be a good parent for your child.
The bullshit is hard to control
Pertu Pohjola was hit by Apila Pallosala in the middle of the season.
It scattered only wins and second places until a collapse in the Tampere raves at the end of July.
As the eagle crumbled deeply, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his protector time from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the disappearance was revealed.
The horse had a headache.
The disease was not mild, but it required two treatments to overcome it.
Because Apila Pallosala had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says that he is positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was in the record time after the second SE-Tamma Taruntu.
Apila Ballosala was very pressured from the break, when she had only been able to run normally for a few weeks.
Considering those things, a small slope at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a decent competition made the Orion sharp.
The horse was going on, and hopefully it was going on.
The Pallos of Apila have been so-called humorous horses.
When it was not entertained, it could have been thrown into a juice without even getting sick.
On a good day, however, the orie has disbanded such a lightning signal that the opponents have been surprised.
At top speed, fellow competitors can’t handle the Ballosalam, from which even warm-blooded rides get rid of.
In the north there is a desire.
However, the different thing is how the Apila Ballosala will agree to it.
It’s quite difficult at the start and can even be stuck under the boom of the start car and so on.
Hopefully, it would be quieter than going down.
Apila’s Ballosala will be able to come out of the bow when it’s in good shape, and we’ll go with it to win, the coach promises.
This is why you will not get rid of unnecessary iPhone apps
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple’s iPhone phones may be removed sometime in the future – but not all.
Apple is likely to remove some of its own apps from iPhone phones in the future, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with Buzzfeed.
There are a number of apps on Apple’s iPhone that are relatively rare to use: for example, FaceTime calls, Press Kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a compulsory update to iPhone phones, although it’s only needed for Apple’s smartwatch owners.
Cook says removing Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work firmly with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
Cook said Apple is investigating the matter because it doesn’t want to waste memory on iPhone users.
Eurozone inflation dropped to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area increased only slightly in August, or 0.1% from the previous year, the EU statistical agency Eurostat today.
The rise in prices was driven down by the lowering of energy prices.
Eurostat revised its 0.2% forecast slightly lower than a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 percent.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat’s forecast for base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy was 7.2% cheaper in the euro area last month than a year ago.
In all 28 EU countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 percent.
Consumer prices rose by 1.4 percent in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest when prices fell by 1.9 percent.
In Finland, the inflation rate was minus 0.2 percent according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area is still far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a price rise of 2 percent in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rate will rise to 1.1 percent, the central bank predicted in its new inflation forecast released in early September.
The Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next U.S. recession will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more within three years after the country’s central bank, the Fed, has begun to raise interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the downturn, in turn, begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that it will start raising interest rates this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession could be pushed up at its fastest by next autumn and as the exchange rate of the financial markets before that.
Or at least that’s what happens if the world’s largest economies and financial markets function as they used to – and if they react to the Fed’s extortion of money as they did before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker of Deutsche Bank in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed more than 60 pages of its Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who compiled the survey and the report do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen to the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use their cool facts and calculations from economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different pattern than at the time of previous interest rate increases – and what may result from it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a better condition to withstand the rise of interest rates than ever since the 1950s.
Not even a year before the beginning of the recession.
Thro the past summer and early autumn, the leaders of the Fed’s monetary policy and its current orientation have suggested that the time has begun to mature for interest rates.
The first rate hike in more than nine years may occur this week.
The decision will be made on Wednesday and Thursday, when the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee will meet for a two-day meeting.
The Fed last raised its Fed interest rate in June 2006.
That was the end of a two-year series of relatively regular but at a time small 0.25 percentage point interest rate increases, with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The symptom of financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the U.S. most risky housing funding company, and a year later the financial crisis broke into a global day of judgment nightmare.
There was a major recession in 2009.
Last time, severe downturns in the financial markets and the real economy started more slowly than have typically occurred since the previous Fed interest rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were then harsher and harsher than ever since the 1930s.
German strategists have screened the ups and downs of the world’s largest economies and the turnarounds of the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
They have been reporting on the Fed’s interest rate hikes and their economic and financial implications since the 1950s.
From the first rate hike to the beginning of the recession, less than a year has passed, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
Financial markets have ended up rising within a year or two of the Fed’s start of interest rate increases.
The Fed has, in turn, increased and decreased its core interest rates for a dozen different cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
Each time has differed to some extent from the other, and the times are examined relatively rarely, so on the basis of them it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of subsequent interest rate increases.
The experts say that many things are different this time.
Not only better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, even the culprits, may not be undeniably discovered even by decades of research.
But three factors that led to the crisis and increased its devastating power may be quite undeniably clear:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks in the world held their main interest rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They planted the traces of the technology bubble, and at the same time raised the next one.
2) The amount of debt accumulated over the decades in the various sectors of the financial and real economy, which has already been excessive, has grown even greater under the influence of monetary policy.
It was the largest debt bubble in economic history.
3) The crazy debt financing, which has almost slowed down in the financial economy in particular, inflated the largest exchange-rate bubbles in the history of the financial market for most segments, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly possible to argue that the financial markets, which have risen to heights due to increasingly complex debt bulls, were in a rare, dangerous and volatile situation when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The financial structures, even the valuation bubbles, which were tailored to the debt bursts, did not last until after the interest raises had begun and the costs of debt financing had turned to rise.
The risks came into being as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
More debt and more debt.
The German strategists don’t guess what will happen next, but they give the point by mentioning the following, for example:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy orientation even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for a long time before the crisis, they are now even lower for a longer time.
2) Borrowing has not been crazy for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now debt money at its cheapest is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and real-economy debt ratio has not eased, but now in different parts of the economy there is a heavier debt burden than before the financial crisis or half of it ever before.
3) The liquidity issued by central banks, which is increasingly fluctuating and less expensive, has largely remained in the financial markets and has silenced key securities and assets to their most expensive peak since or ever before the financial crisis.
Not only are the strategists alerting the financial markets, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the worst recession in decades to the pattern ever seen.
The eurozone economy has hardly recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state but, accordingly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, as the Fed next time begins to tighten its currency bonds.
Per the picture of the future of the French banking company Societe Generale’s strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it suddenly seems.
He has long trained the bank’s international investor clients for the following full translations of the Fed:
First, the Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles will break out – and soon it is time for the Fed to shut down the financial crashes with even greater QE splashes.
Hewlett-Packard, a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will be for HP’s corporate service side, the company says.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
Last year, the number of employees was reduced to 30,000.
The company records a one-off cost of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) for the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will cut 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
Reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10 percent of its business results.
Last year, its three most important customers accounted for 65 percent of its business profit.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking “General” and then selecting “Software Update”.
If the update is complete, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have experienced problems after this installation when the "Software Update Failed" error message appears on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to upgrade through iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests apps to be removed and then reinstalled when the update is completed.
Make sure that the phone is charged or close to the charger during the upgrade, so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed because if the battery is out, it can cause the update to fail.

Yle: Minister Berner has served in the board of a tax haven company
Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communications, has served as a member of the board of directors of the tax haven company.
According to YLE, the company’s activities involve so-called tax planning.
It concerns the Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Commercial Register, Berner remains an official member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says he submitted a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked the matter and it is enough that I have submitted a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company manages the shares of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served in the board of directors of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and, after the merger, in the board of directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ ownership in Luxembourg passes through a multi-stage ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs, the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the board of directors of Karelia-Upofloor, which is owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was searched for a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to take care of the capital interests of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the income from the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was safeguarded in this context, Berner says.
Berner says that the holdings of Hartwall Capital in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure in tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the capital fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
A company-run reception center opens in Espoo
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception center is ready to receive the first 100 inhabitants as of this evening.
Within a week, the number of seats can increase to 300-400 people.
The Immigration Agency establishes a reception centre in the property of the former Salvation Institute.
The activity isined by Luona Oy, whose activity is in particular the production of healthcare and medical care services.
The city of Esbo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy have agreed together, among other things, on the security arrangements of the center.
STTK prepares alternative package for work-life blackmail
STTK is preparing an alternative package to the government’s blackmail on the workplace.
The organization is also looking to include other employee centers.
According to President Antti Palola, at the moment the attention is on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative ways to lower the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to journalists during a break from the organization’s administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Economic and Social Union (EK) is not prepared for talks.
STTK economists have calculated that the change protection contained in the government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated €30 million, while the other side of the package is €2700 million.
I don’t know if there’s a great enthusiasm for a party to engage in a conversation if there’s a relationship between one and a hundred.
Palola: Negotiations have been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to give a communication to the parliament about its own package and start preparing the reforms.
He did not assert that the timetable was realistic.
The dialogue with the government, according to Palola, has always been constructive.
For the staff center organization STTK’s field, especially the cutting of Sunday days is a painful place, according to Palola.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from mandatory legislation that would implement part of the blackmails.
In the STTK, according to Palola, there is no warming up for the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP that raised the matter.
Employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the government’s extortion package presented last week.
As part of the package, wages for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 percent and holidays will be shortened.
The STTK emphasizes that the central organizations have invited workers to demonstrate and that it was not intended to organize a strike.
Acknowledgment thanks
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder welcomes STTK’s announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK will now be on the same line with Akava, as an alternative model for government proposals has been outlined in Akav.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without the SAK the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will be involved in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change protection and working time banks.
Akava said on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal with which it is ready to negotiate a 5% competitiveness leap aimed by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to consider the terms of the employment relationship as part of the contract.
In exchange, we want change protection and working time banks, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava’s lines, as STTK did earlier on Wednesday.
Without it, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model for the country’s government and employers,” Fjäder said.
The committee will meet on Thursday at 5 p.m. to decide on the possible contents of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talcoos" - play bingo while Sipilän talks in the evening
Green Left University of Tampere
Tampere University Green Left Viva bingo voucher for the evening.
Prime ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on YLE channels on Wednesday evening at 21:5 p.m.
In order to seek a similar previous speech of the Prime Minister, we must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he delivered the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä uprising.
After that, the president and ministers held several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuing War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train operators in a television address.
Monarchy and Monarchy
The speech of Sipilö has aroused criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
Leftist chairman Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that “Sipilä could consider his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the prime minister, in which case the speech would also be discussed.”
According to the Greens, “a single call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned the “monarchist mindset: the prime minister tells the people what is best for him.”
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä’s dialogue: “Long half a year from the elections.
No appearance of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
has been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the speech was recorded in advance and lasted about 15 minutes.
It was commented in a live broadcast by the Chairman of the ECF, Lauri Lyly, and EK CEO, Jyri Häkämies.
Criticism has been given about the presentation of the speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it belongs to the task of the public service to promote comprehensive publicity across Finland, says Ismo Silvo Yle, head of YLE publications.
Like at the time of Tammeleon
The speech also sparked discourse.
In the evening, the dinner is served in good time, the children are shaved and dressed as best they can.
Mother wears a gorgeous collar, and Dad puts a tie on her neck.
At nine o’clock we are silent in front of the TV like we did in the time of Me Tammeloide,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why there are millionaries sitting in the Finnish government in tax havens who hide their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time claim to the people that it is compulsory to cut when the state is running out of money?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of Tampere University.
He posted a bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear about the same boat, common coal, living in debt and team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to remove al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected a Russian offer to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to resign, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan by which Assad would after some time withdraw from power elegantly.
But the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin listed him in a bilateral discussion with three points of plan: the opposition should not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad should be immediately communicated, and Assad’s withdrawal from power must be carried out in a modest manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell you what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting.
Ahtisaari said he sent the message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the conversation, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
United Nations diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's allegations, but said that al-Assad's forces had already carried out a number of massacres at that time and key opposition groups rejected any agreements that would have allowed him to remain in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the British Foreign Ministry’s Middle East department, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s remarks because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Tshurkin spoke with a Moscow mandate.
If he had told me about Churkin’s speeches, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected Putin’s attempt to hold power by a supporter of al-Assad.
Refugees in our own actions
During the Ahtisaari negotiations, approximately 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the number of deaths at the beginning of this year exceeded 220,000.
More than 11 million people have fled their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our responsibility.
I have no choice but to take care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Asylum Seekers Centre in Turniou
The asylum-seekers arrangement center planned by the government in northern Finland is likely to be established in Torni.
The center would be established in the empty building of the Township of Tornion in the city center.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has sought a place suitable for the need to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat on Tuesday that the board had already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the ministry.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the City Council of Toronto, Sauli Hyöppinen, this is not true.
When the whole council was not gathered and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to convene a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates present.
Thirteen councillors were opposed.
On the basis of this, we can expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and responded quickly.
There are estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked whether it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense, Nousiainen says.
Labour market is an alternative to blackmail.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (central), the halving of public holiday pensions would only deal with part of the government’s aimed to reduce the price of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on it.
Sipilä told reporters in parliament that he has not been in contact with the labour market organizations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations were looking for remedies for the government-declared workforce blackmail.
If such an agreement arises, we will welcome it as part of the overall package.
According to Sipilä, half-cutting the holiday allowance would be effective because it would affect almost all payers unlike, for example, the government’s planned Sunday allowance cuts.
Labour market organisations could agree on cuts in holiday allowances because they are recorded in collective agreements rather than in the law.
With these outlook, the government will announce to the parliament on Wednesday about the blackmail in the working world as a statement from the State Council.
According to the ministry, the proposals should be known before.
There is no final deadline either.
The legislative work then begins, i.e. the train is in motion and it is becoming more and more difficult.
Now is a lot of time.
It doesn’t take long, if there is a will, to formulate such things.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of slum and helatorst to unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working time.
In addition, the salary for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75 percent and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
The workers' centers organize a large demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi authority approved the expansion of the mahlahall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Board unanimously approved the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy’s hall, i.e. the mahlahall’s warehouse.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is larger and more expensive than originally discussed.
It also has a busy schedule.
It was also a little strange that the need for land was not known a year ago when the decision on the previous expansion was made.
At this stage, an expansion of the inventory by 400-450 square meters was approved as part of the investment program, but the money will be decided later in the context of the semi-annual report.
Even on the agenda, there was an investment of 150,000-200,000 euros, but at the meeting technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Language in the river
The City Government eased its previously sharp stance on bringing Karelia-language street signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the cultivation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the Karelian language because there is no historical basis for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the river area has belonged more to the Eastern Savoy language.
After the new decision, there will be no street signs in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is also ready for the use of the Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in information boards and in tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended to all other participants.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, it is worth taking a wide-minded approach to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism is alive and is rapidly changing even in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a peculiarity of the province, as is the view of Joensu as the entire Finnish forest capital.
Both can be used for a wide range of marketing activities.
The closure of rail connections cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in rail connections are striking the vitality of the province with a tough hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the economy and competitiveness of the province.
And that affects whether it is possible to live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wondered.
He also highlights aviation, which has also been repeatedly discussed in the report.
It is important for the whole of the province that our chances of succeeding are not reduced by state power measures, as is now happening.
We should look at the impact of these closures on employment, Karjalainen emphasizes.
The deterioration of traffic connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services there are, such as traffic connections and housing, the easier it will be to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor traffic connections also affect the research team, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that already at the moment it is difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the cross-directional connections are weak.
Approximately half of the university’s students are from outside Finland.
Approximately 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
The river became one of my waves.
The view of the Joensuu City Council on the provincial Siun sote project is apparently unanimous, but there is one among the voices.
The city council member Pentti Keskisalo (pictured) proposed to abandon the entire project at the meeting of the council on Monday, but his proposal disappeared as unprofitable.
The Board of Directors approved the draft decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train ride from the Eagle to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue to exist in the future, although one pair of trains will be fewer.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains are missing, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
This is due to state austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ rail transport purchase funds for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quiet routes are closed.
VR will set a new schedule by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn’t get down, the boys lived from the spot
The rescue agency rescued a 12-year-old man who climbed to the roof of the roof and could not come down from the roof.
The incident occurred on the street at half six o’clock on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there are no stairs to the roof.
It did not stop the group of boys, who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio-amateur mast next to it.
The other two went down the same path, but one did not.
As a result, others lived from the spot and passers alerted the rescue service to help the last person left on the roof safely return to the ground.
FedEx operating profit doubles, lowers outlook for fiscal year 2016
FedEx depressing results for its last quarter, with the shipping giant cutting its year-round earnings forecast due to weakened demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock fell by about 2.5 percent at the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects a profit of $10.40 to $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents lower than its previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The smaller outlook came despite averaging 4.9% price increases that came into effect on 4 January, and despite higher supplementary charges starting in November for land shipments of heavy or large packages.
The company said it expects operating profits to continue to grow from the previous year as they have cut costs, revenue has grown, and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “performs steadily given the worse than expected economic conditions, in production and global trade.”
Plans for salaries for the holiday were announced a day after the competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, roughly the same amount it hired last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx’s earnings were $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
Profit per share was $2.42, which is below the average forecast of $2.44. 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
The turnover increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In the Zacks survey, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority shipping, which has stopped the development of its Express unit turnover.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit increased by 29%, but the revenue of the operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
The income of the Express unit was better due to higher basic fees, while business profits in freight operations were reduced by higher labor costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 percent in the bill for this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
This week, the U.S. central bank’s rulers will sit around a huge table for two days in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-story meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Central Bank President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the central bank: they must maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression, however, central bank executives have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This third requirement may be a crucial factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so tight that it can’t even be predicted.The decision on whether the U.S. economy is ready to be detached from the record-breaking incentive brought by zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Although most data indicate that the economy is growing steadily, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets may have made central bank officials, who are already in caution, even more frightened about increasing instability.
“It is understandable that the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to follow,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief financial expert at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“H, I believe that if they are looking for a justification for a postponement of interest rates, the increased uncertainty in the global markets is a valid reason to wait yet,” he says.
There is no consensus on the central bank’s decision, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg survey, about half of economists predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets are expecting the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator shows that the chance of growth is only about 30 percent.
This indicates a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next raise will not happen soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to a new figure of 16.599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by expectations that the central bank will keep its level unchanged this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now,” he says.
If policy makers raise interest rates, “they’ll have to put a lot of effort into their line-up to support the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argue that a raised level would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago it seemed that the central bank would raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary state that would secure the stability of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed in August, growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate dropped last month to 5.1 percent, the lowest level in seven years and close to what the central bank considers the limit to full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of boost.
Although inflation is still below the central bank’s 2 percent annual target, the central bank’s decision makers say the main reason for this is the temporary effect of the significantly lower oil price.
The economy “is able to cope with higher interest rates and needs them, given the tight conditions in the labour market,” says Ian Shepherdson, chief finance expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shocked last week as China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by up to 16 percent from its record in May, as investors feared China's slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has somewhat recovered this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 percent below its May peak.
For central bankers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells why interest rates should be raised.
“Without these financial market events and the recent weeks of news about the weakness of China’s economy, decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
“The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear, and they do not have much information at their disposal as to the consequences of the events in China,” Oliner said.
The welfare of the international economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not influence decision-making.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the hint of the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank could “strike” the increase in the amount of money, caused turmoil in the markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” says Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “the central bank has overreacted to the movements of the financial markets that have seemed to be separate from the underlying elements of the economy.”
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, cites 1998-1999 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings “despite its limited, identifiable effects on U.S. economic growth,” Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank revoked these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritize financial stability during a major crisis, such as when the market crashed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The latest turmoil will not come close to its level, Posen says.
“No one wants a situation in which interest rates are feared to rise because the markets are collapsing,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability. As long as this is the case, I think they should not anticipate it.

Brazilian Children’s Health Organization in Rio Grande Advertises Healthy Diet for Breastfeeders
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking their breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should do.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet has been found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel's Sunrise is a favorite in viewing, despite Channel Nine's attempts to report a leader's disclosure on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s rush to Canberra to report on the aftermath of the Liberal Party’s leadership defeat failed to increase Today’s audience.
Channel Nine's morning show was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, led by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts that also cover Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls, and Cancun.
The distance burden did not seem to bother Australian television viewers, as Sunrise’s average viewers in five state capitals were 397,000, compared with Today’s 339,000.
The average of Today rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has captured Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today’s average was 318,000 and Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
So far, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, while Today has a figure of 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The winds of change will blow outside of Parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published today on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news on the Seven channel was the stunning premiere of the 800-word series featuring former star of the Packed to the Rafters series Erik Thomson.
The new drama series, which collected a pretty impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson would become the driving force of the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night gave this real certainty.
The X Factor on Seven Channel was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
Andrew O’Keefe’s first half-hour show (17-17.30) attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) raised 623,000 spectators - which was enough for a small win on Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat show (613,000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour average audience was 520,000, while the second half was 720,000.
Hot Seats average was 620,000.
The drop in the second night’s viewing average for The Chase Australia brings the Nine channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute show, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on McGuire's show.

The final trio agrees with fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but whom does he choose?
The secret has been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who will win the Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor has been kept extremely secret.
The three remaining girls don’t really know who got the last rose.
However, when we spoke with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before the three became two, they could accidentally give a hint about the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood’s lips are sealed before Thursday’s final
All three women stumbled into poetry when telling how Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family value, and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked, “If Wood’s last rose is not for you, who should it be for?” their answers could provide a revelation of who won the boy’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best alternative to Wood after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been uncomplicated since the first day.
“From the moment I walked into the house, [Sarah’s] energies and Sam’s energies felt quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind throughout the series,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is really close to the earth, it’s fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I’ve seen them together and there’s chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would fit well together.
Mackay said last week’s home visits made him realize that Wood could be “the right one.”
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game – I’m now involved with all my heart in this,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say it,” he said.
I like the other girls just as much, so it’s a match between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 19:30 on Ten Channel.
“Sarah’s Best Alternative to Sam Wood?”
Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him after his impressive open day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seemed to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the replacement bench for the final game after this Australian rugby league converter dropped the ball in his first crash return as the team defeated Minnesota on Tuesday by a 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return to the next crash and took him into a running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real character of Tomsula was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of lulling his newcomers into a battlefield in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-match press conference.
49ers Special Editor Cam Inman reports that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Teams Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the ball dropped and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the crash that the Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter
This wasn’t the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for for a man’s NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on his way out of the field after the fall, and later told the Australian radio pair Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on frequency 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
“It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his casting to his 2007 Origin debut, when a feed on his own scoring area led to the Queensland goal.
Overall, it was a wonderful experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photo posted on her Instagram account with fans holding an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun threatening on a Siberian runway.
Hodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
Four killed in gunfire against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's new constitution, authorities said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh district about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
High-ranking local official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to kill but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in recent weeks of violent protests across the southern shores of Nepal, in which members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution will weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
At the time, the four main parties signed an agreement dividing the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Legislators have voted this week on the provisions of the constitution in Kathmandu, and authorities have said the new charter could be approved by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center NHC says there is a 60 percent chance of a tornado south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure front, located about 560 kilometers south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde archipelago, has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical tornado within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another precisely-limited low-pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verde island group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical tornado over the next two days, the Miami-based weather center added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign aiming to raise $11 million to humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who have arrived in Europe fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it posted a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being announced by a manager, her personal experience was written by Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
“Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has escalated, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations come from four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will pay the same amount for every donation made globally on google.com/refugeerelief, up to $5.5 million, so the overall target is $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, primarily due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after diet surgery than those treated by other methods than surgery.
“It takes a long time to get death data,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, who is a diet-cutting surgeon who wrote the main article for the new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In weight loss or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the abdomen.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the majority of individuals involved in the study have been pathologically obese, and their body mass index (BMI) has been 35 or higher.
BMI, or weight/length ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is above 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person’s BMI is above 30, it is considered to be obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and stomach reduction, to drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the subjects cut down from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those treated other than surgically remained roughly the same in 29.
In 36% of the subjects, diabetes was completely cured and in 28% partially.
For comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1 percent and partially by about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients’ blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should stay below 7 percent, the researchers write.
The postoperative hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the drug-treated group, however, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
However, this improved “glycemic control” characterized by improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average results between two different types of operations.
For the fifth year, when compared to the group undergoing stomach reduction surgery, the group undergoing stomach bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 kg and 14.2 kg respectively), lowered their weight index more (7.4 and 5.1), lowered their hemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent respectively), and had a greater likelihood of achieving complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research findings from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who underwent diet surgery had a 29 percent lower chance of dying over a 15-year period when compared to the group who had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not show any improvement in survival for surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging, however, for individuals with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
“The findings are crucial precisely in that they show that surgery is safe for the group with a lower weight index,” and it is not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the stage when a patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, reversing the situation is very difficult.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he held at the opening ceremony of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day British visit.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of the whole of humanity should be put before the needs of individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
“Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said in a speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised the German and Austrian actions in the crisis, he stressed that this is only a temporary solution.
“It’s great to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring true peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mostly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Taking a stance on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, arguing that the violent response of the United States caused the chain’s violent events.
“After the 9/11 attacks, in a letter I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, the number of children who swallow hand disinfectants has increased by four times.
Poisoning data centers across the United States have a 400 percent increase in the ingestion of strong alcoholic hand disinfectant in children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgian Poisoning Data Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Center for Poisoning Information, the number of cases of ingesting disinfectant in children under 12 years of age to the Poisoning Information Centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are on surveillance,” Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or respond to a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap rise god.
According to reports, teens have mixed the disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwater to get a stronger drink.
The pleasant smells of disinfectant can attract younger children.
“The child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handsets) are those that have added smell.
There are desinfectants with the scent of strawberries, grapes and oranges that are very attractive to children’s minds.
Hand disinfectant can contain anything between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
“It’s really concentrated alcohol,” Mr. Stephen Thornton, head of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital’s Center for Poisoning Information, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don’t let the whiskey shot lay on the table, but the hand disinfectant is left in sight, and if children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who some time ago only swallowed four injections of strawberries of hand disinfectant at school and was taken to first aid.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit for drunk driving in adults, said Chris Ritchey, a first aid clinic doctor who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah stumbled while speaking and was unable to walk when he arrived at the first aid.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children’s hospital for possible brain injury symptoms as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“It was really scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant towels and keep the disinfectant out of children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unspecified ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth-grade students planned to poison their “dirty” teacher by spreading a bacterial poison into the classroom, a police report said.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand disinfectant and forbids it from her class.
The police should prevent the plan as a “drunken nonsense” and leave disciplinary measures to the school district.
Celtic: There is no conflict
Griffiths disregards rumors about Celtic conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight position, but she makes it turn
Hearts fights the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson’s charges, and Warburton is on the lookout for January recruitments that could disrupt the team’s unity
Dons raised lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney’s first half penalty shot led Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at the Pittodre Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths Minimizes Speech of Conflicts
There have been rumors of internal conflicts in Celtic, but Griffiths passed them immediately. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer eye when the team is preparing to face the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to the match.
The absence of the Scottish championship tired the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador, de Boer, said: "The highlights of Celtic games are no longer shown in the Netherlands and why?"
Because the Rangers are not involved.
People here can’t just talk about Rangers’ return.
They are talking about the Old Firm teams.
They’re talking about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and other non-Scots also like to follow them in the games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting loss from the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who is now at the top of the series with a five-point gap to the next.
Deila, however, said: “Celtic has had bad seasons in the past, and we’re going to get up again.”
Now we just want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We do, too, but we have to continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
It is important to stay together.
Warburton announces January player transfers
While Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible January player transfers, he is cautious about the recruitment bump, assuring he doesn’t want to confuse the team’s consensus.
A former Brentford boss said: “The January transition window is very different from the summer window.”
For the players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the time before the whole season, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more trouble.
Celtic’s Michu points to retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name is associated with the transfer window with Celtic, has suggested that he could retire after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old has had knee problems for two years, and during the summer he failed to find a new club outside Wales.
Hearts ready to fight against Scottish Football Federation over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost after that 3-2.
Neilson remains behind his message, arguing, “I didn’t question honesty, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was punished after admitting he sang an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derby at the Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was a moment of mood,” the attacker said, adding, “it’s safe to say I won’t go back to Tynecastle unless I go to Celtic.”
Tannadice Board Believes in Dundee United Leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dundee United board still has faith in the leadership team’s ability to reverse the situation, but admits that the decline in players has to stop.
“I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’ll get the boys back,” Donnelly says.
McInnes is pleased with Hamilton’s “grim victory”
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to their seventh consecutive league win thanks to Adam Rooney’s first half penalty kick, which raised them to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, “There is no team that won anything, be it a cup or a league, that would not also win games in this way.”
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains the same as the total number in the UK increases
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 in the period from May to July, while the unemployment rate in the UK increased by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 percent higher than the UK’s 5.5 percent, according to figures from the National Statistics Centre (ONS).
Meanwhile, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employed is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 percent during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan is to build the foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of Britain.
Over the past 12 months, the job market in Scotland has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has decreased.
Why I Witness Execution in Oklahoma
If no legal intervention takes place, later today I will see when the man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I’ll sit in the viewing room at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and watch Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through her best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I’m getting scared as this day approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, have the opportunity to follow the executions in America, and because there are often more applications than there are vacancies, the participants are selected through a terrifying draw.
Oklahoma has reduced media seats from twelve to five.
Whatever you choose, it looks cool.
I cannot do it.
I’m going to sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I’ve also established my own connection to him through the months of calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be both a witness and a reporter, so I can’t carry a notebook and pen to record what I’ve seen.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of being neutral.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story the way he wants, and you can participate.
I complained to the journalist.
He admitted that “he could have put his word better,” but still thinks that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I’t do it even if he said it.
I told him that he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
The Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is by my side.
If you want to know more, you can listen to my podcasts.
I will not go through all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would, in any case, make him guilty of aid.
But I think there is a very strong possibility that he is not guilty of the murder.
There was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And this is the perspective from which I see him dying.
I can’t say I’m completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
From me you will get a description of how it feels to look at the man I like dying unnecessarily.
Man pulled away from Canning River after a waterfall police chase
The officer of Canning Wales remained dry as he dragged the man away from the Canning River.
The attempt by a man from Perth to mislead the police from his tails went wrong when he found himself in low, muddy water just a few meters away from a policeman who tried to “take him gently back to the beach.”
Canning Valley police were summoned on Tuesday for unauthorized intrusion into Beckenham.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to mislead them by directing them to the Canning River.
However, he did not go very far.
“He stood in the water and said, ‘I won’t go, come and pick me up,’” said Senior Colonel Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to be wet, so he used a safer tactic: “good police consultation.”
“Sometimes people do funny things while trying to escape,” said senior colonel Castledine.
Football champion Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned their car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed in his venture, but inspired the locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims officers tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria’s executives tried to infiltrate spies into his stalls last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He accuses the officers and Racing Victoria’s Immortality Division, claiming that they have a personal campaign running against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai’s late rejection due to a treatment on the race day was the final niche.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has come into a difficult situation after Lidar’s unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has been keeping his tongue under control over spying allegations for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like jealousy.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything breaks out at once,” Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I go home today and sleep well.
I want to walk my head up and I want the owners to think that I will do my best in front of them.
When they start to think differently, then I should no longer continue as a coach.
Then I have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody's previously quipped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which he said the integrity department had attempted to spy on his team.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man — I name him when asked — and offered him a job in my tent if he passed information about what I do there.
They clearly consider me a scammer.
If that’s the case, they’d be better off with their lawyers because they’ve failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to take on the team and maybe transfer the responsibility for what is happening in the industry to others than the coaches?
Am I harmful to the world?
Am I so harmful to the world?
Maybe people think so.
Per they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I say now may make them think just that.
But I’m at the point that I don’t care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It really grieves me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has grown with Lidar’s long-term cobalt research, and his late rejection led him to conclude that he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his training of the invincible master Black Caviar, has called the rule of racing day treatments “laughable” after a mud or clay bowl has been placed on a horse’s feet, which is irregular.
“It’s against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on his foot.
It could have been a tomb last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It was on the day.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the grave care on the day of the competition, from which the officers started the investigation.
It is a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Car driver arrested in Cobram
Police have arrested a man who escaped traffic after hitting a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he was seriously injured when a car struck him on the highway in Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia himself to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failing to stop in an accident, failing to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in pressure claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL rugby league champions’ claims that his team’s tackles would be part of the “line.”
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to “weight” on his side when he unexpectedly won the final match in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely had time to hide his reference to Storm after defeating the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final match. Bennett called the game a “show window” for the rugby league and said that the two Queensland teams were not “hardly enthusiastic” about the games.
Bellamy defended his team’s tackles and said they’re just focusing on “contact” while tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by the criticism of the two top coaches toward Storm, as it meant that they were afraid of losing to the team.
“That’s always going to be a talk – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about pushing when we lost 24-2 to them,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or technologies throughout the year.In the last six weeks we have only emphasized contact in tackles, and that has made us succeed.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach for, so he probably isn’t used to losing, and so this was a little shock for him.
It’s strange how this happens at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett’s idea of “exciting rugby” by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons, coached by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing “bored.”
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St. George was often criticized for being a dull team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has quick young guys.
This is the type of game you want to play when you have that type of player.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby – not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I get more confident when they say such things because they’re a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us as opposed to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more striking than the one between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more but is it exciting rugby?
Or is it breaking an exciting line of defense and not drawing?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
The Storm have a free time this weekend because they have already won the right to play a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for the next Saturday night’s pre-final at AAMI Park.
Serbian man fined $200,000 for drug accusation
The man, who is threatened with life sentence for trying to keep 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled to Queensland, has been released against a $200,000 guarantee.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 pounds of drug for a Solay yacht that entered South America via Vanuatu and sailed to Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other defendants in the boat port all morning, and then he met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 pounds of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
While Maksimovic is threatened with a potential lifetime of possession of a quantity of cocaine intended for business, his lawyer argued that there is no evidence that Maksimovic tried to keep the entire amount in his possession, and that he might be in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic would try to escape.
He has close ties with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovich's mother and father had jointly offered a $200,000 guarantee to secure his release.
“After reading the oath testimony of both persons, it is clear that setting a $200,000 guarantee would be a real financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted warranty on the condition that he hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police on a daily basis and abide by his ban on outdoor movements between 6 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl’s phone to lure pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while she was asleep and then logged in to an online communication service where Hogg received numerous blatant pictures of children sent to him by another user.
She woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it asleep in Hogg’s hand.
The girl searched the phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When they arrived, the police saw five pictures, examined the computers at the scene and found “worrying” web searches using search terms that had been used to search for impolite images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this “to attract pedophiles” on the internet, before “pretending to be a police officer to scare them.”
Fiscal Deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: “She said it’s about addiction – that she’s addicted to intimidating people.
He admitted that he had performed a search on a computer but said it was just because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to intimidate pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him pictures, as well as about when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he did this only for feeding purposes.
He said he got sick after drinking and wanted to watch pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures of her phone, she screamed at her mother, trembled and cried.
The mother saw the blatant pictures on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she said the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, admitted his guilt for making or taking pictures of innocent children on 14 June last year, breaking his warranty on 25 January this year and failing to appear in court on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be registered as a sexual offender, as it could be argued that his crime did not contain “significant sexual element”.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the verdict to October so that the social service had time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted warranty in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is in detention before hearing.
He was included in the Sexual Offenders Register before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Speaks to Parliament
Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the ladder earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
Parliament's opening was also stained by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them not to booze Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they buzzed and interrupted him with intermittent screams while he was speaking to parliament on the state of the country — a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe’s speech.
“The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the title of the message is ‘death’,” Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warned parliamentarians concerned that their immunity will end in parliament, and that when they step out, parliamentary immunity will not be valid.
A group discipline supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “preoccupied” with threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is preparing to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and spending cuts in its corporate services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the fastest growing enterprise hardware and service business.
Expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in costs starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring actions will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and CEO, who leads the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we will have a broad and profound range of services that will help companies move into a new business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will generate annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focus on delivering unparalleled integrated technology solutions” for companies, the company said in a statement.
The division dissolves a company founded by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, known as “the birthplace of Silicon Valley”.
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., and its division is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that strictly restricted companies do better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to support injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it’s only September now, and assuming he’s going to rehabilitate as planned, there’s no reason why he won’t play again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshere will miss at least four next England games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championship next summer.
The biggest regret about this latest problem is that Wilshere’s end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the start of the season.
“This kind of injury does not threaten my career,” Wenger said.
It is a bone that has not healed properly.
It is nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankle or previous injuries he has had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, there is always a risk of further injury if a player tries to get back through.
There is also an uncomfortable model being formed.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In the last five seasons, he has played only 65 of Arsenal’s 157 league games.
Looking at Arsenal’s wider overall since the 2007-08 season, in six seasons out of eight, it has been the second league team to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the chance of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes their last season improvement in injury status will continue.
“Sometimes recovering from an injury can be a prone season when you need to strengthen your body and get the competition,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m sure it will, and that he gets the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team as Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then on Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, meaning that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be starting out.
Wenger could also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a break to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear continuing favourite of the F-Group, the Maximir stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo also hasn’t lost in 41 games since they produced their own “Invincible” campaign last season.
The stadium was hit by an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 on the Richter scale on Tuesday night.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned from last season's Champions League surrender against Monaco, and is motivated by the still distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It’s striking how similar descriptions don’t exist in the series, especially considering that men’s need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates among young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common among men than women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of Men. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. The study found that a person’s chance of recovery was doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends had a “healthy mind.”
Similarly, those who were not depressed had half the likelihood of developing potential mental health problems if they had mentally healthy friends.
But in order for a friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this time of communication through social media, style goes beyond content and the immediate response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy, and successful, although in reality isolation prevails.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status.All this happens at the expense of internal values – an inner longing for personal growth and friendship – that affect our mental health more deeply.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money doesn’t bring greater happiness.
The beauty of Freddie was precisely that he turned this focus on his head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which clearly stands out in interaction as friends.
The numerous hugs of Joey and Chandler, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can identify with all this, even though they often hesitate to explore their emotions completely.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me, “by listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really realized how even the slightest interaction with a friend can improve.”
Often men who contact us feel they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of “being overcome” is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you are seen as weak.
Frendit is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term ways to survive.
It highlighted the moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, external position on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
So if you’re attending Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend and all the shooting venues have been redesigned for the celebration, why not take your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, what’s even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes a goal and helps PSG shake Malmö side
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals against Malmö with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in his Champions League debut, helping PSG overtake the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal in less than four minutes in his Champions League debut, pointing the way for the French league champions, but the team missed a number of opportunities before eventually adding their edge when Cavan hit the goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, who is in the same A-group with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion as the game not only included a continuation, but also an improvement in their quarter-finals games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG scored, it wasn’t a classic game, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic of Laurent Blanc lost his place in front of the goal and was later removed from the pitch.
“It’s not easy to win in the Champions League at home or abroad, so winning 2-0 brings trouble to the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it’s a good start, even though there are things we’ll have to brush this season,” Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret not being able to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after an injury with one of three changes made after the team left in a 2-2 draw in the Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he stayed in the shadow of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine squad striker was named the man who will take PSG to a new level in Europe, and he testified why by running Marco Verratti’s feed to catch behind the Malmö defense line and then hitting a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the rear of the net.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big win from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a tough opponent. It won Celtic in the settlement when it reached this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense on its opening field and two players in the deep midfield.
But the team offered little on the offensive side except Nikola Djurdjić’s shot in the 34th minute, which went by the button of the stick from Kevin Trapp’s goal.
PSG, on the other hand, sometimes suffered a shortage of missed inputs and poor finishes, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in a total of five attempts in the first half alone and was then disappointed when Cavani put the ball into Ibrahimovic’s touch right at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in pre-working with his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's feed that Di Maria sent a spin-off that bended around Wiland's goal column at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally achieved one hour after the game thanks to Uruguayan Cavan, who scored his sixth goal in the season after Ibrahimovic had pushed Maxwell's crossover forward from the left.
There, Malmö’s hopes for a return to the game ended, and only Wiland’s brilliant defeat from David Luiz’s direct kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi’s goal was dropped at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was one level higher than his team.The Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was last December.”
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Matching is not enough.
I raise my hat for Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in shares
Swiss-based mining company Glencore, which suffered from a fall in commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cutting plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares for approximately £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with crashing commodity prices as a slowdown in China’s economy strains demand and causes disaster in all markets.
The new listing raised the value of Glencore’s shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning trading.
The stock rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pennies on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced a $2.5 billion deal last week as part of a broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold its new share capital for 125 pennies a share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, with a total value of 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about China’s long-lasting slowdown in growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20-40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement released on Tuesday.
Xi’s first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing last November.
U.S. President and President’s wife, Michelle Obama, will arrange dinner for X and his wife, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, and at the same time will give President Obama and President X an opportunity to discuss constructively on issues where there are disagreements,” the statement said.
During the visit, which was first announced in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with numerous U.S. technology leaders before he continues to New York City and the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and the country’s increased absolute status in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes a difference in the movie.
Matt Damon met with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
In HBO's Sunday evening episode of Project Greenlight, the experienced actor interrupted Brown's speech by stressing the need for different perspectives as to the dark-haired protagonist of the screenplay selected for the project.
“When we talk about diversity, it’s taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series,” Damon argued.
Shocked, Brown reacted unbelievably, commenting, “Oh! Wow. Okay,” while The Martians’ actor’s comments were hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
“I want to encourage people to think, no matter who the director is, about how they treat the Harmony character,” Brown said.
The only dark character is a prostitute who is beaten by his white mate.
The producer of The Dear White People claimed the film’s directing rights to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied sadly that their directing “could end up giving us something we don’t want.”
After the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded to reproach Damon’s comments.
Mr Pooni, a Twitter user, said: “Matt Damon speaking to the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts.”
After its publication, Twiittaus collected more than 5000 re-citations and 4000 likes.
Damon’s comments hit a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After white police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to end practices that discriminate against people of color.
In February, Prince referred to the broadcast when nominating the Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Award.
“The albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently issued a statement in response to the Fox News television character Elisabeth Hasselbecki’s question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was recently that Damon is among the entertainers, producers, and media mobs who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion Crowned
Professional climber and dishwasher Isaac Caldier became on Monday the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and won the $1 million main prize.
In the competition program that just ended its seventh season, there has never been a competitor who would have survived all the parts of the program’s runway.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last mission was to climb a rope of about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to solve the exhausting fourth part of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after the hard-to-do win and was still shocked to win the $1 million main prize.
“So it’s great to think of this, since I’ve never earned or lived for less than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big pay raise.
So suddenly... I can’t even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
Producer Kent Weed sat down to talk to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten didn’t get more prize money, even though he was the first competitor ever to cross the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, the money will be given to the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don’t think he feels sorry for that.
He is so happy that he has done what he has done.
His fans have praised him.
He is a great guy and a good family father.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If somebody had to beat me, I’m happy that it was Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would have thought the same thing if it had been the opposite.
American Ninja Warrior is set to return for the eighth season, which will start shooting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season has not been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their role perfectly on Tuesday when they beat the Minnesota Twins on the 5-4 Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to climb the game half-end from the Houston Astros in a competition for another place in the American League wild card.
For Detroit, the game was for at least one night a return to the six-letter H-word, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the second half of the season.
“All winnings are fun, no matter how they get,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support as Detroit ran three times in the first two twists, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) scored 6 in a turning pair and dropped three runs.
This was his third record in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong ending for this year,” Simon said.
It’s difficult for the switcher to enter every game, and that’s why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitutes Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first hits in the run since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first night of three beats since he hit four times against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He swung the goal well,” Ausmus said.
He looked good (in stroke exercises), looked much better in stroke exercises, and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh twist, and it was their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the twist by knocking out the left field line twice.
Right-handed Aaron Hicks returned home with a sting of one nest, and Simon burned the other nest player, Brian Dozier, directly before Simon was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked alongside Mauer, the only player to stand against, the beginner replacement player Miguel Sano, who scored a two-bed run to the left of his right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the pitch and the leveling runners on the second hand, VerHagen got the three-seat Trevor Plouffe to hit the goal leading to the double game.
It was the main record: the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had gotten a safety run at the ninth start, Mauer scored two beaten runs against the Tigers closer Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three feeds in his fifth rescue.
Detroit initially took advantage of Phil Hughes.
The Tigers made three runs in the first two pairs against a right-handed veteran who escaped from the list of injured before the game after being out for more than a month due to lower back inflammation.
“It’s obvious that I didn’t want this kind of start,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I had a few nice feeds done on the third twist.”
After Hughes grabbed the start-up to the first nest, he let the second nest player Ian Kinsler advance one in between.
J.D. Martinez’s right-hand walk in the situation of two fires brought Victor Martinez to the point, who took himself to the first place in the midfield and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 pipes while the runners were in good positions.
Three-seat player Nick Castellanos continued to hit the right and cause a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was dropped as he attempted to advance to the three-seat.
The Tigers went on with a second pair and got one fire, a two-bed run from kidnapper James McCann and a two-bed run from center Anthony Gossel, after which the situation was 3-0.
“It was an important blow,” Twins team manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn’t hit very well, but he flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to be in the feed reading and feeds a non-running third pair, after which he was replaced by the right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs out of six beats and a walk on four fires.
NOTE: Tigers' right-handed feeder Anibal Sanchez was dropped due to a stretch in the shoulder.
He is being investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured since mid-August for a shoulder stroke, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed feed Daniel Norris comes out of the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris's statistics in the Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed feeder David Price was replaced with him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a stretching of the right belly muscle.
The three-game series of Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota's right-hander, Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open up the economy to the world
The economy needs to be more open to the outside world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to guide the reform.
“China should commit to attracting foreign finance and expertise and developing a policy of transparency,” he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the Leadership Group on Deepening Reform.
Supporting transparency while reforms are being pushed forward will add new movement and vitality, as well as create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting market access, easing border controls, urging state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
A negative list will be created, naming the sectors and companies that should not be invested in.
The system is being gradually tested and improved through experimental programs.
The change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a law-based business environment and makes the market more transparent.
The government will also loosen its control over the power it shares with the companies, thus ensuring that the companies themselves decide how to conduct their business.
China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up sectors controlled by the state to private financiers, more sectors will open up.
“The government will not change its approach to foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent residence permits for foreigners, “green cards”, will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the rights of lawyers to practice and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
