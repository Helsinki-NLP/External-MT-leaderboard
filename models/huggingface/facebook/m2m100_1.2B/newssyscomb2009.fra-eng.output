Right-wing populists win in Austria, they have 29 percent of the total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a sensitive weakening of the two parties forming the current big coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the votes, the country’s leading political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost nine percent of the votes, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the popular party, which triggered early elections, the outcome is literally catastrophic.
Even in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable advance over the SPÖ.
But voters clearly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and current deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer, were pronounced.
Observers estimate that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party’s leadership.
Such an evolution would facilitate a priori the way to the outcome of the election which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the large coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties – the Free Party (FPÖ) would have won 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes – the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the People’s Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated) on a common government, which even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to collaborate with any party and that he planned to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently based on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but these lost slightly and fell, among the Austrian political parties, from third to fifth position.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four percent threshold and entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are at risk
If the problem of Czech researchers accused in India of illegally harvesting cockroaches is not resolved, it would follow, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, held following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, out of the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He noted, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from charges and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the matter being placed under the jurisdiction of the central government.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could ask for caution and wait for judgment in freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed himself in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way that the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such aid had already been provided to them also from India.
“We want, above all, to maintain the best relations with India, which have a long-standing tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem that has arisen to the Czech entomologies.
“We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a big misunderstanding,” he said.
The minister avoided the question of whether he had obtained from India the promise to deal with the matter.
“I have already received a fairly large number of promises,” he only notes.
A Czech arbiter arbitrates the battle for the seabed
It approaches an electronic wall map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area, however, is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the United Nations Division for Oceans and Sea Law.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardor at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world so far unknown, rich in natural resources.
There can be found oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A deeper bottom than the firm earth
The coastal states have now begun to aspire to new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they use their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
For simplification, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone," Mikulka explains.
The request that the country concerned submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous expensive prospecting and metrics.
This is the result of several years of preparatory work.
“One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the Commission has handled five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia’s success, which is the first to significantly expand its submarine possessions, has recently experienced a global echo.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the size of the seabed, which the commission awarded it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, representing the country's size multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospects.
The profits they will get in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will be, as they project, invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of having ratified the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the ocean floor area, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
No country has an exclusive position anymore.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
“H, let’s not go wrong, the seabed is not a Klondike,” said Mikulka, adding that “their areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract.”
Czechs in the Pacific
A portion of the sea floor now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc in the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, in accordance with the Convention, it, as well as investors from a few other States, obtained the status of a so-called "pioneering investor".
It has extraction rights in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is moved there, it is a kind of submarine replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a field rich in polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such concreation.
It reminds of a little potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had sought help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are being revealed.
According to indications from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defense, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists from the federal army and officials from the GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the site of the release.
As the ministry spokesman communicated on Monday night, the German forces were ultimately not required, as the hostages released their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of a forceful release.
The Egyptian government had accepted the help offered by Germany to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
“Fortunately, this has not happened until then,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After being abducted in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transported to the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has so far remained vague, as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were rescued arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not disclose the details of the release.
At the moment, no information has been given about the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five vacationers and special forces are expected to take off on board an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue plan
The first house of the U.S. Congress failed the $700 billion bailout plan.
The Dow Jones fell to the bottom.
With 227 votes against 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout plan.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to stifle the chaos of the financial markets failed to get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded of this heavy $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MEPs to vote in favour though the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the investor’s concern that the state bailout plan could overturn.
It went back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts now project new serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval and the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of reservations for the coming months, according to one study, turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak economic outlook, German travel thirst remains insatiable, according to this study.
In terms of reservations for the winter season, the travel agencies registered a turnover of more than 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, rising bookings already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have climbed to about 11 percent more compared to 2007, DRV believed.
The sources of these findings are the figures from GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 will be registered there.
Due to the low rate of the dollar, travel to the US would be in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
Besides that, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our land would be sought-after destinations by the Germans.
Particularly organized trips are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be here "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with discounts on early booking or All Inclusive deals, Laepple said.
The summer months were also highly held so that sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year – although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip dropped compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer festival.
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in litre pitches and celebrities in Tyrol costumes of designer.
An event at the Beer Festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a tailor-made Tyrol costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is of occasion.
But one thing connects us: only three minutes to the beer party, and already photographers throw on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this at my first visit to the beer party.
This is how you make friends.
The cheap Tyrol costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Theresia Square, everything is half worse.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a tyrol costume or leather pants; no one looks blasphemed or affected by shame - this is completely normal.
Only the blanket of my Tyrol costume gathers a few bizarre eye shots at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out to me that I would have wrongly attached my blanket: "left means free, in the middle virgin, on the right housewife, on the back widow."
Discreetly, I tripatouillate my loop from the back to the left.
“It’s better,” she said and laughed.
Others don’t get as bad for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple feutres, on which it is written “Too drunk to get dressed!” and exposes us to their naked backpack without being invited.
The exhibitionist young man is named Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds it “gorgeous”, with a “ooooo” lying down.
He told me all this after relieving himself from the cup he had drank before.
Right next to that burning mouth that everyone thinks is a rubbish.
Bob is therefore one of those sadly famous "wild frogs".
Others are not lucky to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, rescue groups run to the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses rather intervene in a mob – always by four, they drag their tent-covered cavernous into tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer party: we go there empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the beaten under the beam are not visible.
“These are those who can no longer swallow anything,” one of the rescuers cried out to me in response to my question and then disappeared in the mess.
Accident victim identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released under caution.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate its backland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps from Asia, is one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a Neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its angles, like some German provincial councils.
The stones are dirty.
The entire building is in ruins.
But once inside the curved ticket office, we no longer have any doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, backward to imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad and the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of the surrounding region, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and Empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, immersed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway passage to Anatolia and all the eastern points serves—at least symbolically—to emphasize Turkey’s expanding diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed wagon toward the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour journey, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital-presented as a new city of a century-old new state, turning the back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots represents an example of changing the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built in stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and numerous pastry stores where middle managers in costume-cravate-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Dress, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
The aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its backland.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case with either.
She had to do both.
But at some point, “I asked if Turkey shouldn’t choose?”
“Turkey,” he said, “does not want to have to choose between the two.”
He then highlighted one aspect that almost everyone I was able to talk to recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway does not only go to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore, both an advantage for Europe and the United States and for Turkey itself.
With Turkey’s integration, the message seems to draw a Europe metaphorically traveling on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the station of Hydarpasha, after another night without sleep, I reconsidered those two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in Turkey’s hands.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey was called “the sick of Europe.”
At least, there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories by Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Musical Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Having already started his musical project for the city, he founded the following year the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the choir's will and skill to manage any type of music presented to him, whether madrigal or messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod repeated us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He would have said, “The composer knows what he wants.”
Everything is there, in music.
So sing it!”
His stick technique was absolutely clear, precise, though never dictatorial or apparent.
Regardless of the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver was to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well from 1962 to 1982, when he was leading the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I’ve seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me—and sometimes they have even inspired me.
Tod Handley held such a rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, “focused only on certain people.”
It will be missing many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (died on September 25) states that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and became in 1950, member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, a MA and a PhD."
This is what comes from Woodruff's author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s he studied in the United States at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "The Flamenco and the Life" because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
It’s a show that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second strike for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz.
While its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
A change in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz features a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are many.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the launch of the first generation.
First, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a selling phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, one million Honda Jazz cars have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years represents is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which accounts for 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
The head of the Spanish subsidiary hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to cope largely with the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand’s leaders hope to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, or 4,000 cars less than in 2007, or a 16% decline in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also expects to gain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door and compact-sized hybrid - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to sell 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five inches more), its width is 1.69 meters (two inches more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five inches.
On the other hand, the height does not change either 1.52 meters.
The size increases, and the interior as well.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a fuel reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk – which has a dual back system – can hold up to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the first-generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the 1.2L Honda Jazz is 379 liters.
The other innovation – in addition to the exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof – is improved access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened at a angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of the Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2- and 1.4-litre gasoline engines.
Both engines are equipped with i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine power.
The first 1.2 litre engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4900 rpm.
This propeller – which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reached 100 horsepower.
This 100 horsepower 1.4L Honda Jazz has a combined fuel consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘bee car’ that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accidents prevention technologies, Nissan inspired itself, this time, from nature, especially bees.
A Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at the Advanced Technical Center at Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Chief Public Relations Officer for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of Nissan’s safety shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal space in an oval shape that resembles Nissan’s safety shield.
But the most important are the eyes composed of the bee, able to see from an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly uninterruptedly inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what is known as a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles at a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“When it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by twisting its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it, and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
“Each second this device only has to process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logic of pre-maneuvering, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
It may be surprising, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into production cars in about a decade, according to Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid to be mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not lacking in geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn how not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
It means “The Hotel of Bad Credits” ... or Stories.
The ugly appearance of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master makes us think repeatedly if this is the right time to apply for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it.
It is certain that this game provides useful but not detailed information.
This is a game for teenagers.
What to do when the game ends?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It’s better than nothing, because it’s unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley to Invest in MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, to take over $9 billion to take 21 percent of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock market.
A week after revealing a provisional deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The price held is 19% lower than the booked value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities, providing a 10% return and a $31.25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, which is 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley shares, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 5 p.m.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow it to diversify its operations but puts it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: Last Monday, Morgan simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” said Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s chief executive, “we thought the participation would be entirely ordinary shares.
But given the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of profit per share.
The agreement stipulates that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares within one year if they trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that MUFG’s capital will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to give details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he has "significantly" eased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock price melt by half as the cost of insurance against default risk on its debt dropped.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch’s acquisition, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Re-founding the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, along with his counterparts and friends, it was the third time that a draft of a new Constitution was put to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the “no” received 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft constitution to be passed, it needed half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed in the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his constitution.
“The Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians on the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales as well as his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place quietly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), dealt with a text of 444 points consolidating the “new socialism” defended by the president.
The draft constitution dedicates the state’s power over the economy, reserving to it the “development planning” of a country that lives essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants enhanced powers to the head of state, who will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and fight for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. drug operations.
Thirteen hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight accompanies captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived around 15:30 a.m. on a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, which is located at Cairo’s international airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, by helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo examinations.
They are in "good health" and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been bullied from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces members, dispatched on board two helicopters, launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
“An exchange of shots took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing,” said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the lightning unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our intelligence men, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle with the kidnappers on board during a patrol, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
So much better.
But a part of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros on restoring the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and this, in concert.
In Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with researching history, preserving private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and policymakers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When is a history and heritage tribune?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level on the matter, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has intensified in more than a year, is for the bank Fortis.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back half (up to 49%) of the bank’s capital located in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell a portion of its shares, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis stocks began a dizzying drop.In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed in the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company’s shares fell 12 percent, reaching its lowest level in 14 years.
Since January, the stock has fallen by more than two-thirds of its value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital is around €14 billion, which, according to the company’s executives, is unrealistic.
The company's management accuses overseas uncertainty, related to the adoption of the US $700 billion bailout plan, of being the cause of the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the prices increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed chairman of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the substance.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s clientele circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken.
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about his or her purchases of medicines.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There are data protection programs that bind the use of prescription information, in all cases, to the consent of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting your chicken to a fox,” Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and insured capital in case of damage dependent on the customer’s health condition, and if they consider the risk too high, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after learning about the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily provides himself with pharmacies, data on the person's purchase of medicines in the past eighteen months.
For example, if that person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts him in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine a risk coefficient at the same time, so there is not much more to do to the insurer except paperwork.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes.For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat strokes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is seen by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have grown in data research and analysis, and they must ask for permission from the patient before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their faults in the past.
Recently, some companies are also processing the results of laboratory analyses, and linking them with data on drug consumption.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on medical data protection, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill expanding the circle of authorities’ control over companies specializing in data provision is currently in Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive consent of the data subject.
This is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he or she refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus, and ultimately, the chickens depend on the fox’s kindness.
The overall menu of Marseille
The EU and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trade partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global issues.
There will also be a summit between France and India on nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union recognizes that India is a major emerging democratic power that should be given wider voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support to New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not delay this issue at the ninth summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current president of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Foreign Affairs, Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonised the 26 bilateral conventions with India concerning civil flights.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to accelerate the negotiations.
The goal is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU’s largest trading partner, and, on the other hand, New Delhi, which ranks only ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on this subject was discussed.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains loyal to its energy and climate agenda, including that it wants to reduce its emissions of toxic materials by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need to pass a global market at next year’s climate conference, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The head of state of India is travelling to the French capital, where during a bilateral meeting, he prepares to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, French companies are expected to receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the news agency, the deal would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian editors at the Frankfurt International Book Show.
More than 300 Italian publishers attended the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as the guest of honor.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting in the Room Struktur, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authorship books is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
The plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago, has been found.
The remains of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3,000 meters in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dismissed the remaining doubts: "The plane was localized, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is indeed the one on which Steve Fosset was traveling the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or around the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) said hours after the detection of the wreckage, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal items were found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash cash and a pull.
Fossett's search was stopped a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In 2002, he became the first man to complete the world round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled around the world by plane and without a stop.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
This is the advertisement you don’t expect.
An unusual 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the latest born of the off-road "compact" of the star's house, with whom Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Just because of its non-standard content, unexpected and unconventional will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17 next.
Thus, the advertising beat that will accompany the launch of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the heart of Milan’s shopping center, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication includes the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, you will have the impression that when you look at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to spots, in all its details, to then recompose into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula in attracting the interest of future buyers?
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 young boys and girls whom Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the "Ultras Italy" group that has followed the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created major problems.
He had never met the adversaries.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolor flags on which their hometown appeared: Saturday night, they were all abducted so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English style.
In Bulgaria, they found a fancy of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact controlled them all: among those who went to Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal awaits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years.
A Daspo international that prohibits visiting the Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot on the stadium.
and fortunately.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is, others are at risk of joining the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves this way," Viminal said.
So, "keep the eyes well open especially ahead of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small core of fans of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms which can even rely on a section of the Aise, that is, secret services, which are dealing precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the stretched arm during the hymn of Mameli? in Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste, where a fan base of the group Ultras Italy, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 tifosis was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see well what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about whispers toward Mameli’s anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite.”
