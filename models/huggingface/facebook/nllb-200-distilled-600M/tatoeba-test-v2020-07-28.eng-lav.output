There's a problem.
The dog is close to death.
Let's have lunch.
How long have you been living in Tokyo?

She gets paid a lot.
I drink to relax.
Please give me another chance.
I'll set you free.
Please give me that.
He plays piano.
Tom has an eclectic taste in music.
There's a girl in this room.
He has problems.

Tom won't stay.
I saw it from the window.
It's time to go to school.
The white boat went down the stream.
We had to wait for him for ten minutes.
He gave him a book.
What did you answer?
Books are the bees that carry pollen from one mind to another.
She's very open.
It's good now; neither too heavy nor too light.

The Captain, his whore, women and children first!

Tom smiling.
We're still nervous.
He only screams when he's hungry.
I'll set you free.

n't had to go, but I did.
Puts it up your ass.
I know what I'll do.
n't have a horse.

If you visit Tom right now, he's probably just watching TV.
Mari and Maki are sisters.

I have a horse.

She's my muse.
It's a compliment.
I am Ricardo.
Please lock the safe.
I have a white cat.
Tom ne va pas nous trouver.
Tell me what you find out.
Où est le chat?
I no longer live in Boston.
I see you had your homework ready before dinner.
It's a conspiracy.

There are two girls in the playground.
You don't work here.
She sat on the bed as her mother braided her hair.
I go to school by metro.
I am sorry you feel that way.
Tom cut the wrong wire.
She came along.
We should protect the forest.

Have you noticed anything suspicious?
Mens heart is about as big as his fist.
There are islands in the sea.
Never write the words "bortsch" and "shchi" in German!
What's happened?
Tom never was very friendly with Mary.
Your daughters are beautiful.

How could you be so sure?
n't have a spare shirt.
I waited for fifteen minutes.
You'll stay here.
I had intended to go shopping.
Tom plays guitar almost as well as Mary does.
When I got home, I had a nice, ice cold shower.
He hid behind the door.
I am worried for you.
Tom se tagay.

I don't like punk rock at all.
I pray that you will have the best of luck.
Tom nežije tu.
I want you to know that I love you.
Onyezioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

I need to feed my dog.

She's two years younger than me.
We have to be very careful.
