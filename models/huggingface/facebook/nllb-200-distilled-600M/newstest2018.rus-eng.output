Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on imposing administrative responsibility for violating the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) when purchasing for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of their obligations by customers when carrying out state and municipal purchases.
Two years ago, the situation was widespread when entrepreneurs could not get paid for their public and municipal contracts.
At the same time, the Russian president instructed the Russian General Prosecutor's Office to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unfaithful customers who signed contracts not backed by financing, tried to evade their payment obligations and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment by public orders, the prosecutor's office has submitted 9,7 thousand submissions, as a result of their consideration, 4,5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, and administrative - 533 - 75 documents have been submitted to the investigatory bodies for the organization of procedural checks, 46 of which have been brought to trial.
As a result, the debts of over 66 billion rubles were paid off to the entrepreneurs.
And these huge sums of money were not built up by the failure to pay off multi-billion dollar contracts.
The basic debts were accompanied by numerous, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs at much more modest amounts.
This is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for social transportation services for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not get the money due on time.
The result is a growing financial debt of wages, taxes, loans that would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not turned to the prosecutor's office for help.
Now, in some regions, the problem has been leveled to the maximum.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, as identified by prosecutors of the Russian Federation's subjects, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt levels continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor's office operates in a manual crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor General shall personally hold meetings with local authorities, where all violations discovered by the prosecutors are examined and measures taken to remedy them are taken.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal law No 189-FZ "On amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences in the area of determining administrative responsibility of the officials of the customer for violation of the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) during procurement to provide state and municipal needs" will be able to improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General.
The new law will be supplemented by an article of the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services by a public and municipal purchases by an official of the customer.
If the official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation's subjects have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novelties in practice.
Civil rights group announces a travel warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racial slurs.
The group's statement reads: The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Travel Admonition, valid through August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, guests, and citizens of the state of Missouri to be especially vigilant and to exercise increased caution when traveling through the state in connection with a number of suspicious incidents on racist soil that have recently taken place throughout the state and brought here.
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the announcement of a group movement warning was prompted by a recent Missouri law that made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and the fact that state law enforcement disproportionately often elects minority groups as their target.
People are being violated in your country.
They're stopped on the roads because of their skin color, beaten and killed, said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, to the Kansas City Gazette.
We hear complaints more often than ever before.
This is the first such warning the organization has issued to the U.S.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on the grounds of race at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while on a state tour, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charge.
The warning also mentions a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office that says black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
People should be prepared to take the money with them or tell their relatives they're traveling across the state.
According to the latest FBI hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, making the state the 16th largest state in the nation.
The move warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to sue a legal entity over housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for travelers in Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration control laws that required local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said should have increased racial background checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in a shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknowns shot down a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports, citing Egypt's Interior Ministry.
Two people, including a policeman, were killed and three others were injured in the shooting.
All the wounded have been taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two gunmen in the car opened fire on the law enforcement.
One of the attackers was arrested, the other managed to escape.
Rosturism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-return air tickets
Head of Rosturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC TV that he was "positively" about the adoption of the law on the abolition of free luggage transportation on non-return air tickets.
"We need to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than a person who has luggage", he said.
Mr. Safonov noted that despite the concerns of citizens, there will be no need to pay for carrying upper clothes and mobile phones in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to declare this, to say that it will not be related to top clothes, umbrella, mobile phone, iPad or even some computer", said the head of Rosturism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that provides for the right of airlines to exclude the norm of free carrying of luggage on non-returning air tickets.
The airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-returnable fare.
Vladimir Putin has ordered to eliminate pollution in Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the protection of the Baikal Sea that in recent years, large areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He ordered the sources of funding, plans and executors to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered a full restoration of the contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the cleaning facilities of most of them are worn out", - quotes RIA Novosti president.
He also added that the Russian Prosecutor General's Office should conduct a check to identify environmental harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the lake area related to the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by recreation organizers.
"I want to emphasize that not everyone should be checked, but the measures must be known, and that is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and appropriate measures should be taken", he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed increasing the number of facilities subject to environmental oversight.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin during a direct line stated the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living on natural areas of special protection regime.
He was informed of problems with the management of the farm by the residents of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the Buryatia government reminded that such a change is not enough, as the restrictions are linked to a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will be built in the Ugra
In the village of Sosya, members of the community from the representatives of the indigenous peoples of the North "Rahtynia", together with the residents of the Berezov district, participate in the construction of the Orthodox church in honor of the saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is on the river bank, the temple will be well visible from a distance, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, the dome is now installed, church bells are available.
The Iranian Navy's REB provided transportation.
The temple is named after Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, who is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sousse, fishing gives the settlers jobs and feeds them.
Local people are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school papers as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore follow the laws?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while carefully storing the cigarettes in an iron box he has taken from his office.
After the conversation, the businessman heads to the nearest urn - a hundred yards away - and throws bulls in.
The fine for garbage in a public place is $500 local, Chang said.
You know, I've had this reflex since I was a kid: You can't throw a candy bar over a bridge, you're gonna get fined.
And now, there are cameras everywhere.
And indeed, the alleys in Singapore's city centre are as clean as a museum.
Chang says that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son drew graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a life sentence.
What?!
I mean, imagine that.
He got ten blows with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in jail.
Corporal punishment is not uncommon.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and the most severe laws, the AIF's observer was on the scene.
"No one here is thinking about abolishing the death penalty", explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long cared about the opinion of both the EU and the US on this issue.
If a person is carrying a large batch of drugs or is selling them, he's got a hangover.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian man was arrested at Changi airport carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian prime minister, threatened with sanctions, international human rights defenders, and even Pope Francis.
But the guy ended up hanged anyway.
After that, drug dealers are trying to get around our country.
The thing is, in Singapore, the law is for everyone to follow, not just the poor and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are, millionaire, vice prime minister, famous artist or European Union resident.
The only option in this case is if you get a half a dozen cocaine, you're hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you see signs with a bunch of warnings, you're just amazed at how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly (!) by a doctor's prescription.
Tourists will not be given a chewing gum on arrival, but if you stick a "cough" to the subway, you'll be fined 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two men with white plates on their necks saying, "I've trashed".
For a cigarette butcher who is thrown out of the urn, the penalty is often "sending him to the yard", which is cleaning up parks and beaches for a week.
6 thousand rubles is paid by a "criminal" who forgot to wash water in the public toilet, and when trying to cope with a small need in the elevator of a residential house, a special detector is activated - doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Exotic laws include banning pigeons from feeding on the street, public singing and even excessive watering of indoor plants (!).
To avoid fires, smokers cannot carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
So, the idea is, no matter how hard you try, you're bound to break something.
It's not true, says Mohammed Kabir-Kajari, the owner of a local travel agency.
The most fantastic laws exist only on paper, and I haven't seen anyone get caught breaking them in the last 20 years.
Why are they kept?
So the citizens don't relax.
The basic rules are closely monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes at a kiosk, the owner of the store will pay a huge fine, the offender himself will be beaten with sticks in the "back" and the seller will also be kicked out and thrown in prison.
It is because of such strict laws that offenses are very rare in Singapore.
Is that justified?
Back in the '70s, we had a chaotic road system - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they pleased, drove drunk.
After the year-long fines, things have calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a slice of whiskey, knows that if stopped, the cop will not be released for bribery, will be fined the value of the apartment and sent to jail for years.
To many foreigners, a city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" - a US guest who was horrified by the wealth of its inhabitants, "a terribly clean airport" and "culturally beautiful nature".
It's just that these things are unnatural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be.
You're in Singapore for the first few days and you're really afraid to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you're just boasting if you've gotten on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India area, and suddenly, there's a pattern breaking: plastic glasses are falling off the bus stop.
"What is it?" you wonder.
And here's the Singaporean smile.
It's all happening.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know that if you are charged, you will not be punished for breaking the law.
Most often, that's enough to get a person to behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
I was very careful in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where motorcyclists often grab smartphones and cameras from tourists' hands.
Downtown Paris is full of dirty bombs and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets tries to throw trash in the bin, either.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, cleanest, and safest city on earth because of its string of draconian fines and ruthless laws (up to and including the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
That's human nature, remember, in Russia, nobody was strapped behind the wheel until they were fined.
Although, in Singapore, the main thing is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the law.
And think about it, we in Russia would be happy to have clean streets, no garbage in the subway and welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's the corporal punishment. Thank you.
Otherwise, Singapore's laws are worth looking at.
Nothing holy?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
The Americans understand this no worse than anyone else - hence the deliberate demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he put a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a heated debate with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try to hit the statue itself.
Half the owners of cruise ships and the artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do it.
But he was trying to capture its meaning, and especially the meaning that was ascribed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller exclaimed at Acosta: "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current sound of the amazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not just any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of breathing free, / the unfortunate waste of your abundant shores".
Never before have we seen "unfortunate waste" so clearly on our screens.
Miller wasn't literary - he made it clear that Trump's not what people expect in America.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it's really about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to put her words on the base of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to represent the connection between the French and American republics using a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: the Exiled Mother.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right at least change it back.
The loudmouthed Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist who announced Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather she is an early neoconservative who carries the flame of America in the dark world: "Freedom goes forward.
She carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
A torch is not needed to light the way to the United States".
Contrary to what we've been told, Limbo has really hit the spot.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the angle of view.
Lazarus' greatest achievement was to see her as tired, unhappy, but hopeful people on decks after a long and often difficult voyage.
It literally means looking at the world through the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue is answered with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not needed to light the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake gives a high rating to the Scottish national team.
Elid Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team.
Neil Blake, director of the UK Athletics Federation, said the 16-man Scottish team at the World Cup would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships, which will begin on Friday.
Blake believes that Scotland is "born something special" and the British Athletics Federation should take that into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and we're going to support them as long as they have the potential", Blake said.
"I've been talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they think it's because of what they've done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks what they've done needs to work.
The British Athletics Federation: What they've done, we have to work with.
And people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why this is happening, but it's brilliant".
Some of the Scottish lightweight athletes are bidding for medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farha in the 5000m; and Elid Doyle has been chosen as team captain.
"Helid is humble.
"She gave a great captain's speech", says Blake.
"Many athletes, whether Scots or not, wherever they live or train, have left this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and heartfelt feelings that Elid put into it were remarkable".
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will run the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says the 16 Scots in the British team are "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
First comes Laura Moore, who specializes in middle distance running and broke five British and two European records last year.
She'll run for 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will compete in the 1500m, is another Scottish man to watch out for: behind his back, he has had a successful season, winning both the British national team and the annual competition.
Doyle recalls her first World Cup when the only Scottish member of the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only made the national team, but in some cases will be competing for medals and reaching the final.
"The captain is chosen by other team members, so it was a huge honor anyway, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you is a very special thing for me", she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who have made the team.
It shows how much we've accomplished.
And they're all well-rounded athletes who will strive to make it to the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed we're very lucky to host the World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get the support of the fans and take advantage of being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go out there and compete, and the atmosphere is going to be just great".
Blocking Facebook critics: Don't run for public office if you're not ready to hear criticism from voters
The founder of our country knew what critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't shut his critics up.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "We can take away freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughter".
Now I'm going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit insignificant, and the online commentary was written in the spirit of "well, what".
"It's just Facebook", many will say.
But it's also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a Democratic-majority state.
He's second in the approval ratings among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn jet.
He has shown a firm hand in running the state and his commitment to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as his primary way of communicating with his constituents and jokingly shows off his bald head after chemotherapy on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page -- which is declared an official public forum and run by administration employees for taxpayer money -- is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, press secretary Amelia Chase defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was simply moderating them.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and hackers who are malicious on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people that Hogan had blocked.
And it's real people, not trolls, teachers, businessmen, pastors, who turn to their chosen leaders.
All of them say their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted from the Bible, referring to Hogan's Catholicness.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed that he was not responding to hate crimes and other recent news", she wrote in the Post's comment section.
"I also dislike the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some people immediately say it's a so-called "snapshot" instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of unhappy citizens".
What the governor's subordinates call "a concentrated spam attack", others would probably call "an active life position".
In the age of Facebook, it's easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It's a lot less dusty than before, when it took people to send in, gather and burn critical newspapers, or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in numbers.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, most radical decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria U.S. District Judge James K. Casheris, the county board chairman Laudon violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from his Facecbook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It's not gonna be that hard.
In Washington, D.C., the era of affordable mail was about as revolutionary as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letter writers severely undermined its authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People with the aliases "Uricola", "Valerius", "Belisaarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Documents online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech is at the heart of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing with that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home in the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for a comfortable living for the next three days when the East Lothian club Renaissance will host the twenty-fifth Scottish Open golf tournament for older athletes.
The Northern Irish native, who led the neighbourhood at Archerfield Links, and was on his way to the final round last year before losing to Paul Ilsa, is attached to the new venue and acts as the tournament representative on behalf of the club's founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.
I've seen the Renaissance Club build, and we're seeing it succeed with this event", said Rafferty.
Players will see this field at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry did a great job of setting this place up.
He's a big fan of the game and proud of his accomplishments here.
It's a great demonstration for this field.
Englishman Ils is looking forward to defending his first championship title, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling", said the Southport player.
I couldn't try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It's magical to be back in this corner of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon, it was a very special feeling to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we'll always remember it.
Returning to his hometown Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year.
This will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important", said Hellenborough Orr.
You want to perform well, but you feel it's an extra burden.
I was happy to play again, and I showed you good golf.
I'm happy with the way things are going so far.
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnem and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmeyer and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free, and parking costs £5 per hour for one person in the car and £10 for two or more.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Some of the tunnels above the highways that can absorb carbon dioxide from cars are already being tested on Britain's roads.
The country's transport agency, Autocar reports, reported positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is made of some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances from automobile exhaust.
However, the creation of a network of tunnels is only part of the large scale measures the UK authorities are planning to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are planning to expand the network of electric vehicle charging stations, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial electric transport and modernize the heavy-duty truck fleet.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transportation, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
The Moscow court changed the sentence of the disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow court changed the sentence of the disabled Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in a colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the sentence with a conditional one, explaining its request that Mamayev's illness "precludes him from being in prison".
Anton Mamayev, 28, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with a sentence of life in a general colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former fighter of the special forces.
On July 19, a court in the SIZO released a man from custody.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's golden land
When I cook lunch, Bardina DeGea doesn't use a stove.
She's not even a potty.
In her wooden house in Enoratali, the capital of Panay County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, called notata, right in the stove.
In half an hour, the burned club is removed and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
DeGee sits on the ground floor, she has no furniture, and it's where she does her housework, like washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she was not assigned to work in the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after five o'clock", she says.
It's a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the high mountains of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enoratali is as remote as it is abandoned; the road to this city includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jaipur, the administrative centre of the province, to Nabir, and then a five-hour drive by rental car.
There's no public transportation here.
The town of about 19,000 people is made up of wooden houses with bamboo fences; the roofs of the town are made of corrugated steel and are painted with rust in various reddish shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners have been here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans worshiped a god named Ug Tamie.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", DeGea says, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
Previously on the body we only carried leaves.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based company Freeport McMoran, is located just sixty miles from Panay, a mountainous province about the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua boasts of forest reserves estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, bring a single disaster for the Papuan people, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 to an officer.
The demands for greater autonomy from the papuas threaten the existence of this golden dwelling and are being relentlessly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, more than 500,000 papuan have been killed by the Indonesian military, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We're losing everything, a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as sentences without trial, torture especially frequent, as another report claims, rape and electrocution and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week", says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The gaits have been delayed as Papua's resources have attracted the influx of migrants from other areas of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic changes as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese stalls, varung, sell fried chicken and a mixture of gado-gado vegetables served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than the native population of Papua, explains Abet Yow, a twenty-four-year-old Pania native who moved to Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, for work.
Because of this, the native population of Papua lost their market.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and human rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter sought the support of 27 of Papua's 29 counties, including Pania.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel loyal.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Djokovic, expecting him to live up to our hopes for justice", Yow says.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration of Djokovic, Paniay survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas carols at the Enorata fireplace when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle escaped from the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javed Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers shortly afterward.
Victims and witnesses said soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so badly that he slipped into a coma.
A couple hours later, someone set fire to the government election commission building nearby, and the next day, things got worse.
About a thousand Papuan men, women, and children gathered on a football field outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought ritual hunting bows and performed the Waiata, the dance of the Papuan tribe of Meia Pago: they ran in circles and depicted the song of birds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation got worse, the soldiers were given an order by internal radio: "If the mob resisted more than three times, shoot them", as stated in an official document seen by correspondents of TIME magazine, but not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremiah Kayame, head of the Kego Koto district in Enoratalia, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, appealing to the crowd to disperse around their homes.
No one wanted to hear him.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist", he told TIME magazine, standing on the front porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but he says the bullet came from a swarm of gathered soldiers.
There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots, he adds.
Alfius Yow was shot three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", Johannes told TIME magazine, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
I saw he was dead... I kissed him.
General Yotje Mende, the senior inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that his officers were only protecting their base because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Pujo Sulistio, a police spokesman for the Papua police, in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were wounded.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovic delivered a powerful speech in Jaipur, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic abuse of power in Papua.
I want this situation resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Viranto said he would set up a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights violations.
But they almost immediately gave me excuses.
Most of the violations have been committed for a long time.
Some of these were in the '90s or early '00s.
The fact is that we certainly want to address these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed", he said.
Viranto then retracted his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to establish an organization to handle complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided through the court".
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for independence of East Timor in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Paniay.
The families of the victims in Paniay greeted such statements with gloomy distrust.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but nothing has changed", says Johannes.
I'm tired of it.
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared", he says.
I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot.
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the people of Panay are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in Deia County, near Paniay.
During a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take a man who was unconscious to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a river nearby, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the construction site's office.
According to police, villagers threw stones at officers who fired warning shots in response.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we were afraid of retaliation", said Domingue Badias, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw the rush to deliver the wounded.
I was hiding at my house for two days.
The Deia's parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be called back from the region.
Panyai has always been a sick spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is a source of dissatisfaction among the Meia, Monni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green areas of central high mountains of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Free Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuan people by orchestrating sporadic attacks and kidnapping attacks on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM executives come from Paniay, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and unreasonably detained by the military in Panay in recent years under the pretext of defending national independence.
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua, Pania is considered a sad, forgotten place.
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enorata is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow everything they eat here: mostly notes, and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, each of whom can tend four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crops for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten club notes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality between the indigenous Papuan people and the new migrants who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabira airport increased.
The few available jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papayas rarely have the money or skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no work or money here", says John Gobai, chairman of the Panay Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua out of sight of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Eskudie and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for not being adequately coordinated with the relevant organizations despite receiving rare permits to film.
According to Felm Kine, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jockov's election campaign to lift restrictions on media to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa denial and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of media attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited by its immediate neighbors, Papua.
In March, six Pacific states  Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands  addressed the UN Human Rights Council with a request to investigate  diverse and widespread violations in Papua, including the shootings in Panay.
The same countries have backed OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramana Nasir refused the group's statement, telling journalists in Jakarta that Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations.
Local residents want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch ambassador for human rights, Keys Van Baar, visited Jaipur on May 4, the locals broke the silence, praying: "We want freedom", according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia is due to hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the papas say they are unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
"Jokovy is a man with good intentions, but he's surrounded by people involved in the Panay shooting", says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.
He wants Djokovic to know that the people of Pania, besides living in the shadow of the greedy army, are in poverty and their education and health care are in a pathetic state.
Gobai says that the people of Panay, like other papuan people, consider their vote for Djokovic a debt he must pay.
'They don't need money, they just want justice,' he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panja Shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly across from the police and military site.
Knowing that justice will probably never succeed, they will at least not let the guilty forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family", says Jacobus, without raising his head.
What else could we do?
Fire engulfs Dubai skyscraper for the second time
The fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of the 337-meter-high, seventy-nine-story structure.
This is the second fire to hit a high rise building that's been named a Torch in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no immediate news of the cause of the fire.
We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get off the 50th floor", a skyscraper resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defense Department, firefighters put out the fire around 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter to the victims.
The incident could bring back on the agenda the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
During an investigation by the administration of Fakela after the fire there in 2015, it was found that the most affected was the plaque  external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and the screening panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
Tourism in Idaho-Viruma in June has been at a minimum
According to data obtained by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists benefited from the services of the hotel enterprises of the North East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, while foreign tourists increased.
Foreign tourism increased by 7.3% (544 people) in June to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists has dropped by 3.2 percent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The most noticeable increase in the region was the number of Russian tourists - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida-Viruma hotels.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his Instagram followers who was to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he hasn't commented on the rumors, but today he posted a piece of an article in the newspaper Vedomosti for August 1.
Malakhov signed the tag "Boss milksucker".
The article discusses how to prevent a worker from "burning" and how to pay attention to his condition.
If you look back at the numerous reports that the host couldn't find a common language with the newly arrived producer who started to reformat "Let It Talk", it becomes clear what he was implying so clearly, writes "KP".
As reported, TV host Andrei Malakhov is currently on leave and has not signed a dismissal application from the First channel.
The situation with the dismissal may be clearer in the coming days.
Five soldiers killed in a car explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmend, RIA Novosti reports.
Police said a car exploded the night before near a military checkpoint in Girisk County.
There are 20 known dead.
There was another emergency in Girishka on Friday morning.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
The diver videotaped a shark biting his camera.
Diver and investigator Greg Skomal captured a video of a shark biting his GoPro action camera.
The footage was posted on Facebook by the Massachusetts Division of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which employs Skamal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeast of the United States, reports Necn.
A man tried to take the shark off a camera he was holding on a special stick while swimming underwater.
When I noticed a man, an animal over three meters long swam up to him.
The shark took a bite from the camera without attacking the scientist.
Skamal explained that the predator acted in a similar manner to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that this behavior of a marine animal was a novelty to scientists.
The cause of the mass fighting in the Ural military center became known
A task force of senior officers from the Central Military District arrived at the Yalan Training Center to investigate the incident.
Some details of the massacre have already been released.
According to Mash's publications on VKontakte, the contractors of the Ural Military Division No. 31612 fought violently over the uncontrolled bed.
It all started with a private named Sayan demonstratingly ignoring an officer's order to refuel the torch.
The officers of the sixth company joined the officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men broke their beds and sinks in the barracks, smashed their glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fighting.
The C.I.D. denied the information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one in five passengers in the United States carries prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items on board the plane through the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane with prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported later discovering that they had accidentally carried a firearm, ammunition, or explosives.
A study by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which involved more than 1,000 people, also found that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of those who admitted to knowingly trying to fly something that ATB prohibits, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
ATB employees are most often deliberately passed by by carrying food and water.
More than 3 percent admitted to having specifically taken sharp items through the examination, and 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted to knowingly carrying prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it had studied passengers across the country to find out how many had been smuggled through airport security by accident and how many were doing so deliberately.
It is expected that the most commonly smuggled persons - whether consciously or unconsciously - are those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of the ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what fluids they can carry or how much.
So it's no surprise that most of what ATBs pick up are prohibited liquids.
A while back, people thought that the ATB could ban the carrying of books.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt is refusing to postpone the implementation of Obama-era emissions reduction rules .
The day after the lawsuit was filed by 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay the implementation of Obama's rules to reduce emissions of air pollutants and smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency now, more than any previous administration, is listening to the needs of individual state environmental regulators.
He didn't mention the lawsuit against his previous position filed in the federal appeals court.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline for states to ensure compliance with 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "incompliance with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth".
Pruitt, who before being appointed to his current position by President Trump, was Oklahoma's attorney general, has long been known as a staunch opponent of environmental regulation.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations that were opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industries.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat for the course taken by Puyett to return to its old standards.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief had exceeded his authority to try to delay the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by drastically changing the course of ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA's obligation to cooperate with states in the complex process of timely enforcement of new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed deadlines in the course of settling the case", said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We don't believe in legal regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take our charter and the authority it gives us seriously".
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt may at some point reuse his "deferral powers and other statutory powers" to ensure that the rules "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House last month, seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of course - after our lawsuits - is a major victory in the fight for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that covers their cities", Schneiderman said.
The New York lawsuit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, oil refineries, and chemical plants and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting ability can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, resulting in thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental activists welcomed Prueitt's unexpected change of course.
"It's nice to think about how much pressure it took to take this perfectly logical step from a human being who was tasked with protecting the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Byrd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests".
IAAF Congress extended suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics (WFLA).
The congress thus supported the IAAF Air Force Restoration Council, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the removal remain in force.
166 voted in favor of the extension of the ban, 21 voted against.
The IAAF Council report said that the Air Force had made significant progress in achieving the conditions set by the Council for the restoration of membership, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the Air Force's disqualification at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 IAAF champions.
The Air Force was indefinitely disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
Then the report of independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) expert Dick Pound was published, which spoke of numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the IAAF Council's latest report in the "IAAF has extended sanctions against the Air Force".
The Offensive Defeat
In the 3rd round of the Russian Football League FONBET Championship among the teams, the newly formed Moscow "Khimik" played a home away match against the "Kaluga" Football Club.
A little over 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the game was a completely different picture.
The Chemistry didn't give up on the opponent, but the secondary relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After a recent 0-3 defeat by the Kałujans, many predicted a light victory for the masters.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the newcomers were forced to take their stand and acted from a defense, but from a position of strength.
In the first half, the Caloos built more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexey Sirotin, who repeatedly repelled dangerous strikes and gave confidence to his partners.
Unfortunately, the Chemistry attack lacked the effort and luck to put the Kalugi defense in a dead end and score the first goal on the way.
After the break, the game started on the opposite courses.
The Novosoviet were more active in the attack.
The alarming news for our team was the defensive errors that allowed the rookies to create a series of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the Chemic took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the rowers played a part - they were more literate and cold-blooded to finish, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, Chemistry moved the ball to the corner, which the owners of the field passed without resistance to the gate.
The goal was scored by Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, Chemistry showed a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
Our team is waiting for another outing - on August 11 at 19 in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Edward Streltsov, the newcomers will fight the favorite of the group "Center" of the "Ararat" FC, which includes Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come and support Chemic!
The meeting place and time of the newcomers is 18h 30 minutes near the Magnolia store (Eastern, d.2, corp.
The composition of the "Chemical" is: Sirotin, Manohin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khumout, Gogya (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, the Holy One, the Belyanin (Adoevs), Andreichenko (Lygin)
Press service of the club "Chimic"
According to the published decryption of the phone calls, Trump pressed Mexico about paying for the wall at the border.
The Washington Post published a decryption of phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned border wall.
The president of the United States scolded him for speaking out against the wall, and, according to leaks, told him, "You can't tell the press".
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
His first published phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a hot change.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the U.S. should take in refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous", "disgusting", and "stupid", and insisted that because of the deal the Obama administration had made, he would look like an idiot because he was going to stop the relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day.
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia tourists sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The plane belonging to the Russian airline, which has the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, flew from Sochi to St. Petersburg at 20:15 Moscow time, TASS reports.
At the final destination, the boarding station will be met by the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's municipality, Abkhazia's deputy minister for tourism and resorts Astamyr Ahba told reporters.
Earlier, the representatives of the Ministry of Emergencies of the republic said that all the expenses associated with the transportation of bodies back to Russia were borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Suhum intends to pay the families of the victims compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhazia leadership expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the victims of the blasts of the tourists to fly and stay in the republic, but the relatives sent only the trust certificates to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky in the Gudaut district, two explosions occurred at the missile and artillery armament warehouse of the Ministry of Defense of the republic, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition were detonated.
As a result, the warehouse burned down, causing uncontrolled explosions of various modifications.
As a result of the accident, two Russian citizens - Elena Polyakova of 1970 and Elena Timofeev of 1962 - died while on holiday near the hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of various degrees of severity were taken to the medical institutions of the republic.
There are currently seven people in the hospital, the rest have been discharged.
A grand jury will study Russian influence in the US election
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia's influence on the 2016 US presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to prosecute.
A grand jury summon gives Mueller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the jury's investigation, which began a few weeks ago, will be details of the meeting of Donald Trump's son, then-presidential candidate, with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnytska.
Mueller had previously promised to check the details of the meeting, which took place in June 2016.
They've been investigated by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. had previously said that he expected a compromise on the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's staff from the meeting with Veselnica, but no revealing documents were submitted, and the conversation was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that the younger Trump's statement about meeting with Veselnytska was literally dictated by the older Trump.
The White House clarified that the president was not dictating anything, but simply using his authority, as any father would.
Vice Mayor Penza was arrested at work .
Deputy head of the administration of the Penza Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on the instructions of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement authorities on this matter have not yet been received, but the press service of the SC said they will soon follow.
Penza's city hall hasn't commented on the incident yet.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of the administration of Penza.
She has been overseeing urban affairs and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Before that, she worked for a long time as head of the Department of State Housing Construction Inspection for the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina has three children under the age of 18, and she gave up her maternity leave a year ago and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico has no space shuttle or missile launchers.
But there's a space agency that was founded in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first man in space.
Unlike the Soviet-era monuments that are being demolished in some countries, Gagarin's monuments, on the contrary, "walk the planet".
In 2012, a monument was erected in Houston, USA, near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the grounds of the Royal Observatory was erected to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There's a Gagarine monument in Germany in the town of Erfoot, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) was saved from demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarin appeared in Riga.
That's the Latvian name and surname of the first astronaut, and he looks like he's 70.
Morse Ford murder: activists lose Lynch's trial on stage to call for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed the crowd in Monroe, Georgia, and ran to the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked the road.
The main one, a middle-aged man in a suit with a thin strip, pulled a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The people inside were trembling in fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man yelled.
"Get him out of the car!"
The sound of a cold shout broke the silence as a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that took place on July 22 was just a set.
But when Roger was thrown a loop around his neck, almost everyone in the audience actually took their breath away.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose the night the Puppets lynched two black couples in 1946, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years no one has been arrested - even though we see them around us; even though we know who they are", says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls".
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman who has fought for human rights his entire life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want an investigation, we want a conclusion, we want a cure, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice", he says.
"We cannot move to healing and reconciliation until justice is done".
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the Morse Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of being involved in the lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, human rights defenders say they have always been well aware of the two linked motives of lynchings in the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens to vote for the first time in the primaries that summer.
About the same time, the FBI reports that a black usher, Roger Malcolm, stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that rumours spread around the city that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the child she was due to have was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Louis Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of prison and into the Morse Ford Bridge, a crowd of lynchmen surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and commanded the murders", says one of the FBI reports.
"It's also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement who not only participated in the murders, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identities of the witnesses".
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on voting rights", he says.
"They were all killed to send a signal to the black people in the city that if you register and vote, you will be the same".
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has directed an annual performance that recreates the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her play is eye-catching, it captivates the audience and it tells the story of the deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer present in America.
It's hard to look at and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness", she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through".
This year's rehearsal began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - gathered in the room to listen to the play's years-long review.
Wade Marbo was the director with Green.
He's been the chief of the clan for years, but he says the role has never been easier.
"I feel like I'm screwed up because I'm not the person I am", Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember that story because we don't want to go back to that time".
Inside, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are reprising their roles.
The show begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Raconka is yelling in response.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all the black actors) is upset.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What is it?" Asks Askona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I winning?
"No", says Green with a laugh.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'nigga' back then".
"Yeah, yeah", laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to put the hard 'p' in it".
And so the energy in the room changes: discomfort is replaced by a sense of companionship.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the play, but for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rasconka says the word for the letter "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mournful black dress stands over the bodies of actors and sings Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred spectators are wiped out with tears and sweat.
There's almost the same number of black and white people in the audience.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show; many live nearby.
They all endured Georgia's harsh wind for almost eight hours while Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until that point, the murders were history, but now that they're standing in the same place where they lynched people, it seems like their ghosts are hanging in the air.
When the last note of the song is silenced, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children bend over their heads, touch the paint that shows blood and still bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead", murmurs one little boy, as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and then it's over.
Actors drop the rope off their necks and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main puppet sklan.
Nick Rasconka hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the play finally falls on him.
"It's all right", one of the women whispered.
"We know your heart is good.
You had a reason for it".
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta is excitedly discussing a performance with a black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinsky has a hard time finding words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It was hard to listen to those horrible, horrible words and actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you", she says.
"After that, I think lynchings are still happening", she adds, "but now it's called shooting by the police".
The other corner of the room was dominated by Tyrone Brooks, who recalls his work as a human rights defender at dinner.
He says he's already started planning his next year's performance.
"The play is inspiring because it not only describes the horror of what we have been through but also teaches us", he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it".
Navalny was fined for violating the "agitation Saturday"
Moscow's Simonovsky court fined Alexei Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of organizing the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offence under Article 20.2 of Article 8 of the Russian Federation's CoAP "Repeated violation of the order of organizing a rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court in Moscow, Hyzyr Mussakayev, had finished examining the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Wolkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In such a sum, Judge Mussakayev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday", which supporters of Navalny held in Moscow on July 8-9.
After seeing the agitatories, the police believed that the organizers deliberately hid the true nature of the event - a public action (for which it is necessary to ask the capital authorities for permission).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev petitioned to stop the administrative proceedings due to the lack of a constitution of the offence and pointed out that the police had made certain mistakes in the drafting of the protocol.
At the "agitation Saturday" Volkov was not detained, but he received an invitation to the police station to tell about the event he was actively involved in.
Navalny and another opposition colleague, Nikolai Lyaskin, received the same invitations.
Murdered in Mordovia, shot and killed bride and three wedding guests
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local who shot four people at a wedding, including his bride.
This was reported in the Republican Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, a 42-year-old Saransk resident shot several times at guests who had come to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under the first paragraph of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Huligancy"), the third paragraph of Article 30 and the second paragraphs of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempted murder of two or more persons committed by a commonly dangerous method, out of hooliganism").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because wedding guests decided to swim and passed through his property to the pool.
Energy Ministry toughened requirements for turbines for power plants
The Russian Ministry of Energy will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, gas turbines, and oil refineries are launched, equipment suppliers will share their access data with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government resolution is already ready and has been put to public debate.
The new requirements will only apply to "critically important energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
The document calls for potential threats such as obtaining information and access to the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unfaithful partners and hackers.
The EU has expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The press service of the European Union said on August 4 that anti-Russian sanctions were extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of "Siemens" turbines to Crimea.
This was reported earlier in the weekly Arguments.
The press service of the EU Council said that sanctions against Russia were extended due to the scandal with the Siemens turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier, it was reported that the final decision would be made by the end of the day, and now the decision has been made, sanctions against Russia have been extended.
Pearson's cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting dividends to bring the business back to life.
On Friday, British education group Pearson announced it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its initial dividend by 72 percent as it embarked on another restructuring program to address the challenges facing its businesses.
These job cuts, which CEO John Fallon says will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in publishing house Penguin Random House to its partner, Berthelsman, said its forecast for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 percent increase in primary product sales in the first half to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed by suicide bomber
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were wounded, according to a NATO report.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians also died as a result of the incident in the Karabakh city district.
This blast is the latest in a series of bloodshed attacks this month in Afghanistan: more than 30 people were killed in a bombing at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which occurred on Thursday evening, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a man-made explosive device.
According to the report, all of the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them were in the capital.
In late July, a suicide bomber's car bombing killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shi'a district.
The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack.
May 31st, a massive explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people  This is the most serious human casualty attack in the country since the United States-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence is highlighting the uncertainty in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is evaluating whether to increase the number of US military forces providing assistance to the country's troops and police.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its line of conduct, and especially in President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
Environmental Protection Agency after court suits repeals decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to postpone the Obama-era law that states must limit air pollution emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "Ozone 2015" measures, saying the move shows the agency's willingness to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and in responsiveness to them", Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to postpone ozone measurements, which measure existing air pollution in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air cleanliness standards, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the federal district of Columbia, filed a lawsuit claiming that the intent was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protection laws enacted by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader program that Trump says is geared toward brilliant economic growth.
But the move has sparked resistance from Democrats and environmental groups, who are concerned about the potential impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website says that using ozone-containing air to breathe can worsen lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
European Business Association opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed disagreement with US economic sanctions against Russia.
According to the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement says that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so free trade cannot be restricted.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow business to be separated from politics and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask police to restrict movement on the Pskov waterfront
Pskov's people's elected officials addressed the head of the UMVD for the city, Sergei Surin, about the problem of movement along the Great River.
Deputy mayor Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Stortenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
They believe that driver control will help make the area more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the pedestrian signs and ride freely along the waterfront.
It turns out that the major repairs and improvements were done in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
As noted by the Pskov news agency, in the evenings the central coast is patrolled by the PPS motor patrol and the company.
They reduce the number of cars passing, but the traffic does not stop completely.
Putin demanded that the investigation authorities not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed that the investigation authorities not take away servers and hard drives from working computers in enterprises.
The head of state said this at a meeting on the investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the use of measures in the interest of investigation that lead to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers".
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to remove copies, verify them and use them during the investigation".
The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the activity of the enterprise until it is impossible to pay taxes".
Olga Buzova said how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV host Olga Buzova admitted that she wanted to call her ex-husband - footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
The celebrity is currently in the United States, where she's working on business issues.
Just the day before, Olga was in Las Vegas, and then decided to post on Instagram.
She said she never married, didn't get new tattoos, and didn't call her ex-husband "the one who ruined my life", even though she really wanted to.
Buzova said she'll remember this trip forever because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the magic minister Cornelius Faj in the Harry Potter film series, has died at the age of 92.
This was reported by the newspaper "Independent" on Thursday.
The actor's relatives told him about his death.
They said he had "a huge life, having achieved success in film, theater and television during his 70-year career".
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, he played alongside Laurence Olivier in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre's "Tragedy about the Corylon".
Hardy is also remembered for his many performances as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including one of Agatha Christie's screen adaptations of Miss Marple.
For his role as Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981) he was awarded the British Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award.
Robert Hardy also played the role of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on several occasions.
Something was rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his Venetian wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not preparation for the festivities, but a funerary dispute.
His Highness refused the title of Prince Consort, while he appealed to the Queen that she never gave him the title of King Consort.
Henry lives in France, although he remains the official husband of the Queen.
Russian Foreign Ministry called on Washington to stop sheltering Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to Mike Pence's comments, accusing Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was made by the Foreign Ministry some time ago.
In his comments, the State Department pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop sheltering the Russian Federation.
As the week's arguments reported, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and staging a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there's talk about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving toward the most exciting boxing match in the near future at 147 pounds, first met on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of ESPN in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization lightweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over four-weight world champion Erien Broner on Saturday's Showtime channel, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of their weight.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck with that.
Lomachenko defends his belt in a match against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at seven o'clock on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for a photo, Lomachenko's manager, Agis Klimas, noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be at the very least.
"I used to be half-lightweight", Garcia recalled.
I'm up for the Bronner, but I'm not that big.
I'm not good for 140.
I want to go down to the half-light.
And he needs to get up to a half-light, and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's get them to do this.
Lomachenko has agreed.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast via the PPV service as part of his strategy to have Lomachenko make his 135th weight debut later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the lightweight world champion title at the Forum Arena on September 23.
"The fight could be on PPV because all the fans asked for it", Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that offers the best financial conditions.
We're the main names.
No other name would arouse such interest.
As soon as they're ready...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a great boxer and maybe he'll come to his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko didn't start complimenting Garcia right away and said that he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout.
Garcia said he was focused on showing off the power of the punch, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension rising before their own fight.
This fight has to happen.
No other fight has generated so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight.

Putin has instructed the Prosecutor General to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Russian General Prosecutor's Office to inspect the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General to check the Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities", Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on environmental development issues in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked for measures if the facts of violations were discovered.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new medical age assessment method, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as persons over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting tests earlier this year.
They were developed to make the age assessment of asylum applications more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized it for failing to determine the true age of some of the refugees who claimed to be minors.
Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing so far, and the forensic medicine agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the test subjects were rated as 18 or older, and in 25 other cases, the forensic medicine agency estimated that the test subject was likely 18 or older.
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that a person is likely to be less than 18.
Tests are only carried out when the age of the person is questionable.
According to Johan Goranson of the forensic medicine agency, the results are consistent with the results of the past few months.
We don't see much difference from the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are quite similar", he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases where people were assessed as being over the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, the age of the test subject was most likely 18 years or older.
However, after examining 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases a person openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves taking wisdom teeth X-rays and CT scans of the knee joints and giving them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has also attracted criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is the Carolinas endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work is to evaluate the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they have undergone sexual maturation earlier or later than usual.
I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods we use now.
Biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't identify it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told the Metro.
However, Goransen of the forensic medicine agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of mistakenly assuming a child as an adult is small.
The greatest risk we face is when a person is about 18 years old, in which case they're about 10 percent.
I'll think about running for president.
During his working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to consider whether to run for president of Russia in the 2018 elections, reports "Interfax".
This statement was a response to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremuška in Buryat region.
During a video conference on the firefighting in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election is held, we ask you all to run for this post again".
"Well, I'll think about it, thank you", the president replied.
On July 28, Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements made by some media that Vladimir Putin's pre-election headquarters would be headed by Russian President Anton Waino.
Peskov called these assumptions "nothing but baseless, hypothetical reasoning".
"As long as there are no headquarters, the establishment of headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away", Peskov said.
"It's not on the agenda yet", Peskov said.
West Virginia governor says he's switching parties.
West Virginia governor and Democratic Party spokesman Jim Justice announced Thursday at a rally attended by President Trump that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me", said Governor Justice.
I say to you today with many prayers and many reflections... today I say to you, people of West Virginia, I can no longer be of any use to you as a Democratic governor.
The rally was applauded.
"So tomorrow I'm changing my registration to Republican", Justice added.
As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play differently.
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with a 42 percent margin, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the state's only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying that Governor Justice's move to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere than work to make our country great again.
"Given only 15 governors and the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's statement is just another rejection from a party that has no leaders from above and cannot find a positive, unifying message", Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ron McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
A cat named Mr. Beautiful found a home on social media.
A pet shop in Pittsburgh, North Carolina, has built a cat named Mr. Beautiful that weighs over 14 pounds after it became famous through the Internet.
This is Mashable.
In late June, a pet owner's Facebook account posted a photo of a cat asking to find its owner because "it was obviously fed by someone before".
In comments, users noted that the animal's facial expression could become a new meme.
The publication has garnered over 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to take Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN, an American woman said she had had a similar experience: She took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users noticed an Australian cat with unusually long paws.
The animal photo post has garnered over 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could well make a career in the modeling business.
Cow praised Russia's sincere apology over the doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this was not the right time to allow the country to participate in sporting events again.
Russian representative of the Russian Federation of Athletics Dmitry Shляхtin told the International Association of Athletics Federations' congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country's exclusion from sports was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to all the athletes who had been stolen gold and silver medals.
Despite his comments, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) congress voted to keep the ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of state-funded doping.
"I thought today's response, today's report, was very sincere", Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
The whole council and the whole congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it was going through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.
Coe said he also liked that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it's been a very constructive day and we're moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that this is not the time to restore Russia to its rights", said Coe.
In the next few months, we must do everything we can to fix this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the dirty system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London, under a neutral flag.
The head of the International Association of Athletics Federations' special commission, Rune Andersen, said Monday that a number of requirements remain to be met to restore Russia.
He told reporters in London after a report by the International Association of Athletics Federations that drug testing was still not done in sufficient numbers and that the dismissed coaches were still doing their job calmly.
Court arrested Ukrainian journalist suspected of state-sponsored assassination
The journalist Vasily Muravitsky, who was detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), has been sent to prison for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the "Journal of Gytomira" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and of violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Russia does not support the Ukrainian authorities' actions against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to launch a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The commando borsini patrol ship entered the territorial waters of libya to stop the flow of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Libyan government, which, however, does not control much of the country's territory.
The Libyan parliament, which opposes the cabinet and is based in Tobruk, accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave his subordinates orders to counter the Italian ships.
Rome, however, has said it does not believe in these threats and intends to send another warship to Libya's territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of Libya's European-recognised cabinet, Faiz Sarraj.
Italian authorities set up a maritime mission to fight illegal migration after the statistics on the number of illegal migrants arriving from Libya in July were released: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.

Two leaders of the Ukrainian national team in athletics were suspended from the World Championships
Olga Zemlyack and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short distance running, were eliminated from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 world championship in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the executive board of the organization in connection with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) initiating disciplinary proceedings against the athletes.
The Ukrainian delegation also excluded the coach of the team, Sergei Basenko.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects the athlete of doping.
She is the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, the 2010 European champion in the 4-100-meter relay, and the 2012 European champion in the 4-400-meter relay.
The World Championships in Athletics will be held in London from August 4 to 13.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs do not prevent the world record-setting Neymar from transferring from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may be, it's up to Paris Saint-Germain to be held by UEFA, the governing body that controls European football, and whose authority is to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League.
From the rules of the financial fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that the PSJ will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will get a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
The PSJ can certainly lavish itself to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the powerful ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money on players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that incur huge debts in their quest for success were in fact cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on clubs' debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich initially used in Chelsea in 2003 to buy a club with good potential, and then spend heavily to improve the team and create a global brand, became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year assessment period, which spans 2018, clubs could suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini being disgraced by his removal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
Of course, FFP is alive, and we're moving forward, we're going to tighten the rules, Andrea Traversó, who controls FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the PPSJ will pay Neymar's contract at the same time, he can distribute the sum for the duration of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer fee can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on the PPSJ, as well as the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSJ was fined 60 million euros (at that rate it is 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit its squad in the Liga dei Campioni during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that may try to trick its financial inspections by inflating their income at the expense of companies associated with the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company could sponsor the PPSJ, if the amount of funding were to exceed the standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's salary in PSJ could have come in the form of payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But the PJSC and Qatar 2022 deny Neymar will be the ambassador for the World Cup, and a similar maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the PJSC mean that UEFA will be more vigilant about any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As people familiar with the situation reported on Thursday, UEFA has not held any preliminary discussions with the PSJ about Neymar's transfer.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the situation.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, ПСЖ received more than 10 million euros in profit with a turnover of 542,4 million euros.
The last financial year's report has not yet been published.
The PJS expects Neymar's arrival to be a good base for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and team logo shirts.
The club expects to increase turnover by at least 30 percent due to hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best footballers was leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that PSJ would violate the financial fair play.
"This is an obvious case of financial doping, with the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, noting that Qatar is the ultimate owner of the PPSJ.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports mogul, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's state funding.
"It's all the consequences of participation, and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
When the club belongs to the country, anything is possible.
It's getting very difficult to keep up with financial fair play because a country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the order and place of the oath .
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been developed by the State Duma's Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies were planning to put the oath of office into law.
Children under 18 years of age and those with disabilities will be exempted from taking the oath of office, according to the revised text of the amendments to the draft law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available to Izvestia), which the committee will consider before its second reading on July 11.
The idea of taking the oath of office when becoming a Russian citizen instead of signing documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies formulated this idea as an amendment to the second reading of a bill that would repeal the decision to grant citizenship to those convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the internet (Article 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as the theft of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is connected with terrorism (Article 4 of Article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, the logic was this: when you file your citizenship documents, you sign a promise to abide by Russian law - you're on the path of extremism, and you're breaking that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Justice Russia") and the Speaker of the State Duma, Вячеслав Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in first reading.
Last week, the Department of State's Committee on Civil Engineering and Legislation approved the text of the bill for second reading, but now it has been revised once again.
Now it says the order of taking the oath will be established by the president of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, the parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn setting in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, the text of the bill did not explain where such an event should take place - the list of places where the Russian Federation's coat of arms may be placed, regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, the cabinets of the heads of state authorities of the subjects, municipal bodies, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive authorities, etc.
It's most likely the Zags.
Those wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will take the oath of office after the officials check their documents.
But a Russian passport is only available after taking an oath, according to the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath must be taken before the decree is signed.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn in at 18 years old, not 14.
The rule is that those who are incapable or limited in their ability to take an oath or who cannot pronounce, read or sign the oath will be exempt from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt "other persons" from this procedure,
The new draft law also stipulates a special procedure for admitting Ukrainian residents who are considered Russian speakers to Russian citizens.
They will have to officially renounce their Ukrainian citizenship, submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the statement will need to be sent to Russian officials.
The right to refuse "foreign" citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for in an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons other than personal".
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among whom the first deputy speaker of the GD, Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Kрашенинnikov and Ayrat Farrachov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a visa from Ukraine is unrealistic, it's just impossible.
Accordingly, many people are waiting for their fate to be decided on the issue of Russian citizenship, - explained the head of the Duma committee on state building and legislation Pavel Kрашенинnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have written off their "other" citizenship and submitted their previous passport to the Russian Interior Ministry, but "for reasons not related to it" they have not ceased to be considered citizens of another country.
Now foreigners are prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, being accepted for work at facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
A person with dual citizenship or residence permit from another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
The law is scheduled to enter into force on September 1, 2017, and the necessary sub-law acts must be ready by that time.
Nostalgia is getting a little bit nicer in Hot American Summer and Detective's Companion.
The current iteration of the story is nostalgic for the characters' glory days in the '80s; the grunge era in the '90s (about the time when the great masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for themselves - that is, 2001 before her stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Rudd moved on to bigger things.
As a cultural fact, it's both the height and the embodiment of our era with its constant Facebook reminders.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"The First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurdist humor (including the original story of the talking vegetable bank that H. John Benjamin voiced).
The result is a double-header of the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually disturbed children who have just reached adulthood; thus, the impossibility of returning to the stage becomes part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots and its parody is more systematic and includes riffs from the '90s stalker films like "Hands That Lift the Crib".
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller skis, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991".
Many of the storylines are the same.
Goodwill Cooper (Showalter), now a writer, has yet to get a return from Katie (Margarith Morrow).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet broken his virginity.
And there's a crazy, mean conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), now being incited by George W. Bush (a tried-and-true parody of Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of a franchise is stepping back.
It's especially fun to see a forever young Rad singing Matt Dillon's song from "Lonely", whose character, former big man Andy, now looks old.
The success of this franchise could be a random madness in the spirit of the recurring series Seven Up until it reaches what I think would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where the entire company would go to the movies for the premiere of "Hot American Summer".
"The Detective Comrade" in the Amazon is a different kind of nostalgia: Cold War memories from "The Americans", "Blurb blonde" or even "Blink" with her images of the struggle of East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, is a television film: a 1980s Romanian police drama about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - the life-threatening Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulich, and voiced by their dialogue in English by Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess match, like Americans would watch football).
The famous behind-the-scenes voice-over team - including Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes it interesting to play "Guess Who".
But the Co-Detective is so caught up in the truthfulness of a clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - that it often looks like it.
Six long episodes are long, and it's not funny very often.
If it were shorter, the "Comrade Detective" would have been better able to handle its satire in the spirit of agitproofness; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, there are two fat men sitting in the lobby eating a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist audience, this image tells us that Western culture can make anything a meal.
The fictional Romanian filmmakers are not so wrong: we do this even with our own recent history, and with theirs.
The prize fund for the Super Cup of Russia between "Spartak" and "Locomotive" will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the president of the Russian Premier League (RFL) Sergey Prydkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the Russian Federation of the People's Liberation Army (RFP), the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that there are almost no tickets left for the match at the moment.
The game of "Spartacus" - "Locomotive" will be on Friday, July 14th, at 21:30.
As TASS reports, "Spartak" is the current champion of Russia, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young people cleaned a furniture workshop for 200 thousand rubles
A 37-year-old U.F.A. with a furniture firm called the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the factory, causing serious damage to his production.
The total cost of the stolen tools was almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic mill, a sled.
The security guards began searching for the criminals and soon came out on the residents of the Blagoveshchensk region of the Republic of Belarus, friends 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the interior ministry of the republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and removed tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service.
They have already been charged with theft, and law enforcement has been able to return only a portion of the stolen tools to their rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about the relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work together.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of the state department Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that, having adopted new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had ended its hopes for improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war on Russia.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that "area for interaction" should be sought.
"Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been in place for almost a month".
"This is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia", the diplomat quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign ministry declined to comment on the Russian prime minister's statement that sanctions are equivalent to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
He acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and violated the U.S. Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses from amethyst and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has added to the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
They have five new rings and three chocker collars on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line has two new rings and a curl made of amethyst, pink quartz and diamonds, made in a technique of gliptics (hand carving on stone) and paver and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
Dior Joaillerie's head, Victor de Castellan, was inspired by roses grown on his Granville estate by designer Christian Dior, and the Parisian gardens of Bogatel and Pre-Catalán.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump has been sharply critical of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine", the president tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House later circulated a statement from the president, in which he indicated that the law would prevent the United States from making profitable deals and bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Entrepreneur from Belarus Victor Prokopenia withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention of "concentrating on other planned investments and projects we are working on".
Mr. Prokopeni said that this would be a "best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of buying a Sberbank daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of a Russian bank's Ukrainian branch after the NBU rejected the application of NorvikBank's consortium in July by Grigory Guselikov and the Belarusian company Said Guteriev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial organizations - besides VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak named the reason for the blackout in Crimea
The Russian Ministry of Energy has named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, gave explanations about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a road traffic accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck hit the electricity transmission line, resulting in the disconnection of the Kuban and related Crimean networks.
The power outages in the major cities of Crimea were recorded last week.
The specialists fixed the problem in a matter of hours.
Initially, it was reported that the blackout could have been caused by an abnormal heat.
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weak inflation have caused rumors of a possible increase to subside.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow and left interest rates unchanged amid rising pressure on household incomes.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer committee members this month voting to raise rates because weak economic growth has weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to a rise of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that interest rate hikes over the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said that borrowing costs would likely have to rise more strongly than expected in financial markets.
The committee also voted to abandon part of the huge economic development package launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close a timely financing plan, which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has said it will now have to provide another £15 billion to £115 billion under that plan.
In the minutes on the decision on rates, the bank said: According to the main forecasts of the MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future will remain slow, while the pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that to halt inflation, it would require some tightening of financial policy, somewhat more than the markets expect.
At the moment, the markets are predicting their first increase in the third quarter of next year and another  in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be gradual and limited.
The bank's forecast for this year and next is lower than the forecasts it made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank has kept its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent discouraging growth rates weakened the increased expectation of a rise; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's spokesman, growth is expected to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason for rejoicing to households hit by high inflation and very slight wage increases: the bank said the pressure would increase before it decreased.
The bank added that financial policy could not prevent a pay shortage in the next few years, but expects wages to recover significantly by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of rising demand for British goods, driven by the low pound rate, which offsets part of the lower consumer spending.
The decision came a year after the rate was cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union led to a drop in the pound.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision on rates, there was a growing buzz around the proposed rate hike, as inflation increasingly pressured the already strong households: three committee members asked for a rate hike to 0.5% in July.
Last month inflation fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent in July, although the bank said the fall was expected and will be offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate than the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "If you consider the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like the mortgage market will become even more competitive again, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good year to end.
The market seems particularly favourable for those who are nearing the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with no commission and low interest rates, is becoming more popular than ever.
State health service will prescribe a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will be able to access the revolutionary HIV prevention drug after a battle in the High Court over funding from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in those at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service to about 10,000 people during the initial three-year trial period.
She agreed to fund the trial after the appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that the National Health Service had the option to pay for the PREP despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced Thursday, was hailed as a "most important innovation" by the president of England's National Health Service, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Agency (NAT) called it a "turning point".
Before the programme is fully launched across England by April 2018, the venereology clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and more will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP)  is a course of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
PrEP is given to a person before sex, and they take enough of certain medications to prevent HIV infection.
You can take these medications daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include gay and bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are HIV positive and are not receiving successful treatment.
Dispensers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is being curbed by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the NHS has signed a contract for the drug this week after an international tender.
The study is designed to assess the potential of PREP by collecting clinical data on who the drug is targeted to, its absorbability and wide-ranging use.
This important innovation should complement and strengthen the wider and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in over three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PEP, if properly targeted at people who are in need and at risk, will make a difference to the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study, which is being conducted in England by the National Health Service, will have access to a new, open-ended tool that people can control using themselves without discussing it with their partners, which will improve many, many lives.
We welcome this news.
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now the first thing we need to do is make sure that the test is spread across the country quickly and that no one in the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we've got the experimental PREP, we're moving on to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We welcome the start of the PREP trial, which has been delayed by months of delays and government wires.
The data shows how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PREP.
Now it's important that the test is rolled out nationwide as soon as possible to protect those at risk for HIV and to take us one step further to stop the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on supporting the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of preserving the office of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people".
In addition, the congress stressed the importance of the agreement on the demarcation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, social-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
Recall that the agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan addressed the Russian president with a request to extend the agreement and keep the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only federation entity that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president".
Difficulty in obtaining international driving licenses in Russia
The GIBD units are experiencing a shortage of international driver 's licenses (IDCs).
To get such a permit, you have to wait in line for several weeks, which is a real problem for vacationers who want to go abroad for a vacation in their car or rent it out.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licences remains controversial.
The M.B.U. was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international law are written in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in the countries that ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian law is recognized as such.
However, in reality, it all depends on the specific police or rental offices: some require the internal security, and some require enough national rights.
To be insured, drivers still get international rights, but it is worth noting that in countries that have not ratified the convention (e.g. the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or the IWU.
The problem of forms is now observed in almost all the HIBD units, reports Kommersant, conducting research in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow, UGIBD units simply do not issue a license plate, the forms have been missing for four months.
You can book an appointment on the official website, but the line is already extended until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain the MIV "for technical reasons", without going into detail, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, similar situation is occurring in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, and social media posts are increasingly appearing:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all HPD offices are out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question for people who know!"
We need international law very urgently.
In Moscow, the whole time is set far ahead, in place the stamps are not issued at all (button is available, but the stamp cannot be issued).
It seems the civil service portal shows that Spb has free time to the fist.
Has anyone tried getting it in another city?
Is it working?
As explained in the Russian Interior Ministry, the requirements for the international driver's license have changed, so the new forms are being delivered to the State Auto Inspection.
This may be due to the shortage, although it is not clear what changes are being discussed, which have not been reported before.
The Blankets are purchased by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs' Center for Special Purpose in Road Traffic Safety (CBTD) and then delivered to the GIBD.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with "Goznak" JSC: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand MBU blanks were manufactured, in 2016 15 thousand blanks were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with "First Printing Court" LLC for the manufacture of 70 thousand blanks.
There is a version that the CNS simply failed to tender in time, which caused a shortage.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people have started to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries like China, Thailand, and so on.
The rights they have there are not clear, so people are reinsured, and so there is a high demand for international shorts.
It has recently been reported that professional drivers will have to take a test to confirm their qualifications.
The Ministry of Transport made such a proposal.
The new model International Driving Permit (IDP) is valid from 31 May 2011.
Ukraine's justice minister refused to believe in the construction of the Crimea bridge
Ukraine's justice minister, Pavel Petrenko, said he did not believe Russia could build a bridge to Crimea.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the Observer.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bullet or a hook in there because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan - countries that have joined Russia in sanctions against Crimea.
"I mean, in my deep conviction, this project has virtually no prospects", Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can't build anything smaller.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums have already started to fall apart.
"So, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proved to be too short-sighted to join this project", the official noted.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the extensive assembly of the Crimean Bridge's highway arch has been completed: its vault will be closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, bridge builders have prepared a railway arch to be installed on the railway platforms", the project's information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain, a government official who hasn't been on the job for 10 years is fired
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief Spanish official, Carlos Rasio, have?
The permanent walk lasted 10 long years.
Mr. Rescio was fired, though.
But not by his immediate boss.
Which is not the case in the bureaucratic world.
The people seem to have long been accustomed to the slurs of the "servant of the people".
Yet officials always manage to surprise those whose taxes they live on.
This time, the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, Valencia archives employee Carlos Rasio managed to stay out of work for a decade.
He was paid regularly.
And the whole thing is 50 grand a year.
And then Mr. Rescio's "good times" are over.
He was dismissed by the decision of the legislature of Valencia.
The investigation revealed that the angry walker came to the office every working morning at 7:00 a.m. to check in electronically.
And he was going home.
He showed up at work again at 4:00 p.m. to signal back to the system that he was gone.
That's 10 years.
It was also reported that the traveler spent all his free time painting comics at home.
Now the members of the legislature of Valencia are thinking of how to punish the immediate boss of Mr. Rescio, who could not but know how to "actively work" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges are offering to protect from presidents
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (CHR) on the instructions of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of the government.
The JCC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their electiveness.
For the courts of appeals and cassation, the SPH wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also make its proposals under the presidential mandate.
The IPC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian judiciary.
The task was carried out by the President of the Russian Federation on 3 January 2017 on the instructions of Vladimir Putin, who gave the task after meeting with the members of the Council.
The meeting with the members of the council on 8 December 2016 discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as the problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "Ъ" of 9 December).
The work of the JCPU resulted in 25 proposals, which concern both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin's human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and has received the support of the judges' community, the chairman of the court, according to the SPI, must submit him to the appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the chairman of the right to distribute cases for consideration between judges.
Experts believe that a specially written computer program can do this.
The SPC also considers that the chairman is not entitled to "predetermine the results of the qualification of the judge, initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, decide on the establishment of additional material payments".
The President's Council also considered it necessary to "elect the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "assign them with powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all the presidents of the courts (from the republican to the district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
To protect judges from pressure from regional authorities, the SCHP proposes to reorganize appeals and cassation in courts of common jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The SPH says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts".
Experts are based on the practice of arbitration courts.
They have "court districts" that do not correspond to the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who have difficulty using the "telephone right".
The ICC proposes that the judges of the world be strengthened by the people's councils to consider with their participation certain "categories of civil and administrative cases".
For example, deprivation of parental rights, restoration at work, protection of honor and dignity, deprivation of driver's rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals", explained the SPC member, retired Constitutional Court judge Tamara Morshkova.
She also recalled that the President's order was not only for the SPH, but also for the Supreme Court (Supreme Court), which has not yet revealed its proposals.
The Air Force (among its co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Russian Human Rights Commissioner) still has time to fulfill the task.
Vladimir Putin should be informed by the Chairman of the Russian Armed Forces, Vyacheslav Lebedev, of how effectively the independence of the judiciary is being ensured in Russia.
Living a high life: a half-floor and clever design techniques have turned this little apartment into an Earl's Court apartment into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former banker who has a passion for real estate repair, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a pretty Queen Anne style typical house, and in favor of the new design, it says that Joan didn't pack her things and moved again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square", says Joan.
I was looking for something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day.
Since the first inspection, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely renovated.
It was originally a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout. To get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen. Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to maximize the benefits of the generous height of the ceilings.
I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
"That was my requirement", she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill's architectural design studio Duck & Shed to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would be suitable for Joan to live in.
The floor was not high enough to fit two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where you could stand upright.
Erfan had to think creatively to handle the brief.
Working with steel structures is very difficult, he explains.
We had to arrange the rooms so that they were on top of each other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just a simple platform that needed to be built, but a curved structure that would be at the right height and allow the space to be used from above and below.
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full-sized rooms one above the other in a secluded space and much more interesting.
From the half-floor through the copper window from Retrouvius, you can see the luxurious living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Muy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored panel looks like a window into another room.
The mirror cabinets at the entrance are used to store all of Joan's dishes.
To create a more luxurious sense of space, the beauty of the living room can enclose the kitchen when it's not in use.
There's nothing new about the folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a door that moves upwards, like a garage.
"Here was the engineering art", Erfan tells of a steel armored wooden-fibre shield door.
It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.
Using space and storage space wisely, Joan was given an additional 16 square feet, an additional bedroom, and improved planning.
"After all, the floor area is what you're going to sell, that is, what your property is valued at", says Erfan.
In short, the real estate agent will come in and make the calculations based on the floor area.
Here they were able to increase the floor area using high-quality materials that give the space a shade of luxury.
Materials  are what we touch, so they help to create an emotional connection with the home", says Erfan.
Nobody loves a wire in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch our hearts.
This is proof that with a good design and an increased meterage, an apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you may decide to stay.
The government approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy.
The relevant order is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy implementation.
The Commission will also develop projects for a cultural policy strategy, specify the objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the commission is appointed the deputy chairman of the Russian government.
The committee will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved the plan to implement the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and provides measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the common cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to eight-year low
Consumer price growth in G20 countries has fallen to the lowest level in eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% - lower values were noted in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
The agency thus recorded its first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to the ministry, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal cutting of the baykal tiger
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on environmental development of the natural Baikal territory warned against illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskaya noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It allows for the deforestation of firefighting, and the government plans to adopt it in the fall.
In turn, the president said that the project should be monitored to ensure that the cutting process "does not cut everything in a row".
Donsky noted that this bill implies control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and the supervisory agencies.
Media: Fighters of the Armed Forces secretly negotiate with the Donbass militiamen
Regular telephone communication is established in the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
The fighters of the opposing sides are constantly communicating with each other on their mobile phones, and they don't know about this communication at headquarters.
The fighters of the Armed Forces and the militias of Donbass have been communicating on cell phones in secret from their high command.
On August 4, "Straana.ua" reports with reference to participants in the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their counterparts on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not a matter of life and death: commanders are trying to reach some sort of "tactical agreement".
Often, the result of such talks is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists have learned of cases where an officer received birthday congratulations from his formal enemy outside the front lines.
The fighters of the Russian Armed Forces and the militias of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in the trenches on the border line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a military operation against Donbass.
Foreign Ministry outraged blocking the UN Security Council's statements about attacks on the Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block UN Security Council statements in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that on August 2, the territory of the Russian embassy in Damascus was shelled by the "Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham" (formerly "Jabhat al-Nusra", banned in the Russian Federation) and "Faylak Ar-Rahman" terrorists for the third time in a month.
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in qualifying Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for opposition to this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the attacks of Nusra should be met with universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the evaluation of the outbursts against diplomatic missions".
However, as the diplomatic service stressed, "for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately varying the tone of objections, disguising themselves as arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft of the Security Council statement for the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital".
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain in the conscience of these delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the Security Council's inability to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to further provocations and attacks, makes them feel impunity", the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "these barbarians would not want to have the impression that someone in the Security Council is with them".
Vladimir Putin spoke for limiting the number of off-plan checks of business
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of out-of-plan inspections by entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said that the inspections should be limited to ten days.
"Extra-plan checks are usually carried out without the proper agreement with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% are agreed with the prosecutor's office, the rest goes on its own", the president quotes TASS as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from confiscating servers and hard drives in enterprises.
In addition, the president believes that business associations should be given the right to defend their members' interests in court.
"I hope that this will contribute to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or violations of the law in the field of entrepreneurship", the head of state said.
As reported by the Commerce Department, the number of other types of inspections by entrepreneurs is increasing due to the moratorium on carrying out planned inspections.
In May, a survey was conducted by the order of the business ombudsman under Russian President Boris Titof, which revealed that the planned checks were actually replaced by non-planned ones (the share of those faced with them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial ones (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on citizens' applications (increase from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).

Brothers fighting for a real estate empire worth over $ 500 million
Two brothers fight for one of the largest empires in Victoria in the real estate trade worth over $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin de Lutyce lives in Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court over the division of property and assets.
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a heated dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family founded Westco Jeans, which grew to a network of 160 stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutyce family's estate list includes office buildings, developments in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller, and suburban shopping centers.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant figure" of the De Luthis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means Colin's estate is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
Dividing property and money was a stumbling block for Paul.
"The division offered by Colin gives him the best parts of the property in my opinion", he wrote in his first depositions in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business, which Paul says Colin has excluded him from.
Colin claims that this is not true, but accuses Paul of mismanaging some of the facilities.
In testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes the dispute will be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider seven as a top priority", he wrote.
The court costs are rising like snowballs: hundreds of pages of testimonies, emails and reports from companies like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including the King's Counsel Alan Myers, and the best of the best.
Mrs. De Lutyce and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s onwards they ran dairy bars and restaurants, and in the early 1970s bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in his senior year of high school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)".
Anna de Lutz says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons without conflict.
"Louie often told me that she did not want the brothers to go to court", she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the DeLuthis group of companies; Colin says Mark earned $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.
Paul said that Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their department".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL club's board of directors and, according to a 2015 biography published by Eddie McGee, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media reached out to Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin replied only, texting that since the case was not yet before the court, "I really have nothing to say".
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to sue our family", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not want to see Paul and I argue in court", he said, adding that "everyone is still hoping for a resolution of the conflict".
By Friday, that hope had apparently vanished.
"The court will soon rule on our case", Colin wrote.
The new head of Trump's administration plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in the hope of keeping the chief more calm.
That's what reporter Josh Dousey is reporting.
"At a meeting held by the new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly with the White House administration on his first day of office, he outlined the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the president".
Kelly told the staff that information should be passed through him -- in paper form or through briefings -- because the president would be better at making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is absolutely correct, but others have already failed to appease Trump by tracking information to him.
President Trump's relationship with television began decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his TV habit is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, got angry about the campaign's unfair coverage, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in the publications that could be persuaded", Sam Nanberg, a former election counsel, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmer wrote in Politico that "six former election staff members said that to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, he needed to keep the personal information he received in a constant stream of praise".
I'm going to be fine.
But the idea that Trump's habit of tweeting was ever "controlled" is just ridiculous.
Maybe these election officials know something we don't, like if it wasn't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump hasn't posted.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to stop Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to push their agenda by giving Trump material - reliable or not - that supports their views.
Politico, just like this story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly leak questionable information to the president.
Here's an example, as reported by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former staff say that Trump can react very sharply to negative news stories in the press, especially those that contain dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
That's what happened in late February when someone handed the president a printed article from GotNews.com, an Internet provocateur site for Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Welsh was accused of "standing behind a series of leaks" at the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently banned from Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn't provide specific facts, or that he's made false accusations in the past and then denied them.
Trump read the article and agreed to interview the staff about Welsh".
Goldmacher adds that then-Chairman of the Office of Reins Prebus and Clerk of the Office Rob Porter "attempted to build a system to manage the flow of paper that Trump receives and document it".
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has a very impulsive nature, and his aides still fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's job very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor 's office is fighting HIV dissidents
The prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Kaliningrad district court in Tyumeni, which had closed the criminal case against a local woman whose young daughter died of HIV.
The investigation claims the child died because the mother was an HIV-positive and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from her responsibility in connection with reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes that a crime cannot go unpunished without setting a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the Tyumenian woman was brought under Article 109 (1) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (cause of death due to negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of stage 4 HIV infection.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there is no HIV infection", the Tyumen prosecutor's office explained.
The criminal case was brought before the Kaliningrad district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to dismiss it.
The father of the deceased girl filed a petition, explaining that he "forgave his wife, has no complaints against her, she has forgiven the harm and apologized".
The prosecutor's office disagreed with the court's decision and appealed, demanding that the order to stay the case be reversed and remanded.
The girl is dead, and the damage caused by the crime cannot be repaired.
The HIV-infected mother, despite the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection", the prosecutor's office said.
The supervisory authority says she should be punished, or other HIV-positive people will follow suit.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, about 12 children living with HIV in the region are not receiving medical care because their parents refuse to provide them.
"And this situation has improved - during the year of the special group's work, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat their children for HIV changed their minds - they allowed for diagnosis, started taking drugs", said Elena Loseva, spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
She said that it is impossible to influence parents by law and that not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, and run away with their children from hospitals.
What is the danger of HIV-positive people ?
Last year, the St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called HIV dissidents' movement in Russia.
HIV-dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and AIDS NGO activists call such views anti-medical, and they see their spread as a serious threat.
The gruesome photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Greek Railway Station in Kmelnitsk.
A cheerful company of drunken young men were walking along the bridge over the railroad tracks, just where a freight train was standing.
One of my friends had an idea to take a selfie on the roof of a car, police communication department in the Khmelnytsky region told "FAKTAM".
The boy started to get off the bridge and onto the train, but due to his carelessness, he got caught behind the power line and was instantly struck by lightning.
Fortunately, the station manager was notified of the incident, which promptly called for an emergency.
Before the doctors arrived, the victim was transferred to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn ward of the Khmelnytsk regional clinical hospital.
The men had 1 to 2 degrees of burns to the body.
His condition is now assessed as stable.
Law enforcement officials say that recent times have seen extreme selfies on rooftops, bridges, and on moving vehicles become increasingly popular.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and avoid such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have admitted the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
Ancient Venus may have had oceans.
French scientists have made this assumption.
Scientists have developed a computer model that demonstrates the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, reports Science News.
It turns out that early in its history, Venus had oceans that contained 10% more water than the Earth now.
Earlier, Arguments of the Week wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts concluded that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a shooting in a park in San Francisco.
Three people were injured in a shooting in San Francisco, the Associated Press reports.
The incident happened in Dolores Park when there were a significant number of visitors.
Witnesses say several men on the bridge started yelling threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting at people.
The attackers' appearance was not to be considered, as they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was treated and then released.
The third victim is a minor, no details of his condition.
Dolores Park is a popular hilltop destination for locals and tourists alike.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured trying to leave the building.
Louna will be releasing a new album in Barnaul.
The Louna rock band will perform in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will be presenting their new album "The Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The group is preparing a concept show that will be the most brilliant in the band's concert history.
"Divine New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
It is named after the famous O. Huxley anti- utopian novel "O Wonderful New World".
The new songs do not recount the book, but tell of a society that lives by the law of antutopia, "blinded by propaganda and imposed values".
The group was helped by the audience to raise money for the album: on the website "Planeta.ru" more than 1200 people supported the project.
Louna released her first album, "Do It Loudly!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians released the album "Time X", and in 2013 recorded the album "We - it's Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna performed with a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the "Songs About the World" program.
The group consists of Lucine Gevorkyan (vocal), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratiyev (guitar), and Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will take place at the Barnau club "Faraon" on October 17 at 19.00.
Tickets are priced from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most sought-after bands on the Russian rock scene.
The collective was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was in 2009.
The group has won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "Damn Dujin".
The gypsies have overcome the pits and returned to the street of millionaires.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again in conflict with the determined gypsies who have overcome the pits dug by the local authorities to take back the field near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihull Street, which was given the humorous name of Millionaire Street.
They brought horses, babies and a host of wheelchairs, but returned after being driven out no later than in May, and they were not hindered by a hole dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defensive structures and pushed their vehicles through a site that was left unfenced to leave room for a trail.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying it was unable to solve the problem.
An anonymous local resident said: "They came here on Monday night after being chased out of Bentley Heath where they were throwing stones at passersby".
The municipality should be embarrassed and forced to act because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were driven out, and now they're back.
There were more gypsies coming in last night, and maybe more today.
'Birmingham City Council knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,' she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying municipal taxes, and the municipality can't even stop it.
One local resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said, "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leave last time, and here's the attack, please".
This time, they were more and we even saw a horse grazing on the lawn.
A Solihull Municipality spokesman said: "We know of an illegal camp on the land off Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to evict them as soon as possible".
To help us collect our evidence, it's important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police on the 101 call.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case.
Crimea is activating the "New World" champagne winery
The DUP of the Republic of Crimea "New World Champagne Wines Plant" decided to act, transforming it into the OAO "New World Champagne Wines Plant", follows the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anuykina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the state ownership of Crimea.
The share capital of the joint stock company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares of a nominal value of 100 rubles each .
The Crimean Ministry of Agriculture stated that if within the next three years no funds are found to modernize the plant, the plant will be threatened with closure.
The wear and tear of the main assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The company needs 1,2 billion rubles to modernize. Due to the specificities of its organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is problematic, talking about attracting loan funds of large credit organizations is difficult", - said Deputy Head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea Sergei Petelin in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the forecast plan for privatization for 2017 .
It was proposed to be put up for auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of Crimea estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $30 million.
In 2016, New World increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to 2015 levels - to 1,52 million bottles.
In 2017, New World was planning to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Leo Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the New World estate he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Lower city third graders smashed more than 40 tombs
The employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region have identified the identities of the citizens who destroyed 46 tombs in the cemetery of the city of Liskovo.
The perpetrators were third-graders.
The first statement that the tombs were damaged by unknown persons came to the Russian MVD for the Liskovsky district on June 27.
A total of 24 people have reported to the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or contamination of burial places".
Police have identified the suspects, two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told police they were interested in seeing the statues fall, which prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Prevention measures were carried out with the children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone on NGOs rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not follow the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities", Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Stampa daily newspaper in Turin.
The warning came the day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization "Jugend Rettet" on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been operating for a year, has declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrosio Cartosio.
"We have and will continue to put human life on the top of our list, so we regret that we cannot continue our search and rescue activities now", the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the charges now, once we gather all the information and assess the situation".
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventus, owned by the Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking on migrants in whole lifeboats, which were sent directly to them by human traffickers, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the indictment, which was published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coastal authorities who control the rescue operations in this area, more out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The code of conduct presupposes, in particular, that the Juventus-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Extended Embraces.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they would not cause any "significant changes or interference" with its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning MSF.
Meanwhile, the Ministry said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support Libya's coast guard and cooperate with local mayors are paying off.
"In recent days we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any side of the conflict"
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policies in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations from the opposing Libyan sides have joined.
The head of the Russian contact group for intra-Libyan settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, the assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Daygov told "Ъ", what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and who is betting on.
There's almost no information about the contact group you're leading in Libya.
Let's say the contact group in Ukraine is known.
And here's the curtain of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was created on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by the Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya. - "Ъ").
The last one is authorized to work in Libya by State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The group was formed in response to the detention of a Russian tanker "Mehanik Chebotarev" in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military experts, representatives of the State Duma, was established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How come you're the one who led it?
Since I've been working in Libya since 2008, I've been asked to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of the seamen from the Mechanic Chebotarev.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major groups facing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Sarraj is based) and Tobruk (the residence of the parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister of Libya - "Ъ"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
And that's when it was decided to make more effective use of those contacts, to create a contact group.
Her task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all sides of the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any side of the conflict, we are engaged in dialogue with all sides.
How many people are in the contact group and how many are in Libya on a regular basis?
There are five people in the contact group now.
Among them are people with experience in the military, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to include a group of experts from the region, representatives of the Institute for the Middle East of the Russian Federation.
There are no staff in Libya at all, so there's no need for that.
Are there any Russian military advisers or instructors in Libya now?
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and the publicity about it is not true.
But your contact group includes former military personnel...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we visit hot spots.
Or cities that have been closed to us for a while, like Misurata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and have become increasingly active in the years since.
We arrived in Misurata in January of this year.
We were scared, they said that they were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why these rumors are going around, what the role of Islamists is really.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were destroying ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was captured by the militants of the banned "Islamic State" - "Ъ" in Russia).
We wanted to look at them, meet these people, see if they were the ones who played a crucial role in destroying ISIS in Libya, not the caliph Haftar who claimed that credit.
So what's your conclusion?
Is it not Haftar who defeated the Islamic State in Libya?
He didn't do that.
Haftar was operating on the other front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirte was fought by government-owned structures in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people to Russia who were conducting this counterterrorism operation.
And they came - the visit lasted from April 19 to 23, this year, and the Libyan delegation was welcomed into the Federation Council, the State Duma, the Foreign Ministry and the Rosgwardi.
You've been to every region in Libya, and you're probably imagining the mood of the local elites and field commanders.
Do you think the ceasefire agreement reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Sarag will be implemented?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, will agreements be broken, will hostilities resume, will the parties try to seize power alone?
The fact that Saradj and Haftar agreed to meet again was a good sign for us.
In the recent past, both leaders have received extremely negative reviews about each other.
As for Russia's position...
There are many reports that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe this.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and it was on this very day that Haftar was boarding the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata, they didn't believe in coincidence.
They said, "You must be very brave people to come to us today".
But our task is to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we are engaging in dialogue with all the key players in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were talking.
Does the fact that he studied in the USSR twice make it easier to understand Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
If he knows Russian, he's very relative.
But what he learned from us, of course, makes it easier to have a conversation with him.
And not just with him, by the way.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who have studied in Russia or the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they're drawn to Russia, and they're somewhat nostalgic for it.
Do you think it's possible to lift the arms embargo against Libya soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in Russian arms supplies?
They are interested, of course, but as I said, we are not taking sides in this conflict and we would not like to arm some to the detriment of others.
We'd like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to help lift it.
The process of drafting a constitution is now underway in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach a compromise, reach an internal consensus.
Then there's an election, which was discussed at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and a legitimate government is finally elected (and now none of the parties have such a status), then the UN Security Council can raise the issue of lifting the arms embargo.
Raising this question now is pointless and dangerous, it will only escalate the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, facing the problem of African refugees arriving from Libya, feels left behind by its EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its links with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the possibility that Haftar's squads will establish control of the coast and put an end to the smuggling of immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We're working hard on that.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with Haftar, Saraj, Misurata and the south of the country.
And the tribes in southern Libya are very important in this, and they are willing to cooperate with Russia.
Is this about the southerners stopping the flow of migrants on long-distance approaches?
So, you mean, conditionally, rolling back buses that carry Nigerian migrants?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help unite the southerners in the negotiation process between the Saraj, Haftar and the southern tribes.
But first, we'd like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saradj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia law in the country.
How radical is his view?
Will this not be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get that reputation?
It's created by countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there is the legislative, executive and judicial branches.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government agencies.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
We've been mixing up all the cards and we've been actively communicating with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we're already reaping the rewards of this: Rosneft has signed a cooperation agreement with Libya's state-owned oil company, NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft head Igor Sechin had a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil from Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll have to sell it.
What other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
In particular, the agreement on transport (railway construction), energy (electricity) and other matters has been reached.
And the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
So, like Iran, is this a "oil for services" scheme?
I don't know what the scheme is, but I'm not directly involved in these issues.
The economy is not really important to Russia in Libya.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
The key for us is to stop the bloodshed, help the Libyans to reconcile so that they can establish order and Libya is no longer a conducive environment for terrorism.
For Russia, that's the main task of helping the Libyan people and driving out terrorists.
Do you have any evidence of the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that no Russian or other ex-USSR nationals are there today.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya) and Russian language was not spoken there.
So what countries are these fighters from?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then let's put it another way.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, no more than 5%.
The rest are just a bunch of things.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Libyan negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are plans.
We are in active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have declared their readiness to come again - to Moscow or to Grozny.
When can we have these talks?
It's hard to say right now.
There are still a few more visits to make, and I hope that we can be clear about the time and place of the talks.
In the Czech Museum , donors raised money for a gift to a sick boy
In the Moscow-area "Melihovo" museum-reserve, a nine-year-old boy named Sasha Matsol, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a specialised running track as a gift on August 5.
The gift will be presented by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow region, Oksana Kosareva, and the museum's director, Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the trainer was raised during the charity marathon "Don't tire of doing good", which took place in Melikhov on July 15th, the day of Chekhov's memory.
On the eve of the marathon, Sasha, a resident of the village of Manushkin in the Chekhov district, wrote to the museum: "I can't see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter".
"I would love to have a treadmill as a gift so that my legs can be stronger and I can learn to walk a little bit".
And now Sasha's dream is coming true!
After the presentation, the museum-reserve will host the "Consert-postscriptum" - a famous pianist, a well-known Russian artist Alexander Gindin will perform a poppy of popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Wasteland of the Wasteland of the Wasteland of the Wasteland of the Wasteland, the callers of the workshop of Ilya Drosdyhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Chaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnezin, artists of the Melikhov Theatre "Czehovskaya studio" performed.
A book fair and a charity sale of marathon-like souvenir products were held for the visitors.
The "Melihovo" museum-reservation has made the July 15 Memorial Day of Chekhov a single day of charity in all museums of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Gitomir region, near a local football stadium shot several times at teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, the department of communication of the police of the Zhytomyr region told "FAKTAM".
The man then went to a nearby cafe.
In the building, a conflict broke out, during which a man used a device to fire rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim has been treated with the necessary medical care, and is not in danger of death.
Police and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the shooter had disappeared by then.
Law enforcement identified him and detained him the same day, August 2.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet firing device that's been sent for inspection.
The criminal proceedings were initiated under Article 296 (huliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The prisoner is facing imprisonment for three to seven years.
Recall that in Kiev, at Lukyanovka, near Tatarskaya Street, on the night of July 28, there was a shooting attack.
Michelle Carter's sentence for the messages that led to Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusetts resident was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide by texting and making phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the involuntary murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at a hearing Thursday: "My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was allowed to remain at large until appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy both suffered from mental illness.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream blouse, was listening to the verdict standing, shaking hands and lowering her eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy with her actions", the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her own.
She didn't accept responsibility", she said.
"She showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic case she deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that he felt that her "age, maturity, or even mental illness had no significant effect on her actions".
Prosecutor Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, read a statement that said: "Not a day has passed since I mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I'm doing - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will stay with us forever", it says.
Sister Roya Camden Roy said that she was constantly haunted by the thought of never being able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"Loss of someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life", she said.
This case is likely to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would require a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in his car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the entire country when it became known that he was motivated to commit suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off a roof, stab yourself, I don't know there are many ways", she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the lighter and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and forbade her to talk to the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
Lawyers have been divided on this matter.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, published her opinion in the Los Angeles Times, stating: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison".
Eugene Bogatchev: "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight"
One of the best basketball players in the WTB League, 33-year-old Keith Langford has left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender of "Izvesthi" was commented by the president of UNIX, Eugene Bogachev.
Keith made this decision because of family circumstances, - said Eugene Bogatchev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go to him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played three seasons at UNIX and in every game he showed a high level, he put in 100%.
So I let him go like a bird of high flight.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and in his playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver medal of the 2015/16 Unified League.
In the 2016/17 season he won the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This is the second time since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
Soon Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese Shenzhen, Eurohoops reports.
The American is expected to sign a two-year, $5 million contract.
Langford will be the second star of the Euroleague in July, which is moving to the Chinese championship.
Previously, the former Panathinaikos center Janis Burussis moved to the Chinese CBA.
A sunburned tourist from Moscow was evacuated by helicopter in Adyghey
Adyghe rescue workers today evacuated a tourist from the mountainous region of the republic, who was severely sunburned.
The man was staying at the "Fish" shelter, which is located at an altitude of 1,6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had elevated blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
A preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The head of the Turkish group turned to the rescue team, who said the man was burned during the campaign.
Audi has to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
A day before the announcement, Audi announced that it would offer software updates to more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes there are more intelligent roads than driving restrictions, with European cities including Munich where BMW is based considering banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler announced on Thursday that it would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing diesel-fuel-neutral equipment is also rising for automakers, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive car price.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of indulging influential automakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the mistake of the Volkswagen, which hid the use of so-called "defeat devices" that could manipulate the amount of harmful gases emitted during testing to keep it in line with the rules and turn off in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several executives of the Volkswagen have been indicted, and the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department in Germany was arrested as part of the Audi engine development group.
Former manager, Zaqueo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was the subject of a German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after authorities accused Audi of setting up the system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded the investigation, which was previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's revenue.
A cafe visitor paid in fake money in Astrakhan
Police received a message from a bank employee about the discovery of a suspicious note of 5 thousand rubles when counting the money received from the general food point.
A study conducted by the Center for Experts in Criminology found that it was a fake.
According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Astrakhan region, one of the guests who bought the chaurma paid with the banknote.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a means of identifying the authenticity of the notes.
Currently, the police are appointing persons involved in the production and sale of a deliberately counterfeit ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Interior urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when making financial transactions; trade facilities workers are advised to install instruments to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a "hell" planet where even iron can melt.
When astronomers first learned about the stratosphere properties of the giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, they were amazed at its temperature, which evaporates iron and other metals.
The scientists noticed that water molecules are so hot with the light of a star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b is a so-called "hot Jupiter" - a gas giant comparable in size and mass to the largest planet in the solar system, but tens of times closer to its parent star.
Because of this, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 Earth days a year, and its gas shell is heated to nearly 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is threatening the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and the south of France, but now there are concerns that it is threatened by climate change.
The lava has become worse due to dry weather and insect-borne diseases; this has caused a constant headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shess, an expert at the Provence-based CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute, says: "The lavender in Provence is really at risk because in recent years the plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: much less rain in spring and especially in autumn.
It affects the lifespan of the lavender.
And there are also small, leaf-leaping, microbacterial insects, which in very dry weather become very numerous".
There's a lot on the table.
Lavandal is not only a popular holiday destination; it is also a popular perfume and cosmetics product.
Eric Shas says: "Instead of very long stems with a large number of large flowers, we have small, undeveloped, weakened, or absent ones.
So we have fewer parts that contain essential oil".
Solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and extracting more drought-resistant varieties.
Winter Universiade 2019 ambassador met with schoolchildren from Krasnoyarsk
Two-time world champion in hockey, Winter Universiade 2019 ambassador Alexander Semin met with the new hockey players and handed out autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held in the Winter Universiade 2019 tent as part of the week dedicated to hockey with the hooks.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on an artificial ice rink.
In addition, relay events, quizzes and games were organized with the student games' souvenir products, and a refreshment from the Federation of Aerobics.
Fifty students attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible on sports pitches and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to play hockey.
"It's good that there's a place like the Winter Universiade 2019 shed in Krasnoyarsk where the beginner athletes can ask the coaches of the teams directly", the champion said.
It should be noted that the 2019 Winter Universiade ambassadors are helping to promote student sports and healthy lifestyle among the red-haired.
The shuttle will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Winter Universiade 2019 directorate reports.
The State Department commented on Medvedev 's words
U.S. State Department official Heather Nauert, commenting on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said that it was necessary to find "area for cooperation" with Russia.
She said such areas should be found to "improve bilateral cooperation".
An example of such successful cooperation, Naworth called the ceasefire agreement in Syria.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work together", the diplomat said.
Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev's claim that there was a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said this, it has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this subject", the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington had declared a full trade war on Moscow, ending hopes for improved bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said the US sanctions would last for decades.
In addition, the prime minister believes, the American establishment "clearly defeated" Trump.
The missing bodybuilder in Moscow was found at a house with a memory loss .
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he left the car's saloon to go to the toilet.
For seven days, he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and locals.
And I found Shamil at someone else's farm in Ramensky.
He was discovered completely naked in his bathroom by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how he got here or what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
The missing persons were identified by the missing persons report.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded a partial memory loss and a brain injury in Khanmetov, Mash reports.
There's probably more surprises for the athlete.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil may have already been in his apartment, from which he also stole the keys.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
The actual oil and gas revenues received by the end of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, reports the Russian Ministry of Finance.
The increase, the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value in June used for the assessment, as well as due to the fact that the actual volume of gas production and the volume of oil products export exceeded the forecast levels.
"The deviation of the federal budget's oil and gas revenues from the monthly assessment, corresponding to the Federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is forecast to be +40,2 billion rubles", the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated to the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47,6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Russian Ministry of Finance will involve the Bank of Russia in foreign currency purchasing operations.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will enter into foreign exchange purchase transactions on the organized markets of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the Federal Treasury's Central Bank accounts.
The murder of a journalist highlights the increasing danger in Mexico.
The staff of the weekly Riodose usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover recent violent crimes in Sinaloa state involving organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing drug trafficking war.
But today, repressed by their own tragedy, they met to discuss security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists were discussing what seemed safer: taking the children to an office where they had already thrown a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and insider information will suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a whole list of thugs who make the work of covering up the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence is not breaking down, and among the dead bodies that are multiplying in the country, there are more and more journalists: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have already died in seven states.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of "RioDOS" Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", wrote Valdes in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is felt very sharply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdés showing his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodose building; two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smile, face in glasses, or his signature panorama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss his general trauma, his nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalism cases, so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed each year in connection with drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists' killers rarely appear in court.
Riodose journalists insist they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are saddened by the tragedy, even though it is much more dangerous.
"Without information on the killers, without justice, talking about security at meetings is of little use", says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar", he says.
"Until we know the cause, we suspect everyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodose office in the state capital of Culiacán.
He managed to drive only a couple blocks before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelve River".
Shooter drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two grown children.
Rumors usually spread quickly around the Culican.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Not to mention the fact that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug kings that are larger than many living people's homes.
Forget it for a minute, the state of "quiet" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this and Valdés' knowledge of the dangers of his work, 60-year-old Ismail Bohorkes, co-founder and director of Riodos, is crushed by guilt over failing to protect a friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damasso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel that is at war with Guzman's sons.
The publication could anger the sons; people who were allegedly gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn't force Valdés to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He'd been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at "Noroeste" and in 2003 he and five colleagues founded "RioDose", selling their $50 stock.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on the subject of drugs", said Bohorkes.
Over time, the newspaper gained a reputation for being a bold and honest publication, and sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold stories without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that they could read about what no one else dared write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodosa received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for her work as a reporter in Latin America.
That same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for his bravery in investigating the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it leads.
He admitted frankly that he was afraid.
"I want to live", he said at the CPJ awards.
The Sinaloa drug trade is "a way of life", he said in an interview with Rompéviento TV last October.
"You have to take the challenges that come to you as a journalist - either that or you're just being a fool".
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff of Riodos miss Valdez, a joker who used to bark like a porter in the harbor, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to get along alive.
They relied on their own order.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guaiabo, the bar across the street from his office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, "Did love for the once-established order destroy him?"
His death also made them doubt their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you getting into their wives, their children, their legal business and their underground drug-trafficking airfields.
"These things were beyond the reach", Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to believe your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andres Villarreal, is that "the smell can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier happens".
The old rules, he says, and others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is changing all the time.
In the room where Riodose staff gathered for security training, cell phones were suddenly banned: days earlier, it was revealed that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was being used in Mexico to track journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers are hiding in the shade of a tree from 104 degrees Celsius heat.
They were tasked by the state government to guard the Riodosa office, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois Quarter of Culiacán.
Some journalists have jokingly asked if these police officers are among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials the governor himself said they couldn't be trusted.
A few months ago, the journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
The next issue of Riodos was based on three main themes.
This is the Sinaloa murder of former boxing champion Julio César Chávez' brother.
They also had a revelation of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a mass abduction at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiana, a block from the DA's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant for both drug dealers and the authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered to a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of power for almost the last century.
Several governors from the PRI have recently been charged with corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at this restaurant, including when El Chapo's son Guzman escaped military raids.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a column by Valdés with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what had happened", says 46-year-old Villarreal, known for his fat body called "El Flaco".
"Today, all communication channels with our sources are broken".
Valdes's cabinet is now used as a storage facility for posters and stickers protesting the murder of journalists because the staff have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office the next morning, dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west of the country three days after Valdés was killed.
They found the body burned, and the authorities said it was him based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak out, organize protests, and write "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls of houses.
That day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to gain international support for the demand for justice in the Valdes case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdés, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their deaths because they told the truth.
She then asked not to be given more government coverage, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Valdés has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not killed by gangs of drug dealers; they are killed by orders from politicians and security services who are in collusion with organized crime.
The Committee to Protect Journalists' Article 19 reports that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out on the orders of police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up", says Ramirez.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
She was found on her body with a note, allegedly written by the Zetas cartel, that said, "I'm here because of my articles".
The computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some publications have chosen to close, like El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after its correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on, like "El Maniaño" from Nuevo Laredo after the 2004 murder of its leader.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What Do You Want From Us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even their country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it's hard to find work, and they still find danger on the streets.
And sometimes they get killed, as it obviously happened with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after he fled Veracruz.
Those who stay and keep working balance risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he is afraid to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist", he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready to be printed, the publishers of Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk near the office drinking beer when their phones rang at the same time.
A series of gunfire between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 bodies behind, according to confirmed data.
The war continued, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
They were sitting on the sidewalk, putting the news on the Riodosa website via their mobile phone.
The next day, I had to rewrite the first page.
Sirens rang out nearby, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes has seen if the police guarding them are ready to defend.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the entire Sinaloa, the staff of Riodose continued his case.
"How can you think of closing up", said Bohorkes, "if the very day Javier was killed, a practitioner asked me to send her out to do a report?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though it's a scary one.
The researchers said that the first finds of a rhinos-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts called it the "Moon Lizard among dinosaurs".
It's so well preserved, they could even tell that his skin was reddish-brown and that he had a kind of dark past.
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as the best preserved Tyrrhenian dinosaur in the history of discovery and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.
This fossil is a recently discovered specimen of a mid-Mile Age, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible health has stunned researchers who call him "really amazing".
This herbivorous tyreophore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of discovery, according to articles in National Geographic.
It was discovered by Sean Funk while he was working at the Sancor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed different from the other rocks, and he decided to look closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrill Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was underway to find an animal in the earth's depths weighing 2,500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It's just a little bit of a nap, and you can almost believe it's sleeping", said lead author Caleb Brown, a research associate at the Royal Tyrrill Paleontological Museum, where the creation is on display.
It is one of the most beautiful and well-preserved specimens of the dinosaur.
By studying its skin, researchers found that the herbivore, although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was apparently in significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful armor-covered dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and it used a protective technique known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow it to blend more quickly with its surroundings and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, suggesting it was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature, a member of the no-dosaur family, was widely reported in the press in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrill Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum laborer Mark Mitchell, one of the group members who spent more than 7,000 hours digging it.
The remarkable preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the shape and shape of the scales and the panzer plates on his body.
They discovered a protective dye, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the protective paint is well-known, the discovery came as a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly larger than the size of the animals that are now living with protective paint.
It is possible to assume that this dinosaur was so heavily hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to disguise confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective paint, such as reindeer, zebras, or armored animals, are much smaller and more affordable prey, suggesting that the rhinoceros had to struggle to survive.
"The serious predator threat to a massive, powerful dinosaur covered in armor shows how dangerous the prey dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur's scabbard also suggests that its skin was supposed to be reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and lay back down on the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably extended farther into the land than they do now.
"This no-dosaur is truly remarkable for being completely covered in preserved scabby skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original form of the animal", Brown said.
As a result, the animal looks almost exactly the same as it did in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use your imagination to recreate it, you just need to lean a little bit, and you can almost believe it's sleeping.
The Cretaceous period is the era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of these, the tyrannosaur rex, lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, the tyrophorus could be hunted by one of its formidable ancestors.
They include the 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-tonne-weight acrocanthozoa.
Scientists whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mummified in the ice.
The creature was discovered by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it's the best-preserved thyroid in the world, along with the skin and the pancreas, and it's healthy from the forehead to the thigh.
On average, these creatures were about 18 feet long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their distinctive feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous tyreophore heavily trod what is now Canada until a river that flooded it dragged it into the open sea.
But underwater burial of the dinosaur has preserved its armor with precision to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the boggy panzer plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic, the degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin are still covered by the boggy, armored plates that line the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it bent upwards.
I can count the spoons on his bottom.
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without having any identification or citizenship.
The Polish publication Telewizja Republika reports Saakashvili's arrival, which posted a video of his speech on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at the event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against the Hitler troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not speak Polish, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak in English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the theme of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the Ukrainian Migration Service stripped him of his citizenship was learned by the politician while he was in the United States.
How he managed to make the transatlantic flight without papers is still unknown.
Earlier, former governor of Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the application for Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician emphasized that he had not filled out any questionnaires.
The investigation of the case of Weinzikher and Olkhovik has been extended to January
The preliminary investigation period of the case of the co-owner of the "Renov" group of companies Evgeny Olkhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinzikher has been extended to January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman court is considering a question on the extension of the accused's house arrest.
The representative of the S.C. at the meeting announced the decision to extend the preliminary investigation period for the last time.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigative actions on the territory of several Russian subjects", the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed Komi's management.
Their total size is estimated at at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovik, and former head of the ZJSC "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vimpelkom", handed bribes to the top officials of the Komi Republic for setting the most profitable tariffs on heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olkhovik were arrested, staged to Syктыvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from investigation and was declared a federal wanted.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City for a tourist trip, a St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented out via Airbnb, watching a Facebook video on her phone.
She ran into a post from a high school student.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and he's still lying in the middle of the street".
Noting that no one else on her tape had ever posted this information, she was puzzled, closed down Facebook and opened Twitter.
Her tape had a lot of user interviews with Nick @TheePharoah.
The Greater St. Louis rapper tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in real-time.
He posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body lying in the middle of the street, where it's gonna be for four hours.
"This is wild", thought Ferrell.
But death was not new to her and her circle.
She put the phone down, and later that evening, she went back to tweeting about people coming to Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signal tape and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a poster that said, "The Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched the live broadcast as a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, took a rifle and said, "I'm going to kill you all... animals!"
"It's a very unusual situation", Ferrell said in her own memory.
It's not the kind of murder we're used to, and we can call it typical.
That's when I felt a tingle.
I was angry and crying.
She took a return flight ticket and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided they'd both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years became the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets? that will be released on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in communities and crowding the streets, demanding answers.
As Ferrell traveled to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a floral dress and a colorful wreath, they recalled a conversation they had had countless times before that morning about the experience of black people and their plight.
She remembers saying, "Remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong.
I couldn't help but take it", Ferrell said later.
What's happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised by it.
She needs to be able to understand not only activism and organization, but also the different levels of experience of black people and their situation and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I can provide her with an environment where she herself would not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd be doing her a disservice to keep her from doing this.
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop on South Florissant Road, a site across the road from the police station that became a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's final acquittal.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined a local businessman who prepared lunch packages.
They collected the packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little Ferrell's mind was taking on a new form of activism.
"My activism has changed completely since August 9", she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the National Minority Health Students Association and worked for food justice and health inequality among black communities.
I didn't have any experience as an organizer.
It came on its own.
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folian, one of her co-directors.
Folian said she and her chief operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferrare simply wanted to document the events.
Ferrell asked, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play?"
This skepticism was fueled by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and perseverance.
As Folian explained in a recent interview, "We've heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don't get the attention, and they want to do it differently".
By then, Folian had teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His involvement sparked a sympathy for the project among Ferrell and six other locals, with whom the Whose Streets Project team has been in touch for years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, it's not us or us that we speak to, it's us", Davis said.
It was most important to me how these people were going to be represented, because that's how I was going to be represented.
And while the project's goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience in trying to show that the movement was not about a leader-saviour, but about how the community unites, as Foleyann said, it turned out to be the most open of the participants.
The result is that Whose Streets unexpectedly reveals personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married her husband.
"I felt naked", said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw a finished product.
But I realized that when you do this kind of work and humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.
In addition, Ferrell's story again discusses and highlights the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- those who created the social media tag #BlackLivesMatter after the murder of black teenager Trevon Martin in 2012 -- call themselves gay.
"Black gay women in leadership positions support this movement", says Ferrell. "It's because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women have to carry all this burden.
Folian agreed with this assertion, noting that the movement was actually supported by black women and many gay black women.
However, she insists that this is not a case of positive discrimination and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of her distinctive features.
She was the person who woke up that energy, she said.
On the other hand, it's no coincidence that she was on the front page because when
You can feel the energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long been without a camera, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on probation for two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the social and political atmosphere of the place it calls home, simply:
She's still holding on to the vocabulary she learned when she took out on the crowded streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We must win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
Two El Salvadorans Disqualified for Biting US Players
The players of the Salvadoran national team, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, were disqualified for long periods for their unsportsmanlike conduct.
During the quarterfinal match of the Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONKAKAF) Gold Cup, the Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was Henry Romero, the defender.
The El Salvador man bit the attacker, Josie Altidor, and then stabbed him in the chest.
Then midfielder Seren, when he hit a corner in his penalty area, bit US defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games, and Serena for six.
The meeting ended with a 2-0 victory for the Americans, Goal.com reports.
The appearance of similarity: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at the Friedman Gallery in New York City, there are people's faces hanging from the ceiling on the wire -- white, black, and brown, all somewhat elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the snippets from Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which kicks off on August 2, is called "The Emergence of Similarity".
It's the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harburg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident who was pardoned by Barack Obama just three days before his presidency ended.
By using a computer program to analyze Manning's DNA and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who might have had a genome like this, Dewey-Harborg created a profound, though difficult to grasp, manifesto that focused not only on the plasticity of DNA data - the different ways they are interpreted and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has openly identified as a woman since she was a teenager, was convicted in 2013 of 20 counts, including six counts of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were unavailable, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie of Manning in a platinum wig, apparently uncomfortable, sitting behind the wheel of a car; this photo was associated with her.
In 2015, Dewey-Harmborg successfully completed her 2012 project "Visions of Strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using evidence such as a cigarette butcher and a chewing gum, extracting DNA from the garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article", explained Dewey-Hagborg at the preview of the new exhibition for the press.
At the time, Chelsea was not allowed to visit or take pictures, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait made from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote the comic book "Squeezed Images", illustrated by Shoely Kango, which depicted how the president would later ease Chelsea's punishment and allow her to attend the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama actually decided to release Manning just days after the book came out was a pleasant surprise after seven years of hard labor in a Kansas military prison.
There's something deep and powerful about the exhibition that opens right now when Donald Trump is declaring war on those who are revealing classified information in the government and inventing new ways to ignite the enmity on Twitter that he's meant to mitigate.
When Dewey-Harburg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said "nothing happens by chance".
In a statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's huge signature below (with a heart instead of the dot above the "i" in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic segregation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of C, G and A pencils.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist aptly put it), Dewey-Harburg hoped to show how amazingly similar we are all, at least in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genes don't define who we are, how open genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is", said Dewey-Harborg; her 2007 video work, "False Memories", is also on display here.
"The DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here".
The last part of the exhibition, which was put together in one room, is the aforementioned comic book novel.
It features King Kong Manning above the U.S. Correctional Facility with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they win", it says.
"So never shut up".
"This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me", says the Philadelphia-based artist, who welcomes us.
"I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it".
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet -- as was foreshadowed in the comics -- but when she comes, she'll be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome-simulated screens, gathered like a crowd of protesters.
This was done deliberately, as was the case with the exhibition up to the height of 5'2, Manning's height, where the genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
"I used to hang them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd", says Dewey-Harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her release".
A Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee is wanted by police for murder.
Police say a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee are being sought as suspects in connection with a strangled death in a Chicago luxury room.
According to the Cook County Court of Appeals, warrants were issued Monday for the unlawful premeditated murder of Forty-Four-Year-Old Wyndham Latham and Fifty-Six-Year-Old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranello died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
The police got a call, they came to the apartment complex at Grand Plaza and found the victim with several body wounds.
Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene, and investigators are investigating the knife wound death as a homicide, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latem has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, vice president for communications at the university, said in an email statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was banned from entering Northwestern University's campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation", Kabbage said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
A University and Somerville College spokesman said in an email statement: "We have contacted the UK police and are ready to provide any assistance necessary to the US authorities".
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department communications chief Anthony Gullielli said he strongly advises suspects to surrender to authorities.
"The police have a suspicion of their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are intensifying", Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were contacted by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene awful.
Guellieli said it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on July 27.
He said the video evidence confirms that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were related", said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza's guidance issued a statement to guests stating: "At this time, the police are working on the timeline of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in the fulfilment of the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and conduct the tests together with UKAD (UK anti-doping agency).
The road map of the WADA was updated accordingly", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap on Restoring the Status of Compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for resuming the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of this organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could pose difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future", he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping bodies must publicly acknowledge the results of the WADA-ordered investigation of Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
In this regard, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit what wasn't".
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent anti-doping public commission.
In an interview with the Russian newspaper Rsport on the same morning, Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously been present in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report", Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from conducting doping controls in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggly stated that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" toward restoring its work.
Fire extinguished in 79-story tower in Dubai
The massive fire that broke out in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all the fireworks by 4.00 local time (3.00 Moscow).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The cause of the incident is unknown.
Earlier, it was reported that the 79-story residential skyscraper The Torch was burning in Dubai, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All residents were evacuated in time.
The unimaginable dress of Buzowa shocked fans: pants that don't cover coats
The scandalous host of the reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzov surprised the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with the dance in the coats.
In front of thousands of fans, the newly-appeared singer performed the song "We'll be hot" with Nasty Kudri.
Both girls came on stage in provocative "browns", sewn in such a way that the singer's underwear was visible.
The pants were marked with Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier, it was reported that the changes in Buzov's appearance were commented by a specialist at one of Moscow's plastic surgery clinics.
Stoltenberg admitted to the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by the news service "Radio 4", citing foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO secretary general also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine".
Still, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the US and Russia were at a dangerously low level, and blamed the US Congress for this.
Metro of Yekaterinburg is learning a new way to pay
In October, travel in the Ekaterinburg metro will be possible to pay by bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, general director of the OAO "I-Net" in an interview with the Oblastnaya gazeta.
Our goal is to introduce the same system of subway fare to the 2018 World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the world cup, to be able to use the metro using their bank cards without buying tokens or standing in line", he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the satisfaction level among the employees of her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, dishonest.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"He was never consistent or objective", said Errett, manager of the 75-person San Francisco-based e-commerce company Madison Reed.
So she turned to a third party for help.
There's a new kind of startup in the human resources field that helps companies figure out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that measures employee engagement, they allow companies to do express surveys, contact specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases, allow informants to skip top management and contact directors.
"Now we have health monitoring tools like Strava and Fitbit, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City-based startup Glint, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she had gained a better understanding of what her employees think and feel in three years of using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and surveys by certain teams, the product offers a company heat map and shows visually which units have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest approval ratings, allowing it to understand why.
Companies are slowly realizing that they need to control the workplace, or they will become another Uber who was involved in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, it's a desire to control the situation - an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the online portal Let's talk about payments, the financial technology, global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's declining reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has been a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized staff opinion polls, collect confidential answers in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager gets hurt, the complaints go straight to the board.
"The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is not treating employees well or behaving unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences such as customer boycotts, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinnlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and offer an easy way to contact the company's headquarters.
In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look up the phone number or email address of the head office, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a scary and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal department at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers in offices in other cities or states  such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay  can be detected and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the employees' situation", said Vitrano, who heads the network risk management team Ruby Tuesday.
And we protect our shareholders from employee litigation.
According to Quinnland, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in the Enron deal.
But it wasn't until social media became popular that companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty underwear from spreading viral content online.
Before we started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy, he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that's been approved by the venture capitalists who backed both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total equity to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing amount of research shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In markets with fierce competition, like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the minimum.
Employees want to feel welcomed and valued, and that they dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work for a company, feel that they're being heard and that the work they do is productive, they're more committed to making that company successful", says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make a profit when the businesses in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics promises to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder they're getting support.
As workplace culture experts say, it's important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that change is coming.
And if the change doesn't happen fast enough, or not happen at all, there can be frustration, and employees lose interest.
If you're going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be willing to have 4,000 conversations says Russell Rat, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has had to see companies make mistakes by relying too much on data collection.
Because if you don't go through with it, the staff will be like, "Did you really hear me?
You don't care about that?
If you don't care, why shouldn't I?
According to Errett, the company that now conducts monthly employee surveys at Madison Reed is able to take action on the same day someone reports a problem with Glint.
And after gathering feedback from employees who were unhappy with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and implement communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is learning more about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it retain employees more effectively in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people", said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul , new asphalt is opened on the avenue of the Red Army
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the failure of the asphalt on the Red Army Avenue.
The place where pits once appeared on the recently paved road (the junction with the street of Youth), was decided to "open".
The collapse of a small section of road near the tramway was caused by a landslide in the area of an unused, unmanaged network.
According to Ivan Garmat, deputy chairman of the city's road, transport and communications committee, a detailed investigation will be conducted to investigate the cause of the collapse.
Depending on the outcome, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that the unmanned communication deck will need to be restored and concrete-containing.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins have to work longer because the National Student-Athletic Association canceled training twice a day.
It's getting closer to 11 p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles are hanging out to chat on one side of the new team's training fields on campus.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts, bare their backs, glowing with sweat after a stressful first day of sports camp.
For many team players, those minutes of idleness are a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer training will return to the hostel after a three-hour training session to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning will return to Wasserman Football Centre for a 6:30 p.m. meeting.
Just before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, "These guys are going to have a meat cutting game for the next three days".
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their working days  at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the start of the first three training sessions for the UCLA team was set for 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of not having two training sessions a day was more days with one training session, and Bruins moved the start of the camp by almost a week compared to last year and was training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of Sea at Westwood.
According to the schedule, they'll have 18 practice sessions until August 20 inclusive before they begin the official training for the first game of the season against Texas A&M University in September.
Mora said he supports the change in rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that he has added another item to the tight schedule of players.
"For three or four days, we give them this huge load, it's a serious test", Mora said.
And they just got over it, they work, they're great guys.
I think when we make it to Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great.
When the camp is over, the University of California, Los Angeles will be making the practice closed; it's not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that was already being bombed by footballs that had overrun the defensive grid behind the gates.
The Bruins players are scheduled to book a hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll have security", Mora said.
This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger by assuming that someone could rent a room, sit there and videotape the workout.
If you have a training video, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security in parking lot number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.
All victims of the attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the St. Petersburg metro attack in April have been discharged from hospitals.
This was reported by the press service of the vice governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the data at the end of July, three people remained in the hospitals, reports "TV Center".
The explosion in the St. Petersburg metro area occurred on April 3 this year.
The bomb was detonated by the suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, including the performer himself.
11 people, including the alleged organizer Abroor Azimov, have been arrested in the criminal case.
Recall that the previous day, Rospotrebnadzor recommended the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook is stepping up fact-checking to fight fake news
Facebook will send more suspicious texts to independent experts and showcase their findings under original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible misstatements, send them to verification, and possibly show the fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages ahead of the presidential election in May, and in Germany before the September election they announced support for a plan to fine social media if they do not promptly remove hate-mongering posts.
Facebook announced in a separate German-language statement Thursday that it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing what messages are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share", Sarah Sue, Facebook's news feed manager, wrote in her blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "linked articles" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the issue of fake news.
Creating a comic book: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, the tiny castle of Scotney was featured in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s it served as a retreat for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy home in the Bayoule River Valley in Kent County, he's been watching the turbulent history around him, and now he's inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with blond hair and a penchant for historical documents, for comic books.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago", he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand".
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells the story of families who lived in Scotland; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book by Rhodes to be based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories", a collection of British Library documents; this project unexpectedly touched him to the depths of his soul.
"I could have just grabbed a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700's by a double agent working on Jacobites", he says.
"This is his fingerprint".
And the letters always smell like smoke, because back then, they lit a fire to light it.
And 300 years from now, in the future, you'll feel like you're there too.
Oh, I love the archives!"
For a man so passionate about old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and living in a castle for four months ("I've been a little bit over there, honestly") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent all day studying the "new" Victorian castle, going through the archives and examining the many treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of gynecologists on the walls or bottles lying in the pit for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of an old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes artists working on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write".
The history of Scotney Castle is not well studied, because the National Trust did not gain full access to it until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassie, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff was just beginning to look into the archive, which he describes as "something that the aristocracy had been plunging into the attic for centuries".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned the land: "You think land disputes are boring", says Rhodes, "but this is the place where two families fought over the hedge.
It happens, guys!"
In some stories, the castle becomes a starting point for broader research into English history: for example, in "The Labbotnik", the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is a record of a castle mutiny in 1380 in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex", says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought that the uprising was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the castle's history, such as "The Priest", which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was kept secret by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler", about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered a few years later when the coffin was excavated).
The Darreles were the favourite of the Rhodes family of all Scottish settlers. "The gentlemen seemed to be a complete fraud, constantly in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrelas have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women - I imagine they were a company of cute guys who could take care of the heirs of great fortunes".
After completing his work at the Rhodes Castle, he seeks other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish hinterland, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamyanmäki - a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was again covered with forest.
But Scotney is still a special place for him.
"I felt sad to leave", he says.
"I felt like I had to go back to the real world".
Fifteen of the largest banks are choosing Russia
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha-bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FK "Optykie", seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of the organizations that have left the RBA will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a solution - all the banks that have announced their break with the RBA are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, recognized, by the way, as the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy for the number of draft laws prepared.
The conflict within the ARB was initiated during a discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council was considering new bills, in particular, proposing a new classification of banks according to the size of the chartered capital.
Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that the association believes the bill is in the interest of the largest banks, which are trying to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their customers.
Among other complaints, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify revoking licenses from some banks, which, however, was opposed by the representative of the Central Bank: many of the heads of the penalised banks, in particular Vнешпромбанк, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
This exchange of mutually exclusive opinions, which is very sensitive to the relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment, seems to have been a visible reason for the 15 largest banks to start preparing to join the "Russia" association, stating that "the efficiency of the banking community is low and there is no constructive dialogue within the banking community".
The depositors will be better off .
What's the end of it?
Let us answer immediately the main question that arises in the slightest failure or conflict in or near the banking sector: the depositors are not in danger, rather, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
"Russia" is headed by Anatoly Aksakov, known for his care in everything that concerns the interests of banks and their customers, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the Central Bank leadership is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are through expert assessments of "regions".
In terms of personnel and organization, obviously, there will be no big upheavals.
The Bank is undoubtedly in a difficult financial and managerial situation after losing such powerful and influential players with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, the oldest organization in the banking community, founded in 1991, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the money-credit sector in general.
It is not possible to say that even in the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members on any conditions, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatolia Aksakov ("may, too much will be wanted"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day representatives of the banks that left the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association "Russia".
Their proposal is to strengthen the voice of bankers on the Association Council and to focus more on new banking technologies.
Negotiations are underway, proposals are being studied, and the agenda for the extraordinary association congress, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum, is being prepared.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "he does not hold back", called the possible new head of the updated association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highlighting his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently on holiday in Crimea, plans to take a day off his vacation and come to Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia", where the issue of the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia" is to be considered.
The entry of petrol engine cars into Russia 's major cities will not be restricted
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Assaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-powered cars into major Russian cities will not be restricted.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually raise the environmental class.
And then the concept of going to zero emissions right away.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is, what year?
It's the same thing as a slogan phrase, let's ban it.
Where and when?
- What?
Shall we lock down the whole town?
"I don't know, maybe in 20 years, that's what's going to happen", Prime quoted the minister as saying.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was tasked with examining the proposals on possible state support for electric transport, presented to the government by the general director of PАО KamAZ Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, the newspaper reported, is the use of DCV cars in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has announced that a new immigration plan will be adopted in the United States, which will change the rules for obtaining green cards.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the United States grants green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the financial resources to support themselves, and have the skills to benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media.
The advent of sex robots is real, and it should worry us.
Before we could think that 2017 could be any worse, a new report came out about the technological advances in sex robot manufacturing.
I know.
Sex robots are the focus right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, says we need to take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the socks and the type of nails.
"People are whining about it, but companies are already sending a lot of them to consumers, and we're going to see a lot more of them soon", Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their bloated counterparts into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and almost human replicas, controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the robot's eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of its nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" that would make the Stepford Woman seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become silicone-skinned robots.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize the robots to the quality they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion that come with a programmed personality - for example, Cold Farra seems shy, and Wild Wendy is "bold".
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your needs", reports True Companion enthusiastically.
So she likes what you like, doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She's in a mood that changes throughout the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be "in the mood!"
There's a lot of concern about sex robots -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but most of all, the submissive image of women, the association with rape that causes Cold Light to take over.
The True Companion website compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't a man have Roxxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a shift away from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will not buy sex robots, of course, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what we hear from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the age we live in.
And many people aren't bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's no coincidence that these complex sex robots came about at a time when women's rights around the world were under threat, when there's a president in the White House who boasts of harassing women.
The scariest thing about the TV series "The Handmaid's Tale" is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the crushed eyes, but just how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big right now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical resemblance to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like humans to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's the "character" that makes robots look different from real women.
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life, no biography -- nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maidens.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not be helping our national team in the European basketball championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the portal BeBasket by the general manager of the blue-yellow teams, Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won't be coming because of family circumstances.
We're going to EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will give opportunities for the development of our young players", he said.
I remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian national team took the record sixth place at the Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time entered the world championship of basketball, where the "yellow blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the US native scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 selections and gave 5 passes.
Jeter has stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since leaving the post of head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left that position in 2015.
The men's Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play its group matches on the Promised Land.
The custodians of Eugen Murzin will have five matches in group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men's national team played two control matches, losing to the Dutch and Belarusians.
The great feat of Trump?
It seems reasonable to portray Mitt Romney as himself.
In the Trump era, the common ground was that the political disputes that polarized the American electorate had broken up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers have been columning about how to deal with the terrible relatives who vote for Trump.
I think we're all so tense we're about to explode.
There's less talk of Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago, who was long on the knife with the Republicans in her family, came to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knew, including the Republican brother she had been arguing with about politics for decades, suddenly and oddly ended up on the same side.
After dinner, that's certainly good; but I can't help but think that in a broader context, it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has inhaled power into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule could move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll stop being struck by his outcomes.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the backdrop of his standards, will suddenly be shown to be a model of common sense.
I've gotten myself to what I miss so much today about the old-fashioned craziness of Mitt Romney -- with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax rate (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) -- compared to Trump, both of which seem to be a very minor evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his head to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we took the kids to a carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York City Department of Parks and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the fiberglass images on the central drum - make-up clowns and animals looking at themselves in horror, bent, and bent - are extremely ominous, and the sound of the music, oddly enough, is delightful.
So many famous things in this city disappoint: the views from the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of buildings are too big to cause a tremor, and the reality of the city is falling short of its dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I am still reliving the day I learned that the Swiss Cottage area is not really a Swiss shale (Ye Olde Swiss Cottage theme pub is not counted), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old, an eleven-year-old and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could put the carousel on the scoreboard, I'd put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars before I could run a terminal card.
In a coffee shop on my street corner, the same plus the option of having a 15% tea rate is for a bar order.
The result is not only a slowdown in the idea-neutral interaction, but also a personal attitude to a situation that doesn't involve it.
The poor saleswoman at the department store smiled confused as I was exhausted from evaluating my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison for a second visit to the doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of wrist cuts, which the prison administration said he suffered from falling into his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of manslaughter after the prosecutor's office appealed the initial conviction for manslaughter.
He killed Steencamp early on Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her multiple times through the bathroom door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he thought his girlfriend was a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The prosecutor's office has announced its intention to file another protest, this time against Pretorius' six-year term, which she says is too soft.
The Attorney General's Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be heard this year.
The term of office of the Prefecture may be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspected journalist in beat-up is selected for a non-retirement subscription
The capital's law enforcement authorities have chosen a non-retirement subscription for the man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razozjayev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Irina Volk.
"In the course of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Battle") against a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of culture and recreation named after Gorky, the suspect was given a restraining order in the form of a subscription about not leaving and proper behavior", - said Volk.
The Interior Ministry spokeswoman added that an administrative protocol was drawn up for the suspect's disobedience to police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast of the VDV Day, a sober man approached the correspondent and hit him in the face.
As it turned out, the bully had nothing to do with the Air Force.
According to Razovzjayev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Moskovich.
Two Bulgarian citizens arrested in Greece for illegally parking in tents
According to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegally parking in tents.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people, including two Bulgarians, were arrested in Sitonia.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to the TV channel Би-Ти-Ви that Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone caught parking in a place not intended for this purpose.
The tests will be conducted throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accused US vice president of "cold war" rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is regrettable that Washington is falling deeper into the primitive ideologized stamps of the Cold War, which are completely cut off from reality", the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
This is how the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence's words about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcefully cross the borders he said in Podgorice.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructive nature of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the ambiguity of the thesis about the allegedly non-alternative accession of all of Southeast Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that the United States violated international law by using force to push Kosovo away from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop harassing Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness for constructive work together, on mutual consideration of interests", the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Felder was injured in a car accident with "speed" in Moscow
The accident occurred in the Moscow suburb of Stupinos, as a result of a collision of a stranger with a carriage "Accelerated assistance" injured a physician.
Today around 08:10 Moscow, a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupinos in Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the car "quickly" turned", - TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Moscow region.
Law enforcement officers are working at the scene, and the circumstances are being investigated.
In Odessa, a woman threw her newborn son out of the building site, wrapped in a cellophane package.
On the evening of August 3, the police department received a message from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unbuilt private house.
"Law enforcement and doctors arrived at the scene and immediately took the child to the medical facility", the Odessa police chief said.
The doctors determined that the boy was born hours before he was discovered, which is evidenced by the presence of a spinal cord.
During the first-order operational investigations, the identity of the woman was established.
It's also been determined that the woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the head, the family was not in the field of law enforcement before and was not taken into account.
The police are currently investigating the circumstances and reasons that compelled the woman to commit the act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is now under medical supervision.
As reported earlier, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her unborn child into a garbage can.
Greg Leps: "I'm a fighter, even though 55 is not 30".
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the ceremony, the singer spoke to the "Izvestiy" viewer.
I remember your "colonel" being celebrated.
A special tent in the "Luzniks", Gloria Geynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow river.
You must have been pretending to want to spend your next five years.
Did you make it?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I worked hard, toured the country three times, gave 120 to 130 concerts a year.
He's released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not the same person I was 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not to be misled.
Singing like I did in my 30s is getting harder.
I'm still fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm getting on a different level.
You're recording a new album with them, your first in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it now.
Actually, we've already recorded it in my studio and we're sending it to LA for reporting.
It's called "Why Are You So Serious?" after a song of the same name that he co-wrote with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we get the video.
And we'll release the album in November, for my anniversary concert series at Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
Your new record is handled by the great American drummer Chris Coleman.
You think you wanted to get him on your tour?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the world's greatest drummers today.
He used to come to my studio, record his music.
I asked him to join my band, and Jeremy Colson, a well-known drummer who plays on various projects, offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was a monthly fee of between €35,000 and €45,000.
I thought I'd find some decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malyshev.
It 's better to feed your own .
Sometimes I want to get to one of them, not for nothing.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly cited internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after hearing his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists came along with different performance techniques".
Your album is being made in L.A., American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the States?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
I'm not doing anything right now, to be honest.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get to America.
I told you I was studying there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful you are.
We're not stupid, but we don't have that experience, schools.
For 70 years, our performers of popular music have not had the same challenges that American musicians have always had.
They were looking for the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has denied me entry for ten years.
But I'm still going to apply for a visa every year to the British Embassy to be allowed back in and most importantly to work there.
The rest of Europe is very kind to me.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco in August, not a booked one, but a poster, right?
Yeah, there's a good sports hall in Monte Carlo, and I've been there once.
They've just invited me back, and as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert are sold out.
You're going to the Lyma Waikoule Rally, which starts on July 20th in Jurmal?
She invited me, and I, of course, answered.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman, who can present herself with a beautiful vocals and even a whisper.
After touring and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you're going to want to turn to Vladimir Vysotsky's work.
You already have two albums of his songs in your discography.
When's the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be done completely differently.
I want to record about 80 or 90 songs of Highotsky in the same way he did.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'll be accompanied by our famous musician, Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to get Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum on the album.
I've been talking to him about this, we're good, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it goes.
You and Boris Grebenshnikov's songs have been gradually incorporated into your repertoire.
Maybe you can record an album of his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I've been to him a few times and asked if I could sing some of his songs.
He said, "Gregory, I write songs to make them play".
Please try, sing.
I guess it's interesting to record an album like this.
I don't have a similar task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might do a project like this.
Unless you're focused on your production center.
I assume you haven't realized his potential yet, signed all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I wish I had under my wing, but they're independent, established people.
You mean Sergei Lazarov?
Serge is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now is Alexander Panayotov, who I led in The Voice.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, singers like that are rare.
It would be a real shame if he didn't reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a recording, making music videos.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center, buying them songs, crying to poets, sometimes their tracks get in the rotation of TV and radio.
If they don't reach great heights, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a recording album, a few clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I'm not gonna insist that they return the money they put into it.
Although I'd be happy if one of them made a commercial success and paid me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to shut down anyone.
Let everyone work, get through, prove it like I once did.
If you're offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guaranteed entry, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
It's mostly closed-door events.
And as for the big tour...
I am a citizen of my country, a Russian, and I believe I was flying to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If tomorrow they tell me to fly to another place for the sake of the state, I will.
And I don't care what other bloggers and critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that this situation has happened in Ukraine.
Because I believe we are one people and we should be together.
I'm sorry that's unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40 or 50 concerts in Ukraine a year.
I've never met you before.
A very grateful audience.
And he has collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Annie Lorac, Svetlana Loboda, Artem Loyk...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and I'm really sorry that they can't fully show their talent to the broad Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, like Slav Vakarchuk, and give him a concert.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrei Ohlopkov was dropped from the space shuttle
As it became known to "Ъ", the technical director of the East Spaceport, Andrey Ohlopkov, began work at the State Space Research and Production Center (GKNPC) named after Hrunichev.
He was previously de facto engaged in the construction of the East Spaceport, but due to differences with the leadership of the Center for the Exploitation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Films, where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Ohlopkov will not have a changeover: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functional will be distributed among the units of the CENKI.
About the fact that the technical director of the Eastern and the deputy general director of the CENKI for technological development Andrei Ohlopkov moved to work in the GKNPC named after Hrunichev, "Ъ" told top managers of several enterprises of space industry, as well as a government employee.
"He's been working for a few weeks", the company said.
The CENCI failed to get an immediate comment on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was unavailable for comment.
However, the information "Community" has been officially confirmed in the DNCPC.
He has decided to move to the position of director of production coordination, - said the company. - Andrei Ohlopkov has fully fulfilled the task of ensuring the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostok spaceport.
Mr. Ohlopkov joined the CENKI in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and at Plesetsk - the "northern" spaceport, holding the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Ohlopkov became a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, regional merchants received state orders for the withdrawal, but failed to fulfill their commitments to clean up separate parts of the rocket-carrying missiles in Arhangel region and Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The task of developing technology was assigned to him by the Central Intelligence Agency and extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a spaceport in the Far East.
The head of the Federal Space Agency Oleg Ostapenko said in an interview with the "Kommunist" that the situation in the East "was critical in October 2013".
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made in planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To get the project started by the end of the year, construction was completed six months early and the deadline was moved from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, the experts of the Central Intelligence Agency began to install parallel technology equipment on unbuilt sites.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Ohlopkov.
Despite the risks and the delay (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says a source at the spaceport: "Otherwise we would not have carried out any launches from the East, but would have been building".
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversaw the creation of the spaceport, jokingly called Andrei Ohlopkov his "space Susani", but it was almost always from him that he asked for information about the construction process.
Mr. Ohlopkov remembered the straightforwardness of his remarks: for example, in an interview with "Ъ", he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstruy) of the status of the sole contractor in the East and to work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of the Special Construction?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, the CENKI has taken on the role of general contractor to complete construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex by the planned fourth quarter of the launch.
According to the "Ъ", the reason for Mr. Ohlopkov's move to a new job was disagreements with the CENKI leadership regarding the ways of completing the construction of the structures and complexes of the spaceport, as well as the methods of working with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be better for everyone", says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
A government official, in turn, called the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, finding an equivalent replacement will be difficult".
According to the "Ъ", this will not be necessary: the position of technical director of the spaceport will be abolished, and its functions will be distributed among the units of the CENKI.
Music schools will offer two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to take two courses at once.
According to Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Sviatoslav Golubenko, for this you can re-read the students repetitive disciplines, and the issue of paying for the rest of the classes on the second speciality to be solved with the help of special grants, reports "RIA Novosti".
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we will develop a mechanism with the expert community that will allow you to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education", said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Children's Talk" with the pupils of the Sirius Children's Center, Maria Andreeva, a student, said she was forced to pay for the secondary subjects at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said she was studying violin and piano and had won prizes in both competitions.
The head of state recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
17-year-old Russian man caught climbing a wall in Mexico
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man, Kirill N., was arrested after climbing a high-rise building's roof from a wall, reports El Universal.
The incident happened in Mexico City.
A young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed a three-meter-high fence into the Nestle office complex and climbed onto one of its towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance or rope.
We've got a young man on the roof.
Public safety officials dropped him on the ground in a helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They're trying to find out if the boy is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, videos of a young man climbing a mountain have become popular on the Internet.
Users called the boy "spider man".
According to the media, such experiments are his hobby.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate can help ease the symptoms.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest otherwise: A diet rich in protein and dairy products may help ease symptoms in those with inflammatory bowel disease.
This is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leading to colic and belly swelling, chronic or bloody vomiting, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid in the protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
Leading researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the gut control the passage of harmful microbes from food into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much distorted toward inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacterium in their intestines have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to start these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal gut microbiome - and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells they had".
He suggested that the same thing would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could promote a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barragánvas, a researcher who studied the tolerance-boosting types of immune cells, found that one group of mice had these cells, and another group that was of the same line but was kept separate had none.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the microbiomes of the intestines of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mouse gut cells was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found in mice that had immune cells, but none in mice that didn't.
Mice raised in a sterile environment that didn't have a good microbiome and didn't develop this type of immune cell got L. reuteri, and they had immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells secreted from mice.
The immune cells have turned into tolerance-boosting cells.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it was a byproduct of tryptophan processing known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were cut in half, the number of cells also doubled.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragán explains that humans have the same elevated cell tolerance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gut.
It is not known whether the tryptophan by-products of L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans as well as in mice, but defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She says: "We may need to improve the development of these cells, as the inflammatory processes on the intestinal surface depend on them.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an expansion of their population".
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has hired a genius named Nemanja Matić.
Manchester United have hired the legendary Nemanja Matitch, according to Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, who was bought for £40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last preseason game of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to break through when they wanted to.
However, as Matitch did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he was seriously lacking in preparation for the game, and he only lasted 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires finishing before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in how he thinks, he thinks football", said Mourinho.
We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later.
Like Matitch, his new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began forming his main squad by the start of the next season.
The newspaper Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four", he added.
I'd be even happier if they got me four out of four, but they've already done a lot for me.
Former leaders of the Lithuanian Social Democrats urge them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkявичюс and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former chairman of the Seimas from the social democrats Cheslovas Yurshens appealed to their fellow party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the Parliamentary Gazette, because of tensions with partners - the Union of Peasants and the "greens" - the Social Democratic Party has initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
Three senior experienced comrades wrote to their fellow party members with an open letter, which said: "The disappointment of the party comrades with the election results is clear, but the coalition with the 'peasants' has created for us, although not very easy, the conditions for further pursuit of the goals of social justice, which are provided for by our initiative in the government's programme, and for maintaining the political dominance of the centre-left over the right parties".
According to former party leaders, the discussion so far "has been dominated by emotionally based expression of opinion without specific arguments".
The letter's authors fear that their party's unthinking actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
An invalid Anton Mamayev was fined
The Moscow court has reduced the sentence of invalid carriage driver Anton Mamayev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, the sentence was released from SIZO by the decision of the Timirayev court.
At the same time, the Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and the kidnapping of a motorcycle from a former fighter of the special forces.
The Moscow court has eased the sentence of Anton Mamayev to 200 thousand rubles.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility", - explained "Ъ" press secretary of the Mosgorod Ulyana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account Mamayev's health condition, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of any aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which a sentence can be imposed below the lower limit.
As for Assistant Mamayev Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would be the basis for changing the severity of the offence and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself said he was unhappy with the decision of the Mosgorod.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be to justify, to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out appeals of the sentence in the Cassation Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights", he told RIA Novosti.
Recall that Anton Mamayev, a 28-year-old Moskovite with spinal muscular atrophy, was a criminal case victim in the fall of last year.
The disabled man claims to have bought a motorcycle from a friend for 160,000 rubles to sell.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, including a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Serostanov had taken their property from them, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years in prison with a sentence of a general penalty in a colony (according to Article 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled person was placed in SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the human rights commissioner under President Tatyan Moskalkov joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamayev was released from SIZO by the decision of the same Timiryasev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Mosgorod.
UNF will prepare a report on ecology
The final "Action Forum" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be dedicated to environmental issues, a source in the UNF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexey Anisimov.
According to him, the "front-women" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of domestic ecology, as well as propose a strategy for their solution.
The report to the head of state will contain a "deep analysis" of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the news agency, the UNF's final forum will be held in the fall.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - it is usually timed to the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key UNF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The conference will conclude in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
Based on the proposals that were and will be made at these events, we will form systematic proposals to solve environmental problems", the UNF interviewer told Izvestia.
Co-chairman of the Central Staff of the movement Olga Timofeeva, head of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the "frontlines" will report to the head of state about the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNF Action Forum will most likely be combined.
In a year, we've grown into a powerful team of environmental experts, we've seen loopholes in legislation, we've stopped dozens of violations.
All of this will be part of a report we're preparing for the president as leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the frontline staff also report on the work on priority projects of the UNF, - Olga Timofeeva told "Izvestia".
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental protection, ecology and transportation, Sergei Ivanov, will be invited to the forum.
He has previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of the Environment will be in history, and the most important thing to do today is to start environmental protection mechanisms so that they work for years to come.
So that these questions do not fall out of the agenda", added Olga Timofeeva.
Head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute of Social Research (EISI) Andrei Kolyadin noted: raising environmental issues, the UNF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts have proposed at various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the president, - said Andrei Kolyadin to "Izvestia".
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which could give the regions an additional boost for development.
In the future, with the help of UNF, the regions will be able to lobby not only to solve their environmental problems, but also to develop ecotourism, - added the expert.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashiye (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill on the prohibition of open coal transshipment in settlements has already been drafted, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue lies in the future law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
The decisions taken by the state need to be clearly implemented, - says Leonid Bochin, head of the charity foundation "Ecology for all".
Member of the SPH, head of the non-governmental organization "Grinпис России" Sergey Zыпленков in a conversation with "Izvestiya" stressed that for successful resolution of environmental problems, a responsible approach of society and business is needed, but legislative efforts are few.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergei Zyplenkov.
The expert stressed that the trend towards environmental legislation being violated is a cost-effective solution for businesses needs to be reversed.
A British inventor turned on a microchip to get into a house and a car by shaking his hand.
The British inventor was the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could open the door of his home, walk into an office, and even start a car with a simple handshake.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has created a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and now through his company BioTek offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at Royal Hospital in Winchester, to ensure that the injection procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is like a microchip that's injected into cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northerm also replaces the locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible ones at a price of £300 per lock.
A married father of one has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 which is activated when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House receipt cost taxpayers thousands of dollars .
According to the military's records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One when the president is on board, became a central element of the July 17 event at the White House, where American construction programs were demonstrated.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials have reviewed technology products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was placed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi truck.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for the helicopter management, the White House Military Administration ordered the helicopter's presence in a private order, or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an unusual event.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware, because this is an unusual event that's been widely covered in the press", commander HMX-1 wrote in an email to his chief, first deputy chief of naval aviation, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the event, scheduled for 3 p.m., and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the hours of operation restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether a second crew was required as a result.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the event is contrary to this order.
"We asked if this was a violation of Hatch's law, among other things, and we were told no", the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have anywhere else to go", replied the deputy chief.
The event was declared by the White House as an official event, and Hatch's law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance the health care reform that was being worked out in the Senate at the time, and praised the efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of airships known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are advised to use them for travel.
But asking them for photos is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussion in February when the presidential plane flew in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about his predecessor using the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made in America' show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials", said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and the South Lawn to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House with an accuracy of one inch.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 had 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight performed for the event was made in America, and the crew was charged for the necessary training flights for a month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 extra hours that day as part of the non-presidential support tasks.
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not pay for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of the company Sikorsky reported that the company did not participate in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the South lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't keep track of the presidential flights budget, and it's difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Defense Department's 2017 fiscal year hourly rates, the Defense Department's rate of compensation for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit's records record that the aircraft's time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its base at the Quantico Marine Air Base in Virginia.
The White House claims the actual cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
"It is a mistake to calculate the cost to taxpayers based on the approximate rate of compensation", says Walters.
These exemplary rates include personal allowance, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allowances.
According to a 2015 study by the REND Corporation, the compensation rates do not include the cost of personnel, but actually take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and expenses specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was speaking out in support of using the helicopter for the event.
The idea is to showcase this week's American-made stuff, Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they're contributing to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked so hard to build.
So, of course, it's quite appropriate to pay attention to that.
It was unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while patrolling the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely sitting in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of company products.
I know Sikorsky very well, the president said.
Moscow will grant grants for the resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Every year, the "Save Life" grants will be allocated to the resuscitation and intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The money will go to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the city clinical hospital named after Yudin.
During the visit, he presented a letter of thanks to the trauma orthopedist Victor Proko, under whose leadership the most complex surgery to reconstruct the teen's foot was performed.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to grant grants annually to the intensive care units of the city's clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the clinical hospital named after Yudine is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has been equipped with new, modern equipment that allows doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the grounds of the Colomene rural hospital.
The medical facility currently has over a thousand patients.
Apart from the intensive care unit and the hospital, there are also daycare units.
The hospital has a staff of 2,800 people.
The total area of the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February , the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project to organize short-term stays (SPCs).
They're designed for relatively small operations.
The surgical procedures involve the use of advanced medical equipment, which can significantly shorten the rehabilitation time of patients.
After surgery, they spend only a few hours in the hospital.
In the first half of this year alone, 36 thousand patients were treated in a hospital called Yudin.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
National Bank of Ukraine reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications to buy the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This is reported on Friday, August 4, TASS, citing a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, the package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Victor Prokopeni for the agreement of indirect (through the Parisetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
"No documents from other potential investors to buy Sberbank shares in the NBU", - noted in the message.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenia withdrew his application to buy the subsidiary structure of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to buy the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank to Russian businessmen Said Guteriev and Grigory Husselnikov.
The regulator justified its decision by not providing the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
The Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Guteriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guteriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
They're banned from withdrawing capital from the country for a year in favor of mother organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, participate, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial councils, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The election can only be fully representative if women are fully involved and included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban are threatening to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to advisory roles.
This year's election marks the first peaceful transition from one democratically elected government to another.
Hayes said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

Venice has tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened the penalties for swimming in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
Walking around the city in a bathtub or naked bag will now be fined 200 euros.
People who organize a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas will be asked for 100 euros, according to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.

The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice Tourism Adviser Paula Mar, the information about the fines will be sent to the embassies of the offenders' home countries to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach", she said.
In April, the city announced plans to limit tourist flows.
Venice has already successfully restricted the number of tourists visiting the city centre.
Instead of 100,000 people attending the Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend.
In addition, a moratorium on the establishment of new fast food hotels and restaurants in the historic part of Venice has been imposed.

The SF released Ozerov from the position of head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the Chairman of the Committee on Defence and Security Viktor Ozerov and dismissed him from this position.
He remains a senator from the Khabarov region.
The statement asking to release him from his position Ozerov wrote last week.
He explained his decision to rotate and to want to "change the rhythm of life".
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not an instant.
Victor Ozerov has been representing the Khabarov Krai legislative assembly in the Russian Federation since 1996.
The Senate has been the head of the Defense and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for residents and for Buryatia's producers
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Buryatia Republic (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1st, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial customers is down 25%.
The Federal antitrust service of the country in accordance with the Resolution of the Russian Federation Government "On amendments to the Rules of the wholesale market of electric energy and power and to the aggregate forecast balance of electric energy production and supply (power) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia for the subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat's commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will make life much easier for small and medium enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have been pushing the thresholds of Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to level the region with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power stations in Ankara, which originates from Baikal, for which Buryatia is the main water collection territory.
And it wasn't until this year that the move began.
In March, tariffs on electricity for the population of the republic were reduced from 4,24 rubles per kWh to 3,93 rubles per kWh, or 7,3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of the wholesale market price zones, for which the features of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, it is up to the industrial consumers.
Analysts say that this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt hour.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date of the new tariff moves towards a decline for Buryatia.
Scooter didn't fear the Prosecutor General's office and flew to Crimea
Legend of electronic dance music, Scooter has arrived in Crimea without fear of threats from the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office.

Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, the festival guests will be Sergey Galanin and his group "SergyGha", as well as Garik Sukachev with "Brigada C".
The Moscow metro will host the premiere of the new season of "Game of Thrones"

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about investments at McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
The union is demanding guarantees from the managers of biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to the Glasgow plant.
GMB's Scottish office reports that the company has been silent about future investment in the Tolkrosse facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years it has invested more than £5 million in the facility.
The company adds that if there are any changes in the work of the facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know about them.
In a letter to the head of the company's facility, GMB's Scottish office demanded McVitie's reaction to concerns that funding would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the facility's CEO on business needs and investment plans for the future of Tolcross".
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in the local community and in Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in a highly unemployed and deprived area.
So, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living standards and chronic production decline, East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of McVitie's factory.
According to a Pladis spokeswoman, the CEO of the Tolkrosse facility received a letter from GMB's Scottish office yesterday, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our ongoing cooperation with the employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tolcroix, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to the staff about how, like all companies operating in the most competitive and volatile economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions  and this applies to all our facilities and areas of activity  to stay competitive.
 Over the past few years we have invested over £5 million in our Tolkrosse facility, particularly in production lines and performance improvements
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a manufacturing facility, and if there are any changes to the work at this facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know about it.
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the cabinet of ministers should join the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Chemical Company (EOPC), but no one would give instructions to Gazprom, as would Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the conflicts.
The Head of State pointed out that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHK puts the project's implementation in jeopardy.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue is ongoing.
Gazprom is offering to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources", - added Sechin.
We will remind you that Rosneft asked for permission to use gas from the Gazprom field in Kirina, located on the Sahalin shelf.
In June, Gazprom said that talks on the issue were ongoing and that "there are no sharp angles".
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
The La Liga player may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record-setting raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club was poised to break the world record for the cost of the transfer, more than double the previous mark associated with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as the PJS offers him a salary of over 500,000 pounds a week in net worth.
It is known that Barcelona were angry at the way the offer was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club's leadership insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned about this three years ago by the president of the USSR?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matyuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a stark warning to any club that wanted to lure one of the best players in the Premier League.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will go against them, we will make offers to their players", Al-Helaifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they're gonna have consequences.
It seems that Barcelona crossed that line when the Spanish club expressed interest in the midfielder from the PSL Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not release the Italian player under any conditions, and now, it is likely that Barcelona is feeling the consequences of its offer in the form of losing one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin has ordered the payments to the victims of the forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the financial assistance to be allocated to the victims of the forest fires and to the construction of new housing.
I'd like to hear how the work is going today.
I'm asking you to report on the status of payments and compensation to the injured citizens.
I have a little bit of a misunderstanding.
"I would like to ask my colleagues about how much money has been allocated", Putin said at a meeting with regional leaders in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Nature Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Russian President's representative in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Meniylo, and the head of the Baikal branch of the FGBU "Glavrybvod", Leonid Mihaillik.
They told me about the lake cleanup.
They then showed the young in an open container next to the container they had prepared for breeding.
First, Putin released a few boys from the sack.
Then I pulled a special lever on the container lid and let the rest out.
During the visit, the leader also ordered to understand the environmental situation in Baikal and build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and another volume is supposedly provided.
"I want to understand what is happening with funding", the Russian leader stressed.
Recall that during the forest fires of 2017, burning villages in Buryatia, Irkutsk region, houses and buildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, they offered to send Russians to prison for illegally crossing the border
The Ukrainian parliament has registered a draft law that would impose criminal penalties on Russians for illegally crossing the Ukrainian border.
According to RT, the document, registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian parliament, implies a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens trying to enter the country illegally.
It is noted that for a repeat offence or an act committed by a group of persons, the prison term can be extended to five years.
If the offender is detained at the border with a weapon, the prison term for the offender will be increased to eight years.
Earlier, it was reported that Ukrainian border guards detained Ukrainians trying to enter Russia outside the established checkpoints.
Magnet is out of stock.
The second-largest food retailer Magnit has announced the opening of three new Magnit-Opts test stores, designed for small wholesale purchases.
The company's press release says that the possibility of buying goods at retail remains.
New format stores were opened in Krasnodar, Saratov and Ulyanovsk.
