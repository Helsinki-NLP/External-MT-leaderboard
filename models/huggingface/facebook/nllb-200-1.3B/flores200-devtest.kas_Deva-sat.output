Furthermore, this action has the associated consequences of failure: a depression of the mind, a lack of motivation, and ultimately death.
The most common nutrient for plants is protein in plants, but it is difficult to digest for smaller primates unless it is stored.
To top it off, the animal's body (ray, termites, and thul) is not only easily digested but also produces large amounts of protein containing all the essential immune acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if the scene or the adder of our "protein problem" is somewhat solved by the chips on the table.
