Since I did not receive an answer, I wrote her again.
What would you like to say about this?
You think this is a trap?
People, stop killing each other.
I wonder if Tom and Mary planned to do that.
I borrowed Tom a car.
I don't think I could spend six hours alone with you.

Could you stop, please?
They were following you.
I'm waiting for your answer.

Wake the children up.
We drank a lot.
Who else did you tell?
Tom lost his voice.
Is that your beer?
Security is not guaranteed.
I didn't see them.
Tom will dance.
Give me your wallet.
You have nothing.
Even a teacher can be wrong.
We were disappointed in it.
Tom may already be dead.
I'm gay, you know.
Why am I so tired?
Wait till my exams are over.
How many children do you have?
I'm not done with Tom yet.
There are thousands of Pashtuns in Ukraine.

I wonder if she'll recognize me after all these years.
I'm very lazy sometimes.
I know you don't trust us.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next week.
Tom should have waited.
You ate.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
I'm afraid I won't finish my report in time.
It's unlikely I'll be there tonight.
I don't trust you.
She travels the world.
The boys are fine.
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she should do it.

No one called Tom.
No one knows what's going to happen.
We're always waiting for something.
Thank you for your attention.
I didn't apologize.
Many young people went to Hawaii this summer.
Tom is my twin brother.
There are no comments at this time.
Tom, I want to stay with you.
Don't resist.
You'll pay for this!
Do you understand me?

It's not his handwriting.
You can say anything you want.
That's enough for one day.
Tom gave his heart to Mary.
I don't think Tom will remember me.
He speaks German.
Tom isn't as busy as you are.
Why do you have so many shoes?
You are very brave.
I'm totally naked.
No one has heard of my country.
He became a national hero.
Did Tom say where he did it?
We are learning Chinese.
How do I get to the other side?
Do we have a choice?
I'm sure you will.
Let me see.
Tom began to realize what was happening.
Promise me you'll come.
Take off your coat.
He runs to the station every morning.
They're running out of money.
Not here.
No one was satisfied.
I hope so.
I'm such an idiot.
I was trying to sleep.
Tom is always online.
I moved here from Boston.
Tom just texted me.
Tom's in this building somewhere.
We're open tomorrow.
I didn't expect this turn of events.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I asked him what his name was.
When do you want to leave?
There's got to be some logic.
Did you work yesterday?
How did you convince Tom to help us paint the slate?
Have you ever been to the capital of the United States, Washington?
Mary kept her balance.
I was just lucky.
They're very subjective.
It's a print.
I wonder if Tom is angry or not.
I have to prepare for the test.
The plane was flying east.
Don't let him touch this.

A baby's room.
Does this animal eat people?
Are you a vegetarian?
Do you want to live forever?
Listen to what I have to say.
He'll be here soon.
Can't you lift me up?
I'm not pregnant.
It didn't break.
I have a question.
That's all I had!
Tom said Mary must still be doing this.
I'm not sure I agree with him.
The boss let me go early today.
What time is the end of the world?
I never worry.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't owe him anything.
Where's your key?
It's going to be pretty cold tonight.
I'm not going to ask Tom for help.
How much did you pay to do that?
You don't have to stay.
One day we'll meet again.
You said you wouldn't do it.
It was a long flight.
Don't tell anyone.
I'm going to go.

Are these rumors true?
We really want that, don't we?
Finally, he dared to make her an offer.
Tom was not surprised at all that Mary spoke French so well.
I know you're here.
It's half past three.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
There is no great hope.
It's not mine.
What exactly do you want, Tom?
We're almost all of us.
Tom needs to be home by 2:30.
Do you walk to school?
Is this Tom's girlfriend?
Tom is just wasting his time.
A molecule is made up of atoms.
We're aware of that.
It's not a good time.
Will you have time to have lunch with me?
It's a shame he didn't come to the meeting.
Where do you live now?
You know, he's been through a rough patch recently.
Tom married a neighbor.
I have a headache.
Repeat again, please.
I'll be with you in a second.
I am learning English.
It's nice weather, isn't it?
Come if you can.
I hate that!
You're a little younger for me.
Tom is old for you.

Are you ready for the bad news?
I spoke to them.
Has Lucy called yet?
He looks like Tom.
You don't have to do this if you don't want to.
I was just about to wash.
It's delicious!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do this?
Mary wants me on her team.
No one listens anymore.
You are brave.
You have to do it yourself.
That means Tom was right.
I'll sit him there.
Put it down.
Tom came last.
The fiancees will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
You're really going to find them, aren't you?
I'm not good with moisture.
Are you sure Tom will come?
Where did you get that key?
Can I help you, ladies?

They love each other.
Come by tomorrow.
What insects did you eat?
I saw Tom get hit by a car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do it.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees that.
I got on the wrong bus.
I turned down that offer.
Mary has already done what she was supposed to do.
I was watching Tom.
Did you reserve a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
Like going on a picnic.
We couldn't buy tickets to the concert until we got money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
I am a Palestinian.
I can't do this alone.
Tom needs you here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in the area cannot experience the joy of living in the countryside.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a cake and a fries.
She stole the camera.
Please, to your new home!
I've got a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
Are you all right?
You may be the only one who can do that.
Who's wrong?
Your song makes professional singers red with shame.
You know Tom is lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom is going to be a bully.
He was great.
Tom knows that Mary didn't do this.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
I was bitten by a dog last week.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to blow it!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We are busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely that Tom will forget how to do it.
Are you drinking?
Will Tom do this with you?
Are you awake?
The meeting began at five o'clock on the day.
Mary said she likes doing that.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got a bill for electricity.
What color is his coat?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do that.
All members are required to attend.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm very lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who do you plan to do this with?
We are satisfied with the decision.
This asshole is cheap.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is this Mary's husband?
She'll find out.
A witness who has seen it with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard it.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom is done.
When I entered the room, she was playing the piano.
You are very kind.
Where are your manners?
They did not lose hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom straightened his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We should call the police.
Tom decided to go early.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
This is a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Okay, I'll have a taste.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I guess Tom won't be here today.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you are.
I wish you well.
Yes, I'd like to!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
That's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It's almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's get back to it.
Tom is not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning on staying long?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My kids are in school.
I put my suitcase in.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking of you.
I just did my job.
Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant forest.
Put salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't have lunch.
I'm not blaming anyone.
The plane took off at exactly nine.
Tom speaks French quite fluently.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom will dry out with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
This is a bracelet.
I have plenty of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Tom is leaving Boston next month.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss each other.
Millions of people die of hunger each year.
I wondered what Tom wanted.
The letter had the wrong address.
This is the last train.
Who's going to fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all in the chocolate.
They have changed their religion.
I should be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he up to?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just cut my hair.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I'm going to buy a new car.
We're the ones who are to blame.
You are so sweet.
It'll cost about fifteen dollars.
I knocked on the door.
His theory is worth considering.
We are ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
This is not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She's a tennis player.
That's how Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You were singing.
I did everything perfectly.
I love to write.
Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
I'm going to be 16 next month.
Do you think there's any chance that's going to happen?
Be at peace with your dreams.
What time is your last lesson?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What's wrong with her?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
We have to help Tom.
It was raining all day.
I was sad about it.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom is going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy the flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
You speak quietly.
The sun shines during the day and the moon at night.
I'm on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have a right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I'm having trouble with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom is probably being punished for what he did.
Mary is your girlfriend?
London has been hazy.
I'm so glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told Tom to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you will win.
She went to the airport to take him.
Get out of the way.
He's in the kitchen.
Please don't get mad.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly.
The capital of Brazil is Brasilia.
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay the phone bill.
Tom can cook.
But music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve a rest.
Here are the fresh ones.
Tom has huge eyes.
The cheer is seven colors.
I guess Tom shouldn't be doing this.
He's gray today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his honest opinion.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife doing, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has a lot of friends.
That would be unfair.
You or Jane should go there.
I'd ignore that if I were you.
Tom will be here just now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
You think I'm kidding?
I was very tired today.
I'm being honest.
Happiness does not come from having many things.
The news spread throughout Japan.
Tom showed the side of the mountain.
A taxi has arrived.
I heard him go down the stairs.
It's mine.
How strange!
Can you read Cyrillic?
I know Tom quite well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom is a jerk, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a silly asshole.
Did Tom pass you anything for me?
I would never have been able to do this without your help.
I always have coffee and jars for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't have breakfast.
I'm the best.
How did your exam go?
Can I pay later?
Did this just happen?
Mary didn't bring an umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
To tell you the truth, I lied.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did it.
They're all tourists.
Can I borrow a pincet?
It's your life.
Tom said he wanted to drink.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do it.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I was too embarrassed.
I've been digging into the details.

Let's go to the oceanarium.
Do you know what's causing the problem?
Where is Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry, she doesn't speak German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We're comfortable in our new home.
There are only two infinite things in the world, the universe and human stupidity.
She said, "I am very happy".
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
What you sow, you reap.
What are you up to?
Can we go faster?
We're not just football players.
All the meat was rotten.
I was born that way.
Tom and I ran races.
He came home late at night.
The UK's National Health Service has updated its coronavirus guidelines today.
Get your hat.
Tom and I drink the same thing.
He could not resist the urge to smoke another cigarette.
There's a secret passage.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's unconscious.
I thought Tom would refuse to do that.
I love you.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was a little freaked out.
He signed the check.
Hi, how are you?
The password is "Muiriel".
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Get the trash out.
You're my friend.
He has two cars.
They realized.
There's no problem with that!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!

Thank her for her help.

How did you learn French?
We already know you did it.
The claw is screwed.

Did you ask Tom?
Thank God, everyone was fine.
We're the perfect couple.
The faddle is too much of a mess.
Here's what you really need to do.
Tom is still in Boston.
Do you believe what Tom said?
I stopped drinking beer.
Tom says I'm a narrow-minded man.
I did that too.
What are you going to do tomorrow?
This is my wife Edith.
This student is American.

No one saw us.
I'll wait here.
As a young woman, she lived in the suburbs of Tokyo.

I can't delete the photos from the camera!
I was shocked to learn that I won.
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do this.
All dogs are animals. But that doesn't mean all animals are dogs.
Those who can think of only one way to spell a word obviously lack imagination.
I'm sure he will succeed.
Tom didn't do that.
Where is the nearest metro station?

It's part of the system.

It's Christmas today.
It's a barley ornament.
You said it was important.
Can you help me?
Tom said he hoped Mary could win.
I think they're students.
I just want to say that you did a good job.
I guess you've said enough.
I'm a client.
I'm very greedy.
You are crazy.
Tom won't bother Mary anymore.
Just answer me now.
I suspected that Tom missed home.
Tom hasn't done that since last year.
Are you done complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
Do they speak English?
No one saw Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I guess I know what Tom would do.

It's nice to meet you, Tom.
