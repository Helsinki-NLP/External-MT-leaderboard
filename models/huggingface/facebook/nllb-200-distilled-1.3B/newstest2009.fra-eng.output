The Prague stock market has fallen to negative after trading
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague stock market corrected its losses.
The transactions in ČEZ shares amounted to almost half of the usual daily trading volume.
On Tuesday, as soon as the market opened, the Prague stock market fell again from its previous day's fall of almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in stock prices on Wall Street.
The market reaction to the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilisation plan, is thus also felt here.
The fall in Asian stocks
Asian stock markets fell dramatically on Tuesday, although indices managed to wipe out some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four percent during trading, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the drop to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent as markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange was losing over five percent, but we finally managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the US bailout will affect financial markets around the world", observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should soon resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries could be affected.
The bloodbath of U.S. stocks
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected a financial system stimulus bill that would have cost up to $700 billion.
The lawmakers thus rejected President George Bush's call for support for the project.
According to Bush, the project should address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a bloodbath on Monday, and the major stock indexes fell to their lowest level in 20 years.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly seven percent, having last fallen this far in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it became clear that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress gave in: the US government can inject $700 billion into the banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the US financial system.
It will be put to a vote early next week.
The US legislature made a decisive shift in the talks on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the US financial system.
But success is not guaranteed.
Indeed, before the final version of the bill can be published and put to a vote, Congressmen must finalize a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
Sources say the plan should be put to a vote in the Senate by Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement of the rescue plan should be a major first psychological factor in reviving the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market support can be effective, there will be a 'disappointment'.
Paulson: The plan must work
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our differences about the form the market stabilisation package should take", said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government's structure.
The Commission should buy back from financial companies the unsellable real estate assets which cause financial undertakings considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to be pursued, but I think we are there", says Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has had a considerable impact on the falling stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the lawmakers are working to get Congress to reach a final deal by Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trading in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where the Congress' decision could affect trading on Monday.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of the US Congress will vote, or whether negotiations will be blocked at the last minute by one or another problem.
The legislators hope that it will be passed in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount of aid for the scheme must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not doing its job, it has the option of blocking the remaining amount in two steps: first an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr Bush welcomed progress in negotiations
While the president can veto this decision, Congress has the ability to make it a minority decision.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain financing for the purchase of bad real estate bonds, whose value plummeted because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Mr Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on the liability of the financial program, protection of taxpayers from losses, the deduction agreement, the timeline for the plan.
The new law also provides for a limit on the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and made significant progress toward an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides for assistance for property owners who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new installments for the mortgages it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of borrowers and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And this is because we don't know what the mechanism and the price of the buyback of distressed assets will be.
This will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government", says Marek this week on the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is adopted now or early next week is not so important, according to Marek.
"It is far more important that Congress agree this week to support this plan and to enact it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment", Marek stressed.
A fight that has gone to extremes: MP3 players versus mobile phones.
We'll advise you how to choose
While virtually every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Nevertheless, there are good reasons to get a freelance reader.
The choice depends entirely on the use and requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a high-end, expensive gramophone for the house to play the new album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Firstly, such music products are not released on vinyl, and from a quality standpoint there is no objective reason for this to happen.
If you have a shelf full of vinyl records of art rock, jazz, and blues, you probably dream of at least one such phonograph.
The same goes for music on the go, which is compressed music, to put it in a simplified way - MP3 music.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan would find it difficult to stand headphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, and there is enough room for everyone in between.
There's a lot to choose from.
Battery life is also crucial
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions that are, of course, unknown to most mobiles.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
In addition to basic functions, such as telephone calls and texting, it is capable of playing and recording music and films, has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if you factor in smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can roast meat and no television will take pictures, we are witnessing a miracle.
The universal nature of the mobile phone has its drawbacks.
The more functions you use, the shorter the interval between charging.
And reading music is one of the most important energy buffers.
Few mobiles are capable of playing music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the more basic ones) are much better.
In the case of cheap cell phones, expect them to play music for only a few hours.
If you also occasionally call, make sure you have a second charger for work - even for the most expensive devices.
This will not be a problem for MP3 players, which are capable of continuous operation for at least nine hours after being recharged, even if they are less efficient.
Another problem arises when recording music on the mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, you can record music directly onto the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without a charge, given the tiny size of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As far as the players are concerned, you do not need any software, except for the iPod.
All you have to do is fill the music player from the computer via the USB connector.
Most mobile devices and players will create a media library of their own, sorted by artist name, album title, style, or user judgment.
Some devices display only one index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, while others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles are more skilled
When choosing a particular device, you should be particularly interested in the battery life, memory capacity, sound quality and output type and, of course, ease of control.
If music is basically background noise to you and you're going to listen to it for a limited time during the day, like when you're on the tram, you just need any mobile phone that plays MP3s.
Almost any motive today is capable of doing this.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the player can play.
Everyone can play MP3s and the vast majority of music that will reach you will be in that format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play WMA music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the corresponding operator's (or another provider's) web pages from your mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical motive.
The supply of operators is unfortunately poor and is in most cases limited to quick-made radiotubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the Internet or even the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry their cell phone on them.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just take out your phone from your pocket, when you forgot your MP3 player at home.
It is also important if you always have earphones or a handsfree with a connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which almost all mobile phones have, but at least MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical instruments is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For the price of three thousand four thousand crowns, you can get a walkman that is already very convenient.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of an outlet for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best and best equipped telephones, with an entry for ordinary headphones, is not more than fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of being easy to control.
Anyone can order the most basic readers - which may not be the cheapest (see our choice).
Minimum functions; and the similarity of the control to that of a cassette recorder, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There's no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2 type, microSD, etc.).
Even if you include the additional cost of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand kroner.
But be careful.
The basic models generally only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones can even handle 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, get a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or a River.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman phones (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent MP3 control keys, and thus the ease of control is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman series phones have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, has gone the furthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
The first virtual operator will be launched in the Czech Republic this year.
- Maybe you did.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, we are still missing something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not be gone for long.
We have already mentioned many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ) reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
The latest steps taken by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges are likely to lead to a paradoxical situation - some Czech mobile operators will find SMS messages sent from abroad cheaper than domestically.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration rate well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the Chairman of the Board of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that there is no more room for another operator in the Czech Republic, joined the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network seems to have little luck (in fact, it would be difficult to find frequencies now).
There is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable fall in prices, to which conventional operators had to respond.
Yet even before the advent of such trouble makers as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices similar to those we hear at home today were heard in Britain.
However, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could be really successful.
We do not have to look too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator has managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission's proposal to set up a European network of telecommunications operators is not appropriate.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more specific target group.
For them to operate efficiently, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
This is how, globally, virtual operators are positioning themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS services at at least twice the price of its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, targeting an unusual target group can also be a good publicity stunt.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - a carrier they like and trust", says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual carrier.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would be likely to work here too.
The Commission notes that the Czech Republic has not yet adopted a comprehensive approach to the market for the provision of services to the telecommunications industry.
This is particularly so since it is relatively saturated in terms of service provision".
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
It seems almost certain, however, that if there is to be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our region", said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were not in favour of this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything they can to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera group, which is thus taking a new step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer sector, has made it clear for some time that it intends to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already held several negotiations with all Czech mobile operators on this possibility.
With some of them we have managed to make progress in the negotiations", says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
So the future may be bright.
From unofficial reports, it seems that we could perhaps welcome the first virtual operator as early as the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by complete silence.
'At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is very specific compared to others.
So far, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us", said Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefonika O2, in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally beneficial project that could serve as a basis".
It adds: 'It is virtually impossible that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network before the end of the year.
To operate in such a short time, we should have a concrete agreement now".
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
Miroslav Čepický says in this regard: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared fees and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for high-speed mobile internet.'
Responsible authorities: in step with operators
The approach of the mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would have led to lower prices and thus to a decrease in their profit.
What's the point of facilitating the rise of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators can get along like fair thieves, as is evident from the quarrel surrounding the creation of U:fon.
The greatest apparent pressure on ČTÚ, when U:fon was created, was exerted by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ's website.
Today, however, U:fon is being used as an argument against accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented on this: 'Competition on the mobile market has also recently been increased by the entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the RT mobile market, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would place high demands on it, especially on its services.'
But given the attitude of these mobile operators, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems puzzling.
This is not the only case of the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has no power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is the exclusive property of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
The latter, however, took his typical position on this issue.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer from potential interested parties has not been sufficiently attractive to conventional operators", said Kristián Chalupa from the ÚOHS's External Relations Department in response to our question.
A statement of this kind would not be surprising from the operators' representatives.
But such a statement from an agency which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than confusing.
Kristián Chalupa adds: "In other countries, where virtual operators are normally present, their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services".
However, it is not in the interest of ÚOHS to press for fair market operation and lower prices.
What is shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price for petrol which is strictly the same at all filling stations is probably due to chance and the fierce competition.
'The Office has not found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore no corresponding increased responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The telecommunications regulator probably lacks the tools to open up the mobile market to virtual operators", Chaloupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
There is of course an analysis of the relevant markets by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view: in order to create a virtual operator, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at all times.
And the mobile operator has a pretty logical monopoly on its network.
It is therefore necessary that it should play a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
Even without accepting this argument, it should at least be of concern to ÚOHS that three mobile operators are clearly acting in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the GTS Novera company, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Putting the blame on ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in communications, by which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the case.
We have seen this kind of attitude in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not extend the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this very well, but their interests seem to lie elsewhere.
When no one's looking, it can work.
However, the operation of a kind of virtual operators, several of which are on Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, these are companies involved in multi-level marketing.
Specialised mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms are usually only available to elected officials.
The trick is that the company is presented as a conventional business customer who orders a large quantity of SIM cards.
As a major customer, she gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are saying happens, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract that we would look into and could result in the termination of the cooperation with the company in question", Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such activity has not reached the heads of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such a procedure.
The activities of these firms bring them considerable profits and, at the same time, unlike genuine virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, but the services of these companies are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name and therefore they cannot have full control over it, as do ordinary mobile phone customers".
But that is precisely what should seem strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another question arises at the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators are turning a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively wide powers to disclose such activity, and that it will not be content with explanations from operators who claim to have no idea that this would happen, as their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable drop in the price of services.
In virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, however, the conventional operators made little or no effort to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - too small or too saturated a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But it is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies in developed countries have intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they eventually achieved the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities treat this issue like a hot potato that is disposed of by passing it to a nearby target.
In our experience we cannot escape the impression that confusion in skills is more than beneficial in these cases.
But let's not throw the sleeve after the axe.
If the behind-the-scenes news is true and a virtual operator soon appears in our country, the Czech mobile market may be back on track.
If one operator has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly be able to remain unmoved by the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech national anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech Citizenship, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singer, a chorus and an instrumental version.
The vocals are provided by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the composers of the arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the server iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the solo performances singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both singers and the choir had a good diction, so that the words were understood, that they sang simultaneously", he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stages of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (The Saviors' Kermesse), an original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, with music by František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously took it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Prague's public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip in its ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency) located at Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
From yesterday, it is also possible to buy coupons online on the Dopravní podnik's website: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people enjoyed the morning service.
Those who start using the online shop can forget about the ticket counters in the metro stations, where they have so far had to eagerly step in long lines to get paper tickets.
They will buy their voucher online and it will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these contact points, passengers have a ticket office with trained staff, who will help them with their online purchases and also save the voucher they have purchased on their card", says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic vouchers on the Opencard in ATMs in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, reminds one of the ticket compositing machines, and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty", Opatrný added.
An automaton will control the coupon for the driver
The machines that will be operational from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will automatically register on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
The main use of the buses is for the suburban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"On trains integrated into Pražská integrovaná doprava (Prague integrated transport), controllers are equipped with card readers, which they use to establish the temporary and zonal validity of the tickets", said ticket controller Filip Drápal of Ropid, which designs Prague public transport timetables.
Suburban buses are equipped with card readers integrated in the driver's cab.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smartcard to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the indicated place on the side of the trunk.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and do not remember the expiry date of their voucher can re-join the ATMs, which were originally used to save the vouchers on the card.
This is where the information on the validity of their document will be displayed on the screen.
Sudetenlanders were calling for a referendum in the US
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that Šumava be incorporated into the United States.
This is shown by a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the president of the United States with such a desire.
This is evidenced, among other things, by a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
In the letter, Germans from Český Krumlov asked the US president not to allow the "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have a clear understanding of the situation and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are coming to German territory are not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", the letter, signed "Persons who care about the fate of the Šumava", reads.
Since the alleged promise of joining Czechoslovakia - given the Czech national character - is nothing but brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the letter's authors urge the US president to take the Šumava protectorate into his own hands now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has done nothing to help the Allies win without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants", the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president doubted the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, he would have to organise, according to the letter's authors, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the US or live under US patronage.
Although the text in the letter may seem somewhat naive, given current knowledge of postwar history, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the time.
While the Czech Germans must have at least foreseen the possibility of expulsion from the republic, very few of them considered such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to give the Sudetenland some kind of autonomy.
Others thought they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German from České Budějovice, enlisted in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in a concentration camp in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to him to learn Czech.
"They thought that when they returned home, the Czech language would be useful to them", says Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war thought that the Beneš Decrees would expel them from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
A campaign to attack drivers
The most expensive road safety measure in Czech history.
A way of characterizing the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving.
This 150 million dollar campaign will be shown on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, and on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from speeding and drinking while driving.
But also remind them to fasten their seat belts before they start.
It is intended to reach the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and professional drivers.
What's going to be in the commercials?
Especially personal stories that will attack the emotions.
This is also reflected in the campaign's "bloody" slogan:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay".
Which must symbolize that one can pay with one's life for a moment of inattention.
The commercials will haunt viewers until 2010.
The ministry has taken inspiration from similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with harsh images of accident victims are common.
He believes this will lead to a reduction in the number of accidents and fatalities on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whipping against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when they roast a red light.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risks", says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is why we need information campaigns in the press, and especially negative advertising, says the psychologist.
He said that the warning signs to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static warning sign is installed, it will probably quickly blend in with the environment and drivers will not notice it", Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the chairman of the Israeli provisional government, spoke in favour of returning virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all", Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without that, there will be no peace", he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially not to be trampled underfoot by tractors and bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem", Olmert said, referring to the two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical sites" located inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work", he later stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he considered an indispensable condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat", he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to abandon their constant support for the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda (terrorist network), as well as Jihad (holy war) in Iraq", the Prime Minister said.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are flight attendants on the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance bus is forbidden
In the wake of the tragic bus accident at the Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers can travel inside the bus during the journey.
"If we want strict and formal compliance with the law, the activity of a steward is against the road traffic law", says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident in question, in which a 22-year-old flight attendant died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus.
The girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats available.
But the bus can crash or even brake abruptly, even while the steward is serving coffee or distributing newspapers.
The important thing is whether the coach is equipped with standing seats or not.
If this equipment for standing passengers is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have standing places, as confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by the company's director Radim Jančura.
"This is a matter we have discussed with the ministry and at first it forbids all travel of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got the passengers to go to the toilet during the journey as long as they have their own seat", he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the steward's role - no legal prescription deals with this role.
Furthermore, there is no legal requirement to prohibit the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only defines the term 'vehicle receiver'; it does not define the rights and duties of the receiver", adds spokesman Hanzelka with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the head of the Road Traffic Department, believes that the law deals with the problem sufficiently.
"It all depends on whether the bus has standing passenger seating permits in its approval.
It's all in there", he said.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, long-distance with standing places and a higher allowed speed and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest allowed maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like flying, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert on transport safety at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety), does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"There is no danger in regular traffic, and the situation is comparable to that of airline service.
Here too, it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the flight attendant may hit her head".
"But if the bus had brake abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously apply.
Just like in a city bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by internal regulations", he says, adding that the problem is not solved from a legal point of view.
Jančura is ready to eliminate these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer steward services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after the accident, the manager doesn't consider their job a risky one.
"However, as soon as I feel that this is a risky occupation, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
It would also reduce costs", he says.
The reason given for the absence of stewards in the car is safety concerns by Asiana's manager Alexei Litvine, who has a very small number of lines compared to SA.
"We have no hostesses, we have been against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz a year ago.
A great tragedy has come
A young flight attendant from the Plzeň area, who had worked for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop lane without using a flashing light and blocked the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid him by means of a sudden maneuver, but he almost ran over him on his right side.
Jančura denies that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest have been sold.
'In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked.'
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's decision, but for the financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being worked on for over a year by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the travel of stewards on board the bus.
"But it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not so much interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers", concludes spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the police and the Office for Safety at Work are responsible for the safety of buses.
The hopes of the Dusseldorfer are now in Frankfurt.
The letter from the WestLB Management Committee to the employees of the company was full of bold words.
The merger of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could create the "central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group", according to the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would provide a 'competence block' doubled by sustainable productivity in such a case.
In the end, such a relationship could be the decisive catalyst for further mergers in the banking sector in the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a board of directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, which is hurting, is still under a lot of pressure.
It is not only the European Commission but also the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made it clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - of some kind of relationship between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's customers from their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank, Franz Waas, said at the presentation of the six-month figures at the end of August that he saw no point in merging the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, be it Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, which is half-supported by the banks of the Länder and the savings banks' groupings, has instructed the Management Committee to conduct negotiations with WestLB with a view to joint commercial activities.
It could then be the outflow from the financial market, or parts of it.
The negotiations have only just begun, however, as the financial world says.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which employs 3000 people and is one of the largest employers in Frankfurt, has been involved in consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Rhineland-Palatinate Bank and Halbab.
But nothing came of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had hardly been made public when the government of the Land of Hesse spoke out against any participation by Hellaba in them.
After that, the other two houses did not join either.
The Land Rhineland-Palatinate Bank was instead linked to the Land Bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there were always new negotiations on the merger of Deka-Bank with banks in the Länder.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Management Committee, was against any business strategy of merging with his bank.
In addition, there seems to be a widespread feeling that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Land of Bavaria has passed, a merger of BayernLB with the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg could be the first step.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure to merge should increase, the potential partners will gradually escape.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far withstood the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia group of savings and credit institutions, which owns 85% of Helaba's capital, however, closed all mergers with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
NordLB would remain in the strictest sense.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, reflect only one facet.
Another aspect is how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched.
In June Merl stated that the decisive question, which business model should ensure the future capacity of the banks in the Länder, had not been solved by the German group of savings and credit transfers.
In the long term, a splitting of the WestLB could take place, which is obviously not desirable here.
This is also what is mentioned in the letter from the existing management committee: in any case, a 'global solution' for the institution would be sought.
How all this will be put into the same basket with the merger of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca, it's the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena's with him as his girlfriend, so nothing's the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-liter keg of Kaiser beer, stands a well-built bearded man who shows the 200 or so visitors to the beer festival the deep sounds his throat can make.
Elena slaps Luca first, then she kisses him.
They came all the way from Bologna to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta Nueva station, four buses will leave tonight at 11:45 pm, arriving at 6:30 am.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, one bus is exclusively for Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing golden and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And noisy, Marco Guarda explains, is not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat with a false fur coat and silver-rimmed glasses.
They've been going to the beer festival for five years, three firings this year alone.
They go in at night, stay at the party all day, and come back at 10:30.
Marco explains that spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed according to the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a manager of the German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses are running at night on the Autostrada in the direction of Brennero.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon, everything becomes quiet in the bus, the passengers fall asleep.
It's better this way, they'll still need their strength.
There will be stops at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, while a number of other buses with Italian plates will stop again just before Munich on motorway 8.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Place Thérèse at 6:30 a.m. in the early morning, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First: wear the little yellow hat.
On the left side of the card is written ≪beer party, in Gothic, and next to it is the website of Marco's travel agency ≫conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the beer hall open, you run,' cries Marco in the early morning.
Run and reserve seats in the back of the tent.
`Not in front, or we'll block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, we have to distribute them around the room!'
The top, Marco shouts, costs $8.25.
And remember the instructions!
`Show the security guards that we're behaving ourselves!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `Tonight, be back here at half past ten!' Understood?
And there it is, it's headed for the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow hats to trees to find the way, to signs and even to a poster of a popular Bavarian party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It's the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the `weekend of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who set out across the Alps and collapsed in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors are said to have come deliberately from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles statistics on countries where Italians are in first place behind the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that Italians especially like is the Hofbräu brewery tent.
Sleepless nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
How fortunate that the politician used the word "relatively" and that he was hinting that the German banking sector would not be spared the movements of crisis.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed on the DAX, obtained a 1 billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are being issued for up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction it would be entitled to.
The money comes from private banks as well as public banks.
In the background, it is the Depfa subsidiary that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible because of distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had been reduced by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and the equity ratio had also weakened slightly from 1,6% to 1,45%.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were down by zero points compared with the same period last year, while profits from the allocation of loans and securities and the provisioning of credit operations fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the substantial profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the tax procedure book and commercial purchases for Konzern companies, did the profit gap of around 16 per cent prove to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially mis-speculated on industrial real estate loans, which were subsequently branched off to Aareal bank.
Because traditional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private and public investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate has to make depreciation which should have a material and substantial effect on the group's profit and loss calculation, but which remains rather vague.
The fact is, the dividends have been cut.
Already in 2007, they had been cut to two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a very important state and infrastructure investor since the purchase of Depfa.
It is more robust than other institutions that rely on interbank refinancing because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has again dried up considerably as banks have accumulated liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term refinancing facility for a part of the Depfa's total loans - about EUR 50 billion - each year.
According to a press release from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of the largely non-operating international financial markets.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE's Chairman of the Board of Directors Georg Funke, on the other hand, explained that Hypo Real Estate should no longer have to use the financial markets in the medium term.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BAFIN) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Group is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank can only hope.
However, given the dynamics and the immensity of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that the whole of the financing should not be used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
The Bank is still on the verge of insolvency, according to the latest reports, late Sunday evening, so this at least temporary rescue will not be a satisfactory one either.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are performing particularly well.
While the principal debts have barely moved, the prices of the secondary loans are falling.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and those that have a life span beyond 2009.
The bonds of Hypo Real Estate Bank previously appeared to be an alternative speculative investment, but their value must now be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the sharp worsening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which brought the crisis into the institution by buying Depfa Bank.
As long as the less affected issuers, governments and commercial banks are still willing to support the system, it can be assumed that the arrears will be paid off over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But with the renewed rumors of partial nationalisation, the likelihood that was approaching certainty has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should save sleepless nights for long-term creditors in deciding whether to part with their liabilities.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn to carry forward losses for the next few years on the next capital gains tax automatically levied on stock market gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento club
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to report for her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: German is so kawaii!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the manga - in her new Log of Exchanges, she talks about Japan.
"First day of school in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was already scared on the way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, heading to Kawasaki, and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, but luckily I didn't get lost.
The start of school seems not to be as strictly fixed as in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine minutes past twenty, a round of tables begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
I had not yet worn my school uniform, so I put on an old skirt from my foster mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks, and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I went to the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all said silent mass, laughed and waved, and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew him from my manga.
It is a key word in the Japanese teenager's vocabulary and means "cute, cute".
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled at me, and she thought it was an honor that the correspondent should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, I was assaulted in the period.
Everyone was talking to each other, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My foster mother also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really different from the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some meat with tofu on it.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look weird and taste completely new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salty prunes candy, brrrr!
Bentos aren't just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read that in my manga.
I wonder if I could watch it here, too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year in school in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
After all, reading manga has been my favorite thing for years.
And in order to better understand manga and the culture that is there, at some point, I also started learning Japanese.
It was very clear to me that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen".
Rats have feelings too
If a rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean it feels fear too?
Neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have sensations too.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by renowned scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without proof?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or anyone else has not been able to prove so far just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and we address issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter into terrain that is difficult to work because the hardware doesn't match.
When faced with danger, a rat does what many other animals do: it kills, runs away, or attacks.
Humans behave in a similar way, which is why some scientists infer a similar subjective experience.
However, I do not believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to translate our subjective experience into that of animals.
One aspect is that circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its involvement in short-term memory and in executive and directory functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other creatures.
So at least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including our awareness of who we are, and our ability to predict and decide, it's reasonable to assume that humans are even different from other primates.
Another significant feature may lie in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being linked to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In that case, we could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness were not to be dependent on language, it would certainly be influenced by it, so that animal consciousness, however it is produced, would probably be very different from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what the conscience may look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, cannot be measured or, because of this particular hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses us big problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
You could look at the processes of consciousness in animals without considering the content, and that's exactly what happened in studies of short-term memory in primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which was developed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the neural correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex in visualization.
But what does that do for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system like fear is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is the state of mind we find ourselves in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its effects, such as body reactions) takes over the vivid memory.
So, emotion is closely linked to the areas of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our fickle nature, are revealed, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute to others than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities originate in the cortex and brainstem regions of body sensation, as does Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much over the course of human evolution, it could very well participate in all sorts of transverse sensations.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in humans and rats is probably felt as fear in both cases: how could one test whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in similar ways?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if it's afraid?
I don't think similar behavior is enough to prove identical experiences.
The nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brainstems, but cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the source of sensations?
And even if we could prove this in humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is a significant improvement in the nervous system, as the same measurements are made in rats and humans.
Since I'm not exploring language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You might think of it as a short-term challenge, but I'd rather move on than constantly bang myself against a wall.
I am indeed an emotional pragmatist.
Platini, UEFA president: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise European Championships in cooperation with Poland", Wasjunik said.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to be done in both countries".
In the timetable of building or demolishing stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are running out of time.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed", said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA is watching us constantly".
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act within the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have written to the UEFA president assuring him that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not be affected".
Several members of the Premier League were already convicted of relegation-management in the previous season; in the end, the start of the league had to be postponed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid outraged by counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, opened up about her personal life in an interview - and now she's in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has revealed her adulterous ex Dennis Quaid.
He foams - and counterattacks.
A late Rose War for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - in full view of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful".
She would have learned the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this thought-stripping is Ryan's press for his new film "The Women" - it's about an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to being called an unfaithful husband was clear: "It would be monstrous", the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, "if Meg re-wrote and manipulated our relationship story again".
It would be even more "regrettable" if "the pain and upheaval of divorce for each child were to be re-lived in public" for their common 16-year-old son Jack".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon be the father of twins.
This was his response to the claw: "Anyway, my life goes on.
I feel blessed to have a wonderful family that is doing well".
Airline tickets and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, a recent study even said that theft would be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel stays would be profitable again - according to a study by travel and financial services company American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, hotel stays have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 per cent compared with 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was particularly pronounced in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express attributes the reason for this to the low dollar value that has led to a "declining desire to travel among American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are holding steady with a 26.3 percent increase, the highest in Europe.
The trend in flight prices was also upward in the first quarter:
The price of fuel increased, and passengers in economy class paid an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while long-haul flights, which use a lot of fuel, increased by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy class ticket prices fell on average by 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but price changes were far less pronounced in business and first class.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell 23.6 percent.
The German domestic flights were even halved according to this study.
The reason for the fall in prices is, the firm says, a slowdown in economic growth.
Demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure from competition from the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Belgian authorities on the measures taken by the Belgian authorities to implement the restructuring plan.
HSV beat Gladbach by 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg becomes first in the standings.
In Borussia, Luhukay still hasn't managed to find a working eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein, enlarge, crash landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only came back late in the game and his shot missed the goal frame.
His message was precise, his words persuasive.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal", whistled Hermann Rieger in the locker room of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the locker room, halftime was over and most of the players were sitting down.
Rieger has been the HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, enjoying a high reputation like many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and nodded in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with that second goal!
The implementation was lacking.
"Everything was not very nice to see today", later confessed Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard "would like to be more relaxed too".
The 1-0 (1:0 at half-time) result was due to a successful header by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players from Gladbach could not hurt the weak players from Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory", Marin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121st birthday on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to step back", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the mid-table result reflects the unpredictability of the Premier League rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late entrants - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as FC Bayern's debaucher Jansen - is slowly forming, but it is not yet shining.
"We need more charm and more dribbling", Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the bailout plan caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a single day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little.
At about 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index was trading at 10,579 points, down by a whopping five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock market index was at 1,548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The biggest losers on the Dow Jones were American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No stock could make a profit.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs Bank fell by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds must be mobilised to buy so-called bad mortgage securities.
The amount must, however, be paid gradually, not all at once.
In return, the State should recover options on the financial company's shares which can be traded in correlation to price movements in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
The stock prices sucked in in the swirl in Europe and the USA
Billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not alleviate investors' concerns.
The stock price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is falling despite the government's financial bailout.
The sharp declines in prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led to a deep deficit in the German index (Dax).
The Bavarian real estate financier's shares have lost three-quarters of their value for the moment despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank said, a drop of more than 20 percent.
The Dax has slipped well below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and stands at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 per cent.
Around the world, the stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a big loss.
Investors were concerned that the US government's massive $700 billion bailout plan might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points fell 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of trading.
The U.S. House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on the bailout plan, with the Senate vote expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 per cent for the time being, while the CAC 40 in Paris fell by 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after rising 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index plunged 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main index Sensex dropped 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The multinational business and tourism group has also indicated that it will not sell its shares to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter is affecting the flight of space probes
For years, researchers have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon - dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational pull maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of the soon-to-be-frozen fuel lines, she's at risk of cryogenic death.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled scientists - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravity support is a maneuver by which spacecraft gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This has puzzled researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent the way we would expect according to the venerable laws of gravity.
In addition, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes suddenly get faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They called it the gravitational support anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was right and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support by using what is called the dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also found near the Earth", he writes.
Space scientists have known about the existence of dark matter for only about a decade.
It apparently emits an attractive force that can be observed in other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, that is, it neither emits nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists calculate that dark matter would still make up a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt freed
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt are expected to be released, as the Italian Foreign Ministry confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations would already be underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE presents the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara appear to be free.
This was reported jointly by the Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabija television channel and the Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after news reports on the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health", Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and the Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are safe and well, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants in the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: the kidnappers were close to stopping the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security official, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without a fight.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", the officer said.
All that was left was to collect the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany, which was to be paid by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported that a German mediator said the hostages were being held for a long time because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the story.
Abuse by a Stepfather ' Led to Suicide '
A court was informed that years of abuse by her stepfather had led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court found that he regularly bound his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, when she was between 5 and 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court has been informed that Ms Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
As a child living in Coventry, Trerise had bound and gagged her before forcing her into sexual acts while her mother worked in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he moved back to Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Miss Randle, a diligent National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told him that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had since 2006 appeared "emotionally dead", and "lost all hope of life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by choking on a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather who had, incidentally, written a confession letter that ended: "I tied and bandaged her regularly".
"I did not sexually abuse her.
"I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrified, especially at age seven.
"This unpleasant saga ended in the suicide of the victim.
And what is even more amazing is the fact that if she had not done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court".
He added: "I particularly emphasize, as her father and mother describe, the effects of your crime committed over the years on Stephanie.
"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, successful young woman today".
Conviction for loss of official records.
The Cabinet Office official who forgot top secret documents on a train in June will be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The defence ministry man was on a trip when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train bound for Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any hint of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the episode had many people in Whitehall.
"They would have thought this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office", he said.
The employee who cannot be named is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause that deals with the safekeeping of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the departmental officer be placed under the custody of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then taken from his home to a secret location.
Building societies in front of the B&B bill.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of over £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
The executive director of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "irritating" that the companies and their members would have to pay the price...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford and Bingleys' mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will rise at the same time will be charged to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits every year.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that all 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions that have been prudent... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a sum proportionate to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will be £450m in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, chief executive of the building companies' trade committee, told the BBC that he felt the decision was unfair.
It is "irritating" that institutions that behaved prudently when the housing market recovered now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, when the first records were made.
"We need to look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks, to evaluate options to avoid building societies and their members paying this hefty bill", said Mr Cole.
The interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest for the entire year will have to be paid, which could even double.
Since building societies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk goes up to five pence a litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by five pence a liter, effective Monday.
This is the second price increase after a twopenny increase in February, and follows research by a consultancy firm.
Retailers have to decide if they're going to turn up the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last varied in 2002.
Former Bangladesh PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is at risk of being arrested upon her return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because she was being tried for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,000) from a businessman when she was PM.
This case is one of many that have been brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but her Awani League party has demanded that the country's interim military government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she cannot remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's application saying she does not need bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal the Supreme Court's order"
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami Party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June to seek medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denies the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children missed the recent polio vaccination campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
The UN last week carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she has not been able to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV court battle
BSkyB lost its case following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would have required it to reduce its stake in its rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17,9% to less than 7,5%.
The Commission stated that MSkyB's participation had in the past prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement which was in effect intended to prevent NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV shares had cast doubt on ITV's actual independence, leading the Competition Commission to investigate the
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB countered that forcing it to reduce its shares in ITV would not be reasonable and was on the contrary excessive  especially since BSkyB had just relinquished its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorney's case.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The whole thing started with the report of the Justice Department's inspector general, who criticized the actions of some government officials.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who claim that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Serious, potentially criminal, unsubstantiated allegations of conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved", said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor who could force witnesses to testify was one of his biggest recommendations.
The dispute began with the dismissal in December 2006 of nine U.S. attorneys by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said prosecutors were fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that fired prosecutors were not more criticized than their colleagues, leading some observers to attribute these firings to political overtones.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to congressional Republicans, while others reportedly refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but not for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was eventually accused of being involved in this firing case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of government officials in the Justice Department have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was highly critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these layoffs, and ended up "abdicating" his leadership role, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other department officials, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, were critical of his failure to cooperate during the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic will have to be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honoured" to receive the recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
The awards night is hosted by Coldplay, with this year's shortlist being four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly makes it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like Meat Loaf's.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, peaking at number fifteen.
In addition, her album Bat Out of Hell spent nine years in the UK charts, and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - or Marvin Lee Aday, as he's known - has been plagued by health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to repair his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, severe laryngitis forced her to cancel concerts.
Then they found a cyst in her vocal cords.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be for sale.
New York City has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets, and other side streets, some famous, others merely functional.
And even some veteran cab drivers and longtime local residents can't give directions to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - not to be confused with Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide by 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active artery.
There are no signs to the street.
It's virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers, though.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaint Extra Place, and create a more seamless passage to the shops and boutiques, which are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other fans, including longtime neighbors, have said they are charmed by the shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the city's Department of Conservation and Housing Development, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood owners' committees, city agency and Avalon Bay representatives drafted a proposal allowing the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few city-owned spaces left, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place", she said.
"They could offer to fix it and run it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public".
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repaint the small street and install seating, some of which would be used by a cafe to which the builder would grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, it doesn't necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to re-look at this abandoned alley, and make it public", she said, noting that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Property Preservation, confirmed that the city was willing to sell the street, adding that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been so named since 1802, when the inheritance of the large farmhouse of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The back entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful", said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes".
Some residents, including bloggers who had previously spoken about the East Village's move to luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place a real rarity - a virtually identical fragment of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, and bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and shutters, full of last week's newspapers flying down the gutters".
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A rat is running agile down the alley near a door that used to lead to the CBGB, now the headquarters of a high-end clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, lying next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested it be promoted.
Mr Field, for his part, said he thought that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were spent in dark, damp, disgusting places".
The bilingual debate: immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Oversight program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former fellow at the California Studies Institute and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think.
Getting the favor of the Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's education proposals are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign is pointing out that "African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students".
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program, among many other things, particularly supports "bilingual transitional education" for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire for bilingual education that advocates teaching in classrooms in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic, low-income.
Over a third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, study English.
Among the students of the 1st grade, 100% passed the 2008 State Mathematics Exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English Language Arts exam.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to a different ingredient than the one put forward by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street is based on analysis, practice, constant assessment of capabilities and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, the school introduced "full immersion" English language instruction.
Total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in education.
Ms. Mikels, opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without her class, you would have no chance of identifying her".
"It works", she observes, "it worked for us".
Shouldn't Mr. Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools made up of mostly Hispanic students learning English?
The school's excellent results speak for themselves; but the education policies within his party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and his overwhelming support for bilingual education cloud Mr. Obama's prognosis of response.
While he is in favor of immigrants learning English, Mr. Obama recently dismissed this issue as irrelevant when he proclaimed that we all need to stop arguing about the wording of laws in English.
Instead, he said, "You have to make sure your child speaks Spanish".
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than dismissing or dismissing them as insignificant.
The oil market is falling sharply as a result of new concerns in the world economy.
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people feared that the bailout plan to boost financial markets would not revive the economy.
Crude oil futures have fallen 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel, the New York Stock Exchange said in a sell-off this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, the commodities markets have been rocked by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After rising to $145.29 a barrel in July, prices have fallen to almost $90 a barrel this month before rebounding again amid deep uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors are once again worried despite the largest bailout ever agreed to by congressional leaders this weekend.
The news has been tempered by recent concerns that the crisis will be long-lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic talks this weekend, concluded with the bailout deal "seem to have failed to revive the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
"the outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange markets has become uncertain", Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to investors.
"we believe that raw materials will not escape this contagion.
"As for raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the US virus will spread globally and particularly in China".
The bank's analysts have cut their forecasts for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, and were therefore forced to cut their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20percent.
The second half party is crucial to improving the team's record.
After spending the last eight seasons, longer than anyone in a Jets uniform, Shaun Ellis, the defensive back thought he'd seen it all.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like it", Ellis said.
The second half started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played dirty under a cloud.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to pass to Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, the precursor to an afternoon in which their relationship took a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a cornerback fell and the second, 10 seconds into the half.
"I'm not out of my zone" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player"
"We had a very good communication, despite what people thought".
While Favre and Coles were wrestling, the defense was beating Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, cornerback, intercepted a missed shot and ran 32 yards for the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball slip because of Warner.
The last change, losing the Bowens ball, might be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of that possession for the final 10 seconds, and then the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely made a 20-yard field goal to take a 34-0 lead.
That was the best the Jets have scored in a while.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said, "Second half or third?"
When told both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third half - Mangini said, "I can tell you I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
." Many points were scored in a short time".
Gebrselassie is resting, beating his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, from Ethiopia, once again proved himself worthy of the title of best long distance runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 win in a comfortable race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 set last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie has broken the 26th world record in his amazing career, during which he won the world championship or world record for any distance, the 1600m marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympics marathon, perhaps overstating the point, fearing that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near perfect conditions - sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday, keeping an impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans who converted to long distance running, have contributed to the decline of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last decade, since 1998, when Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier, and missed training for a week.
Clearly, resting helped it stay bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy", he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I tried again last week, and today I was having doubts; but in the end, everything worked out for the best.'"
He has been criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding the world's marathon stars, actually relying on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a long-distance runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, ahead of four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04 at half-way.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the heads of the line disappeared.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made his final climb to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by five minutes.
Kamathis finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a Kazakh-born now German citizen, finished a remarkable year with a seventh-place time of 2:19:19.
The Englishwoman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was unable to compete in the Beijing Games due to a hypothetical back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on her third marathon personal best by almost five minutes.
She ran using a clever strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a nice lead, then overtaking them about 18 1⁄2 miles later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and the trials of black life
Hidden in the development of its vast park, a few miles from the sunny, glittering, giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, first all-black town to be incorporated, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, that description she made in 1935 is not so simple to make nowadays. "The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no jail".
It has now become a pilgrimage town
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in many ways, the city she describes -- which became a tourist destination thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guidebook published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project -- remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, doesn't know what he's missing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has called for an open dialogue on race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how we tell the story", said Hortense Jones, 59, a longtime resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historic model of a black takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of rural Southern black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes hailed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt, dialect-filled books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guidebook transformed this town, located just off of Highway 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida, often forgotten, and that ends in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a big box in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"On the left", she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and those well-kept playgrounds that Howard Miller has always cared for, although he can barely read and write.
She further mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve passersby.
So in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora described the reality well", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: "Some people didn't like it".
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town unannounced in a large Chevy, cigarette in his mouth and pants on, where even today, people are proud of traditional clothing.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
"people were always happy to see Zora", he said.
But he adds, swinging in his back-patio chair overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was likely baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some sort of grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she lived.
In Eatonville, there's no big memorial service, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered the world", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane freeway in the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's main two-lane street.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has ended the community's relatively idyllic isolation.
In the 1950s, the race rift led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"at that time a bunch of white youths would come and throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side", said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady even died".
They threw a watermelon out of their car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, calling its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember - we kissed our teacher in the morning, and in the evening too", said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief executive of the Eatonville Community Guard, a nonprofit group.
This went on, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural line here", said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, by the way, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, like her, armed with a joyful self-confidence and guidelines such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
I can't believe this".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's unmarked grave and began a struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a best-seller, reintroduced her to the American cannon.
The highway project came just as Eatonville's most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors see her as a savior.
The community began holding a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride", said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed it up by saying that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Nonresidents, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been a member of our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic town since 1998.
A single-theme library (of course named Hurston) opened in 2006 on a beautiful, re-paved Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back alley on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(now 90 percent black)
Foreigners who come to learn about Eatonville's history, its purpose, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields - you can't take pictures of.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher with a soft spot for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be misunderstood.
However, as the Hurston Festival expanded, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular tend to view Eatonville as Hurston viewed his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and mixed as any other ethnic and racial group in America.
How much sincere civic affection can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work for the local government or the police force, which needs reinforcements.
And even for the youngest, like 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon, they seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who pass through this area will think: 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to others,'" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take time to look at the history, it's a very beautiful city".
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
But still, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the eye of the storm.
They could never imagine that in the glass offices and beehives above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise New York are having the worst "work day in the office" since the 1929 crash.
Delivery men continue to creep along the sidewalks with their trolleys and muffin trays for the afternoon meetings.
Latinos still hang around the apartment buildings carrying, like mules, about 50 fancy shirts hanging from a yoke on their shoulders.
Office workers continue to stand in line to buy their sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I hadn't felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to go and open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, for I found that at my local J.P. Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were waiting in line.
Not at the cash registers, not to withdraw cash or make a deposit, but at the customer service counter, where regular customers would order their checkbooks, tourists would ask for directions to Macy's, and new customers would open accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "permanent banker", were all in line for the same reason I was.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called thrifts (like a building society), credit unions, and the kind of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and that say they treat customers like family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 bank, has filed for bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank they thought was reliable, the one that's the biggest bailout on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become quite familiar with the financial world in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its meager CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she would have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor at my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable store.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances".
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria swings to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They wear road signs with red-striped mosques.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria over the weekend of the country's far-right political parties' victory in the general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, in an organized action.
The criminals painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several graves, but detectives believe this may have been done to mask the extremists' hatred of Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow related to the election?
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said it was "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which comes just as the religious month of Ramadan draws to a close.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage after swinging to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, waged an anti-immigration campaign, some of whose slogans were even considered, according to critics, xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won over 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the wearing of headscarves and burqas, and even expressed opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties try to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted just after the elections have defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, as demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made a difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, from expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he told the authorities who were holding him that he intended to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police issued the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter guilty of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at the Ashford limited jurisdiction courts, but was nonetheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Court, Kent Police applied for an application to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present at the time".
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, despite being on the list of sexual abuse suspects.
If you wish to travel abroad for more than three days, you must inform the authorities.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
If he doesn't report his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss specific cases or Glitter's potential travel within the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those abroad.
"We think it's easier to monitor someone staying in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
"protecting the people of Kent is the highest priority for Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, to minimise any potential risk to the public".
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls, aged 10 and 11 respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him at passport control, and he eventually left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and he was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport's Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the limited jurisdiction court in Uxbridge, West London, to register him on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
Glitter had previously served a four-month sentence in the UK for possessing child abuse images.
A Home Office source said Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary, was reassured and happy to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes of the woods.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, free from all tension to achieve the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On one side, the artist.
The other person.
Inseparable except in the privacy of those moments unknown to the general public, when you discover by intimate gestures and stolen gazes artists who don't mind getting on stage.
German artist Günther Bauer mixes the theatricality of a few performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of the artists in "Flamenco - people".
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programme of Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, which grows every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of performers on stage.
These people photographed "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy on stage ... captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have their own personalities and character.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera moments of the personality of the flamenco stars".
With the Festival "Song populaire des mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, are reminiscent of classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the dance or the singing itself, but the personality and character of the performer that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and the magic has been the constant of this work that is being presented these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has evolved into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, get to know them and be able to enter their lives for a moment or longer.
I think in photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You're standing in front of people, characters that you sometimes don't know or that you only have a few minutes to take a picture of.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
This collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at 20 Rue de la Mata (parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule) and will be open until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he is writing is "very bold"
The novel is set in places no one knows and deals with unknown topics, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to move forward with the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and who has traveled through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner for literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that the novel he is currently working on "is a real audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I will and I hope to finish it", he concluded in his speech at the four-day festival of ideas and thoughts that saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people parade through the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the votes cast, filled the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The Festival's presenter, Felix Romeo, found himself facing a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical way" through intense documentation work, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure amusement, a fleeting experience", said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike" because writers are told "not to be carried away by frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather ruins the Pozoblanco fair
The flag-raising that concluded the Pozoblanco bullfighting fair was called off yesterday morning after the bull riders checked that the arena was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The bad weather was a major factor in the failure of the fair, as two out of every three events were cancelled.
On Saturday, it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bullfight.
On the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have competed in the Castilblanco arena
So only the Friday party took place
Friday's winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded from two flags planted on the bull's back and a severed ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight with the bull itself.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arena of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was booed by most of the audience.
Police check of van in Alava province: 2,000 kg of hashish found
It's five to ten in the morning.
Traffic control by the Euskadi Police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
The police arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two attempt to flee.
His shipment, over two tons of hash, enough to stop them.
The police chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., according to information leaked by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The individual arrested was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit were conducting a traffic check on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and the check began.
The police began to chase them until the vehicle stopped two kilometers down the road, where the two occupants got out to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish balls, and they took it to a police station for a thorough inspection and for weighing of the drugs.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "forged" as it did not match the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with falsifying documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The detainee, 28-year-old A.A.J., has been remanded in custody to complete the procedures and will be tried in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her doing strange moves while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California State Police Patrol.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was pushing the gas, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and reversing several times, she rolled on her sunglasses".
Shortly after, the witness, who had not initially recognized the actress, saw Locklear pull over in the middle of the highway and get out of her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented", which is why the officers took her to the drug and alcohol unit for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "based on the police officers' first-hand observation, we believed Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was incarcerated at approximately 7:00 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from the Arizona clinic where she was being treated for a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to take responsibility in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is up to the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former youth and sports councillor of the Seville Municipality, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of favouring his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take its responsibilities", Llamazares said of the political party's behaviour in the Seville city council.
However, the leader of the United Left called for investigations to be "transparent" about any irregularities Silva may have committed: "The United Left has always advocated for this kind of case to have the maximum degree of transparency".
He also pointed out that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Blood of Mayo", the bold bet of Garci
Based on the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
The filmmaker tried "to put on stage the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis" he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two and a half hour film, "Blood of May" will be released in cinemas next Friday, which will then become a four-hour Telemadrid TV series.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, says that he has realized with this film "a childhood dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago to make a film commemorating the 200th anniversary of the 2nd of May in Madrid, something he always accepted when the narrative was based on national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid municipality are a "unique opportunity" for Garci to recreate with the right sets and clothes the atmosphere of "a Spain that has mistaken the leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellion under Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding like for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Blood of May", because he could not shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Return to the beginning" has influenced his usual way of working, the staging of the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the filming and whom he does not cast, since he finds this "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" rehearse in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "Los girasoles ciegos", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known", he said.
With this movie, Garci doesn't expect a prize.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and now you're just making one more film", Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón is playing the role of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A dancer from Seville is going to pay tribute to a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three moved to London with her family.
She was a freestyle dancer and an oriental dancing specialist.
She had an exciting life, pioneering women's liberation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two world wars fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me the role of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia and I thought it was amazing".
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life story but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of her dances reminded me of flamenco.
So "butterfly dance" reminded me of a Cuban folk dance and "serpent dance" in some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance style was identical to his", she says.
The production was made possible by two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally willing to collaborate with her former student.
"Matilde transforms Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy that she has accepted a role in my work and I am honored".
The production was also made possible by the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas".
It also tells, in a way, the story of this woman who exhibited in such faraway places, especially for the time, like India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it was these women who had a huge influence in their time and now nobody knows and appreciates her work", says Bayón.
The show starts at 8:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of "Diary of a recently married poet" in the Church of St. Stephen in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
Thus, the "Trinity of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Poplar of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, will go to New York during the International Congress.
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has purchased eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America is less likeable without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them".
This line is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absent Evil", and it illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and of America as a whole, at the startling idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
It hasn't been on since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a big blow to everyone.
"Sometimes one's feelings are beyond words, and now I have lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of his existence".
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of film and country died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and the stock markets were in fear, the esteem of Americans was plummeting, desperately searching for reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and there's no reason to live, all that human beings have left is admiration and you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He was the epitome of beauty and truth for all.
He was an enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and defeated causes, such as the Anti-Drug Foundation created in honor of his eldest son who died of an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that has struggled to fight a suicidal food culture.
This wave of admiration swept Hollywood regardless of nationality or passport.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond had died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the highlight of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set the bar high", observed George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to break through the screen like Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious private life and away from goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle of today.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful despite many opportunities to be unfaithful.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my house, when I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he is proud to see his daughters meet his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he was never more proud than of being a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and philanthropist", they say.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympics
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympics, after the failure in 2012, that could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
We are not, as we were yesterday.
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been eliminated.
But let's take a closer look at everything and start at the beginning.
Mistakes start with the backs being removed, which forces you to go ahead.
That's not bad, but if they move you, it'd be better if they gave you everything (including the chip for the shopping).
Well, no, you didn't.
They made you go there just to get the backpack (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long line) surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What kind of world are we living in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only low-size jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Besides the fact that you have to get there very early to get the chip, the line is 15 minutes long, and you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long line, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once we did, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which there was rebellion and assault on the barracks.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, we won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that I think didn't start correctly.
Of course, if I were asked to give an example of a perfect race, I would not think of it.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference Microsoft presented a new system for image recognition and human interaction, a kind of AI with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a shuttle to get around the company campus) in response to a question during a conversation.
Using a camera and a face recognition system, the "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - including remembering where they are - and listen and hear the key words in their conversations.
But also grouping them into conversation groups.
In the video presentation, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she is not part of the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she says she'll get back to her in a few minutes.
All this without a blue screen.
That's very impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, like the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we also talked about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it won't have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the essentials instead of the useless applications, they would run five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft has been adding features and "extras" to Windows version after version.
A change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing its importance, but so is its software.
When Google Chrome came on the web, I was one of those who subscribed to the theory that Google Chrome was Google's first move to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the indispensable basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It's like your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
- I know.
It will never go away but the "death" of the operating system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the Internet browser.
You just turn on your computer to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time surfing the Internet than they do browsing windows.
Who gets half the apps that come with the system?
Who can do more can do less.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much fewer than Vista.
Less heavy, less crowded, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and I'll give you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft's Redmond employee lounge.
On the beverage dispenser, a sign asks them to use their own research tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66 percent of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It won't be out in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or maybe 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more like a computer.
But with Android being late to launch and the iPhone already on the market, it's going to cost them.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather and it's part of the outfit of the Muscular Gay Association.
And if we were to list all his appearances, we might as well list this big mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It's not just a simple men's cotton body suit, molded and sleeveless.
The English call it a tank, but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since he is named, according to legend, after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag that the most famous body suits have around their necks.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand doesn't just make tank tops.
But she also makes sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, baby boots, mini-shorts.
Clothes designed for comfort underwear.
Although it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They're too charming.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
Her enormous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters are taking their new business in fashion very seriously.
Monica says it's not just pretty, famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand did in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish house.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
It's a very intense but exciting day ahead.
What is your new Mango collection for season four based on?
We love the movies of the 1950s and 1960s and we draw much inspiration from them for our collections.
I love walking around the city and watching women and how they dress, how they combine their clothes, I do that a lot.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman: aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
I've loved clothes since I was a little girl. I wanted to go to my grandmother's house and look in my aunt's closet and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to be careful about how I dressed.
Dancers like to dress up for classes and exams, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you put on the clothes that's when you really put yourself in the character's shoes.
So it's all connected.
You were 30 not long ago, was that hard for you?
No, not at all.
I feel better than ever, I'm happy to be 30.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
I'm not afraid of the biological clock.
I did all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mother because my body wants me to be a mother, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
I'm really looking forward to them coming out.
I'm a woman from the theater, I'm very impatient and worried, I wish I had everything now but of course it's not possible.
I can't wait for the movies "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" to come out.
Let's see what you think.
A few days ago, you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go up on the catwalk to be a model.
It's just that Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite a while, to invite me to London to participate in a charity parade for her women's support organization, and the clothes we were showing -- I showed two of our clothes from our collection created for Mango -- were being auctioned off to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People like Naomi is a kind hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, a lot of things aren't true.
And I'm fascinated by Naomi's good side.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to be the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Repeat drinkers will have to install the alcohol lock system
The Home Office wants drivers who have more than three administrative penalties for alcohol in their vehicles to have a system installed in their vehicles that prevents them from starting the vehicle while drunk or not breathing.
The initiative was announced last June and is now reflected in the State Minister's report, which describes it as a pilot project for a year.
The aim is to reintegrate the driver into the workforce by offering him/her rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety will also be involved, along with the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institut Technological de la Sécurité de l'Automobile Foundation.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of drivers arrested for drunk driving more than once take up the wheel.
The alcohol lock would prevent this as it is a system plugged into the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe in first; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than the permitted level.
The cost is more than EUR 1.000 and is borne by the driver.
In this respect, a 2007 study in the United States showed that vehicles equipped with the system reduced offences by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 lives a year.
This measure is based on administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done through ordinary channels but, however, reform through criminal channels requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
The Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party to install this system in school buses as it has been done in France.
Mexico without peep-toes
At 5:40 p.m. local time, the Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince of Asturias landed at the Presidential Hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was about to set, but its rays still forced me to put my hand in as a visor so I could see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other officials were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to complete their official tour.
- Oh, well, then we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour...
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, very well.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Several of them are waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military line of 27 marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, while she has windy hair, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They stop briefly at the photographers before passing into the hall where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny reporter from the Mexican television is waiting for them.
The Most prestigious fashion award
There is surely no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is surely no more extraordinary living and good-living cartoonist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of new fashion talent.
The winner will be awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her models in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she was almost crying from emotion.
It is the second largest store of the brand in Europe, which has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters.
The first store is in London.
The events, along with the desire to thank stylist Valentino, chairman of the jury, led to a lavish dinner at the Garnier Opera House in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family sitting next to it, the presidential table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
With a heavy heart and a good heart against bad luck, because of her brother's recent death, Nati put on a Mango dress and some breathtaking ELAH jewelry, and arms above, arms below with her son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters tall  she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store in a pair of pants and a shirt  from her own collection - and who for dinner changed into a sexy, black long dress - was moved when during the night tour of the opera house, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and, remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and made a 'big bend' gesture.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit to the palace premises, but she showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez  another handsome man riding a motorbike - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets and towels and having asked in advance that there be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, this is life.
1001, the number for stress
There are not only a thousand but a thousand and one ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they're all listed in a book that will bring relief to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock sounds almost sad every morning at seven o'clock, but it's even more sad when you think about the hectic pace of life we live in.
The office is a stress machine and the computer is a back pain machine.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
But there are no two ways to combat daily fatigue and the problems of the workplace.
But it's a hundred and one, not one more, not one less.
Apart from yoga, massage and spa treatments, Susannah Marriott has put together a book with a menu of methods to suit each individual's taste and time.
The book is entitled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will be available in bookstores directly from Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that peace of mind cannot be found in places like work or through personal relationships, the manual contradicts that belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100 percent natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline isn't running through your veins to restore your body's balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not talking about people who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk in their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a mild sleep disorder called somniloquy.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one who talks in the night.
This may occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example, associated with a high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month, etc.), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its occurrence.
They are often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting, or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As mentioned earlier, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations, or overexcitation.
It's a little-studied phenomenon anyway.
The intensity with which it occurs also varies greatly.
He may speak in a small, quiet voice, with isolated words, whispers or, on the contrary, with shouts, cries, long speeches ...
If sleepwalking becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for the problem.
We said it's a mild disorder, so there's no treatment unless it's related to another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it's related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to bed.
So look for games that are peaceful and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
As soon as you start sleepwalking, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Practical Advice
Don't wake him up.
It's no use, because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even though he talks, he's asleep and resting.
Remember, if the child is repeatedly showing signs of severe anxiety, it may be wise to see a doctor or to check what is causing the child's anxiety.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to ask him questions to get information.
You won't get anything, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
You will also hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell a child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even in a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, do not worry, it is not a bad thing, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern has finally found its way back to victory on its own soil after a long period of famine.
Without making a big game, the Yellow and Black created the most chances and managed to turn one of them into a game winner.
The pace was not very steady during this match when the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by visiting Captain Kauffmann who was close to the window on a shot from afar, Illhaeusern would take the lead slightly and turn to Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Roman of the Foot or Diebold would come tickling the defense of Dannemarie.
On the other side, we were blocking in the middle of the field and just leaving the roaring Riahi on the front line of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening score for the Illusiens by Marais, well positioned to take back a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illusians' scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause any problems to an Illhousian Eleven who just backed down a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of play when, after a big shuffle, the ball passed very close to the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
In view of the demonstration of force by fishermen who on Monday severely disrupted access to several Breton and Normandy ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit coincides with a general meeting of the 'crisis committee' set up by Breton fishermen to get action on the soaring price of diesel, which has reached a record high of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to the spokesman for the Elysée, David Martinon, the President will "discuss with them what solutions can be devised to help their companies to become competitive again and to secure the employment and pay conditions of the seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is being held up by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina was also blocked, but the links to Belle Isle were not.
A filter dam has been put in place on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest and Lorient at dawn on Monday, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and English Channel coasts, such as the Sands of Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers remained at the docks, and Le Havre, where some 20 ships blocked the movement of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer authorities have decided to wait until the meeting on Wednesday at the Ministry to decide on possible action.
The 'crisis committee' at Guilvinec is due to decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their move.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up anything" and "do not want to move to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chair of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents a litre but they believe that the threshold for profitability of a boat is only reached with diesel below 0.30 euros a litre.
Paul Newman the gorgeous
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid tribute to the legend of cinema and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession looming over the world economy.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, is maintaining its forecast for 2008 deliveries of 215 aircraft, its chairman Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has high hopes for the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG is planning to sell more than 15% of its assets
American International Group, the insurance company that was bailed out by the U.S. monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets to pay back the $85 billion it was owed, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider selling most of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement business in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to discuss possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG is planning to divest include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these divestments, FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting current shareholders proportionately.
Paris Historical analysis of the morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic drop on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's bank bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a record loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has plunged 777.68 points to 10.365.45.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day trade resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Wall Street, already depressed at the beginning of the session, has plunged after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan that was supposed to restore some stability to the markets.
By a vote of 228 to 205, the delegates denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market that Congress is unable to pass a plan", said FTN Financial's Lindsey Piegza.
"It shows how much the market was counting on this", she added, fearing that a draft adopted in a few days would come "too late".
"If the project is really dying . . . then the Fed and other central banks will quickly be handed the reins of handling the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza said.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, authorities arranged for Wachovia's banking business to be bought by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, prompting emergency intervention for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not just a US crisis, but a global crisis", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3,632% from 3,827% on Friday evening, and the 30-year Treasury note to 4,161% from 4,357% the day before.
Obama wins the first televised duel by points
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House was followed by another to see who won, John McCain or Barack Obama.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters declared their own victory in this televised duel that was reportedly watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while respectable, was not "brilliant" enough to reverse his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49 percent to 44 percent to McCain), believes the Democrat has gotten his act together.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who matter, Obama emerged victorious for 39 percent of the people polled, while 25 percent of them gave McCain the win, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, in his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts", Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has repeatedly stressed his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while pointing out his opponent's "naivety" on the issues at the heart of this first face-to-face meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he repeatedly accused.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", he said.
A point of attack that's been hammered into Republican TV commercials since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he was the future.
He was concise and specific.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions, and restore America's image in the world.
"McCain still doesn't get it, but Obama does", a Democratic commercial said this weekend, blaming the Republican for not fully understanding the impact of the crisis on "the American down the street".
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama said yesterday to 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina in heavy rain for an election rally.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial debacle clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by Americans as the most capable of saving the economy from the brink.
"The coming week could be a watershed", said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
The current debacle, he said, "is the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating that he would still be able to reduce taxes by 95 percent for Americans despite the upheavals on Wall Street, the Illinois senator also signaled that achieving the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his top priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have cautiously dodged questions about the $700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress last night that was extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice there was an election, did you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening after polling stations closed on the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admitted not even voting, saying: "Why should I, since they will do what they want with my vote?"
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression on foreign observers in order to regain its relationship with the European Union is ready for a democratic turnaround.
Sanctions, including a visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the election is deemed clean by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting", lamented Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of 12 parties.
"This is a cosmetic change", says Alexander Milinkievitch, a former opposition presidential candidate in 2006 and a leader of the pro-European movement, "because it is who counts the votes that counts, and here the executive is the most important.
If opposition MPs enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean TV space, regional meetings and legislative proposals".
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, goes into crisis, and we don't reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent".
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the election process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stresses that turnout seems too high and that the widespread use of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the door to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice there was an election?" asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be at most five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power".
The silence of the night falls on the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are celebrating their success.
Interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained the public's trust, which had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the national blood banks managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In response to this tragedy and the public outcry, the government of Canada instituted a public inquiry in February 1994, presided over by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.
While Judge Krever was delaying his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has fulfilled this mandate.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, only 38 percent of people still trusted the blood system in Quebec", recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and fieldwork over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence", she says, before proudly stating that by early 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population now trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary remembers that "trust is extremely fragile".
From the moment of its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, Europe was witnessing a large outbreak of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the agency that has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious illness may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain and inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures should be introduced.
In April 1999, blood was refused to those who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
However, a few years ago it was shown beyond a doubt that the disease is transmitted by blood.
This incident showed us that the precautionary principle was sound".
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV test technique was introduced: the nucleic acid test (NAT), which detects directly the presence of the virus itself in the blood of donors, rather than antibodies against the virus, which were the basis of previous tests.
TANs have shortened the silent period between the time a person is infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, she says.
This period was reduced to less than a week.
This has greatly reduced the risk that some donors may be infected without being aware of it and without being detected.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from blood transfusions.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that today people can feel comfortable accepting or prescribing blood transfusions to get better", says the head of Hema-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island. Like the West Nile virus, it is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure that the Community's energy supply is adequately supplied.
"Needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to be recharged with red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population is also affecting the blood donor network, which has an average of only 3 per cent of Quebecers eligible to donate blood".
However, anyone who is healthy, 18 years of age or older and who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who donate their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is rampant, they will be excluded for a year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But we need to replace the members of this network of donors as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it is especially difficult to deter and encourage them to become regular donors.
"In today's fast-paced world, it is rare to find time to give blood for an hour", laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Québec.
The umbilical cord, once considered a biomedical waste, is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample a few weeks ago and plan to collect more than a thousand a year.
We should start offering them for transplantation early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it", because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Québec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the USL First Division playoffs semifinal round with a 3-1 (4-3 on aggregate) win over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and deciding game of the quarterfinal round on aggregate at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first game of the round-robin series on Friday, the Impact were defeated 2-1 at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder closed a 3-1 deficit in the rematch to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still made it to the semifinal round 5-4 on aggregate.
The Impact are scheduled to play the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's winning goal
The number one Canadian trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the offense in a 3-2 Canadian home run win over the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the Tricolore's fourth in six preseason games.
Kovalev scored the only goal of the shoot-out.
"I'm not ready yet", the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable".
"He tried to do too much in the first half", said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He got a big round of applause".
Charest's move to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling elections before the end of the year
Shortly after the Liberal Party's general council ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
'Pushing the boundaries of our last great northern frontier': this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad outlines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was a sort of picture mill.
The three large screens were used to show spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, and Quebec as seen on Google Maps, maps, and so on.
Big money, like in an election.
In a press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out calling an election this autumn, although he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic area", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening up of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - had never been presented.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but gave no timetable, investment amounts or precise priority in future projects.
At most a few of the avenues for further development: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, supported by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The north contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", Charest said.
This "territory twice the size of France", is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it in our house, but it is in us", he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future", he added, after taking a dramatic pause to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The north, 70 per cent of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the premier said at the press conference.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and when the opportunity arises I reiterate that position on behalf of the government", he said.
"With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the north", he said, referring to the northwest passage, which will be open all year round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the local people, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ MP for Ungava), have already started consultations with some 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place, began work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give each other a common vision".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of Liberal prime ministers before him.
"Like the Liberals before us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed to rename the Beauharnois Power Station to Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Revolution quiet and nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has forged the future", said Jean Charest.
In a press conference he referred to another conservative reference, that of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In discussing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest stressed that it was planned to be commissioned in 2012.
"It's between us, but I plan to be there", he told his supporters, to a standing ovation.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election this autumn, which the law allows.
He stressed that his schedule was, however, full, including a Federation Council mission to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed like a letter in the mail: the PLQ in particular demanded the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to give them a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition has been skeptical of the outline of the Northern Plan.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, highlighted the policy of development of the North of Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
She said the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, had abandoned its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today", said Mrs Marois, standing with her Jean-Talon candidate, Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is that it is not just a show", said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - A country dishonored
It was Mr Vic Toews, former Justice Minister in the Harper cabinet, who last summer dared to call Louise Arbour a "shame" for Canada.
To cast such a disgrace on this woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government which is the only one among all the Western countries involved which has not repatriated its own national imprisoned in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the alleged crimes.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier die in inhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on a mock trial to determine the guilt of the accused.
It should be noted that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can enjoy a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that is turning a blind eye to torture, not caring that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', the word that Harper keeps brandishing and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when no morality exists: a Canadian citizen can be mistreated, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned at the will of a minority government leader (what then after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that promotes Virtue, Law and Order. They do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free speech - The Orwellian discourse of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house in an attempt to launch a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge by the truth, especially in cases of defamation, but by the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring ruin to anyone who dares to take a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal arms, against an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is often to bankrupt the defendants in order to impose a settlement that will gag the opposition and scare anyone who dares to look into the matter again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the facts to the public.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, debates in Canada are normally held by exchange of ideas, not by battering.
The mining industry had only to open its books, its files and start a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to distrust public opinion and repudiates petitions and letters of support for the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both call for a public debate and disregard the opinions of that same public?
In the vice-presidential world, it seems that this word refers only to the well-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that's a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have a right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports the writers and publishers of Black Canada is doing so primarily because they reject the brutal way mining is done.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in what many perceive as a gag-a-thon (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a notice to the authors of Black Canada instructing them to stop using the term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal rhetoric, the Barrick Gold lawsuit is a direct attack on academic research freedom and the search for truth, which are essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in its entirety, the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are not pleasing to the rich corporations of this world in a country like Canada, under the threat of repeated lawsuits, who will?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right to an answer.
The academic community, of which we are a part, has long been skilled at dealing with debate and disagreement and resolving conflict.
Barrick Gold's excessive prosecution makes it clear that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stem the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
It includes: better control by elected officials over its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default, and a right of access to the salaries paid to the heads of firms rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican negotiator Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news just minutes after midnight yesterday after a marathon two-day negotiation.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in markets", said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"This is the bottom line: If we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense", said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had been at a standstill in the last few hours over fears of the effect of another failure on investor sentiment.
The deadline we agreed on was for the markets to open this morning.
The two candidates for the US presidency, who were late in the negotiations, were rather supportive of the agreement, but expressed their displeasure that it had to be taken to that extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has claimed credit for adding provisions to the agreement, including one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and one on the salaries of executives of state-rescued businesses.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no reason to be happy.
But these measures are necessary", he said on American television.
Asked on another network whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so".
"The outlines I have read [show] that this is something we all will have to digest and move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan is to buy back with taxpayer money the dubious, risky, unsellable assets of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a freeze in liquidity and the bankruptcy of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elected officials who overturned the first draft deal last week.
We seem to have gotten out of this impasse since the Democrats accepted that some "toxic" assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
To make things even more clear for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to incur losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recoup its stake.
The new plan calls for a first payment of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
Another $350 billion should be approved by another vote in Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies that will pay dividends if they make a profit and which it can sell when the storm passes.
The Federal Government will be able to delay foreclosure proceedings on housing linked to the mortgage loans covered by this plan and to set limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the managers of the companies affected.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to a vote in the House of Representatives today, and then to the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their best efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be approved.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against the project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you", Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is about taking advantage of the taxpayers".
As the chairman of a small congressional group dubbed the "Skeptics Caucus", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman puts it differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: We are asking Congress to take its time and carefully consider the way forward", he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (US 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was abandoning the acquisition of its bankrupt competitor after losing €2 billion (US$2.9 billion) in the US subprime mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not a waste of money", said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, we get back a vote in the bank and influence.
This is something that savers and households are enjoying now that times are uncertain".
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalising another bank hit hard by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all loans in progress from the Bradford and Bringley bank, including over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) in mortgage loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would be the one to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the UK government since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Her blue-eyed beauty was long her card asset, some would say her weakness.
Had he broken free of the narcissistic mirror, the charming American actor with the smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and uncanny talent must have also kept him from the register of power that breeds the true sacred monsters.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at age 83 of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American film icons of the golden age.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and with whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.
Blood-blends often make beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No over-the-top ego, the ultimate in quality.
Because he was the self-made man of the country, the war veteran of the Pacific, wounded in action, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television, and soon cinema.
This same civil rights activist was also the motor racing driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, doubled as a sex symbol, although he was part of a model couple formed in 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
And with him, the shadowy parts of this secret, discreet, committed, show-business-allergic star, whose enigma has not been fully solved, disappear.
An honest man in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman has caused a stir among movie buffs this weekend as his major roles collide on the dark screen of memory.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual flux runs through him.
They come back to the memory of the charming cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Tin Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to Us (1990) tells the story of Mr. Bridge, a sensitive man troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all its promises.
So many other Paul Newman's have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role originally intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting, Oscar winner for best picture in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and a vengeful man in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he reprised his role on his return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 out of nine nominations.
That face through the ages, that was him.
It's him again.
The times are changing along her journey.
Young people know him best through George Roy Hill's cult classic Slap Shot (1977) as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the Irish mob's godfather in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Unlike many film legends who left the business early, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its luxuries and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "a living challenge to the underplaying" judging his performances too strong.
The profession was not always easy for the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles had long been in his mouth.
He played the young starlets less often, however, than the outcasts: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the deviations and rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true modest sensibility.
His 1968 Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, painted a fine portrait of a melancholy woman.
He lost his son Scott to a drug overdose and dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him.
In the rain of tributes to Newman yesterday, his close friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had acted together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said with great sadness: "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity, love of existence are vivid traits of the late actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against Hollywood's deviations.
Many have seen the meatballs sit on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process to be rather tasteless, though at first a bit of a hassle.
The profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that read: "Your father has always been incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And it's a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
A model citizen, in short, and more.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Co. be making in their invoice factory ?
The hearings in the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin shortly, on 8 October.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having caused particularly significant damage.
The prosecution claimed that the money from the grants was used for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipal funds, totalling some HUF 65 million, went to the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and to the pockets of certain individuals.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to collect the money from the grants by issuing invoices for costs, behind which no real benefit was provided and thus the associations never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were forged.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books from the market in Józsefváros, while they manufactured the pills in Kiskunhalas.
The names of the companies to be included in the invoices were decided, inter alia, during the tours to the province north of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the man's statement, he was supposed to be looking for guesthouses and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested an invoice, on the basis of which they made the other invoices that they would submit, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Capital Municipality to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information was mainly responsible for drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
On a "scouting trip", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag family in 2003, the restaurant catered for a group of 90 people, members of Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy the place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which was later renamed Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was full of errors of form and substance.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj had in fact only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could stay there overnight.
The imaginative invoicers also went too far when they mentioned Pigal Kft, also in the Horeca sector, and neither Jobb Jövőért nor Hoppá appeared in their accounts, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor's office called him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and tax number were misplaced on the stamp".
He added: "The fact that a hundred people stayed there, according to the bill, was not a good idea, either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which are not as spacious.
And the bill also says meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time".
The diligent invoicers also did not inquire about the travel agencies in Budapest, which were part of their choice but only arranged trips abroad, and thus naively reported stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which is also contrary to the agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as was apparent during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, whereas the supplies concerning travel activities, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate on the four invoices drawn up on behalf of Hotel Révfülöp on behalf of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear VAT of 25% as indicated, but VAT of 15%.
The investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office revealed that the 'issuers' also made mistakes in mentioning the transport of goods by road as a service, which the company issuing the invoices could not perform, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it was also for defective forms, such as inadequate invoice types and false stamps, that the invoices issued on behalf of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were found to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. and Kunfehértó's sports training centre, both of which deny that they are the authors of the invoices issued in their name.
The counterfeiters also failed to take into account the fact that HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation when (in 2001) the Fiatal Városértület Egyes group was supposed to have a meal at their house.
Invoices prepared deliberately
Another category of invoice issuers is those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has issued an invoice for the sum of HUF 4 million to the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was tricked into issuing false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation, cooperated with the Zuschlags and in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület for an amount of around HUF 5 million, but no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement took place either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was not mentioned in the accounts.
The next category of invoicing companies is that of companies directly related to the defendants.
Thus, the administrative deputy of the managing director of Delta Trió Kft., which was in charge of the fuel and motor vehicle business, and whose registered office was in Budapest, but where he was not available, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to about HUF 18 million.
The investigation showed that the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian national, to whom Iván Kubatov also allegedly sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and that he pocketed their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were functioning, which the defendant explained by the fact that they were not being given work.
He nevertheless made use of these companies, since at the request of Mr Zsolt Szente, co-accused and drafter of the company's instruments of incorporation, he issued invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave to the authorities 15 invoices in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution thought that 10% of the amounts listed on the invoices plus the VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up dummy invoices which were used in Biztos Pont's subsidy application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért applied for a grant from the public utility of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant for a double amount of HUF 500 000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this being known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In fact, these bills were found during a search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will relate the method of invoicing, as they had done before the prosecution earlier.
What might be really interesting is that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confession is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to give details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if not, the Socialists have reached an agreement that in return for the repayment of a large part of the HUF 50 million, Zusi will wear the hat alone.
Today, he is probably annoyed, as the requests for his house arrest, based on a reduction in his conditions, are continually coming to a deaf ear.
While those who have caused far greater damage, and the perpetrators of irreparable economic crimes, are walking around freely or at least waiting in their own homes for the end of the proceedings.
The psychology of overbidding: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and overvalue the goods.
Neuroscientists and economists at New York University have managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans don't want to be left out of this kind of competition, like an eBay auction, and that's why they're even willing to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, while the other group took part in a fun auction, while researchers used an fMRI to analyze the active brain regions of the experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction, a key element of which is the one-third overbid, the whole under the brain stem, called the striatum, would move vigorously when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the nervous system's "self-stimulation" mechanism.
Therefore, researchers say, the reason for the price increases is the fear of the violent reaction of the striatum.
To support their theories, the economists in this group of researchers continued their financial surveillance analyses.
In these three groups, one partner was overbidden in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they made their bet.
Another group was promised that if they won the game, they would receive an extra $15 as a reward.
While the third group received the $15 before the auction, the other group members also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is actually that the emphasis in one was on winning, while in the other, on failing.
In proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the "against failure" team were willing to place higher bets than those in the control group and the "for winning" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Each of these was based on the fact that the auctioning phenomena were based on the pleasure of winning and the risk of losing.
Only neurological imaging has helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories and now leads to a third explanation". - Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should we see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people have chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is the leading cause of death.
It is estimated that there are 100,000 patients with hepatitis in Hungary, but only 7,000 are being treated, because many patients are unaware that they are infected.
Hepatitis is a generic name for infections of the liver caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. While hepatitis B and hepatitis C are characteristic, the pathogens and the diseases they cause are different.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, are mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and bodily fluids (sperm, vaginal secretions, saliva).
It is recommended that travellers get vaccinated against A and B viruses. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A usually appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated food, usually accompanied by poor general health, weakness, stomach pain, and nausea.
Then a noticeable yellowing develops on the skin and white of the eye, the stool becomes lighter and the urine darkens in color.
Worldwide, one million people die each year from the most serious forms of this disease, such as cancer and cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that only about 1 in 10 people with this disease receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences. If left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know they have the virus because the pathogenic gene destroys liver cells in a subtle way, and in many cases the first symptoms do not appear until 20 to 30 years of age.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening are very important.
The infection rate is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and tattooed people.
Currently, there are an estimated 200 million people worldwide with chronic hepatitis C.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory testing, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as you notice symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured if it is detected early enough, the virus can be eradicated from the body, the risk of infection disappears and cancer is prevented.
World Hepatitis Day is observed on 30 September and was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by viruses, its causes and the importance of early diagnosis.
Does one who believes in God feel less pain?
Recent research has shown that religious belief acts as a kind of painkiller, which has already helped make Catholic martyrs' deaths more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph reported that researchers at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to see how belief in God can influence a person's tolerance of pain.
In this odd experiment, 12 Catholics and as many atheists were subjected to electric shocks while each was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to avoid much suffering.
Using a technique of human brain palpation, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experiment is carried out as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and spreading the electric shocks is fixed on the left hand of the experiment subject.
The researchers asked the experiment participants to look sustainedly at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind the experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, was for its soothing effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electric shocks in four successive parts, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed one.
Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary they felt "safe", "cared for", and "calmed down, and peace came over them".
When they saw the religious painting, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they were looking at Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image among atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image that they respond to very positively, like a mother or a father", said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases actually changes our personality", Wright added.
After these excellent results, the only question remains, what effect would it have on the pain regulation of the subjects if we showed the faithful a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would a better view of the Virgin Mary produce better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
For its tenth anniversary, Google says it can be found in the back of people's pockets just like the sky above their heads -- it knows where they've spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
But that's not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the most influential people in the industry.
While skeptics who draw parallels with Orwell's vision of horror are missing the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to collect even more information about its users, which is necessary for the founders of Google to be able to meet their original goal: "Let's collect all the world's information in one system".
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of working to turn the world upside down, they are still only at the beginning of their goal of being able to process all information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What job would suit me best?" but software will only be able to answer this simple question when it knows enough about users.
It is not clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer that initiates the search and the pages subsequently accessed by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can see what they've searched for, what they've clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long run, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous statements and our recorded preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my work is doing? users are asking, worried about Google's monopoly on information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can provoke a backlash among Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most notable example of this in recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google passed on to the Brazilian government the information it had collected from the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-conscious netizens were relieved last May when Google, in league with the electronic legal protection organization EFF, proved its case in court against the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier.
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is attacked by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and private domain suffer when they start using Google services.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "savages" of computer enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic users emerging in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the "fashion corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, which is being branded as the world's Windows invader, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and the continuously refreshed program package have a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very accurately the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what Web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, is pulling right behind it.
The Web 2.0 is really about collaboration, about the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and we use the communication channels that are at our disposal, and while the dimensions of these change one by one, the essence remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person can usually maintain a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and they can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing their music habits. Then they can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also maintain blogs, in which their latest photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
While there are many examples, such as the girlfriend who easily understands by seeing the morning photos taken by the circle of mutual friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the company that fired an employee, just for the honest opinions he wrote on his blog about top management, one thing is certain: the term privacy is totally reconsidered these days.
The person who lives an online life is what they show about themselves, and that's how we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's youth.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to get around Google's monopoly, can do so (by starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search engine, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that they cannot be traced is not small. Google online services, from word processing to image processing to reading information, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge server parks and do not fit our best profile, having existed until today.
The public is waiting, without really hiding it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with a current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten advertising agencies' revenue, while services introduced at an increasing rate are causing serious migraines not only at Microsoft but at many other computer programmakers.
However, critics find that there are contradictions alongside all this with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management rejected, in its entirety, the employees' protests after it doubled the price of the company nursery and after the company deemed the daily multiple catering too expensive, taken at any time.
One of the company's internal rules is that new services are only announced when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world to new heights. While some people think that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is getting so big that the company will soon be facing the U.S. Supreme Court, others are terrified of its health system, because in it, we can build a complete medical profit from our past test results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can provide a good raw material for the next generation of science fiction writers. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written in half-Orwellian tones, describes a future in which a man could be approached in a startling way just through Google data.
Two miners helped cover the tracks of the Ózd double murder
"The police have summoned two minors for questioning in the case of Ózd's double murder. Based on reasonable suspicions, they helped to cover up the crime", said the spokesman for the Borsod police department.
The young men have admitted to the charges against them, and are now being charged with complicity.
The two miners, who according to MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, are defending themselves.
As a contributor to murder, you can get up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the Ózd double homicide, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, premeditated and for profit.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and that is why he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday where he killed him and the man's 9-year-old daughter.
According to the information from the MTI, the young man had planned his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes, hidden at the crime scene, is proof of this.
The police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange is proposing to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal made by the Poles despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish State, which intends to divest more than 60% of its shares within a few months of the sale.
According to the Czech business daily E15, the Polish offer is the highest bid ever made for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have all made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not rule out the possibility that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market experts at between 5 and 10 billion CZK.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with about 25 per cent stakes, followed by the bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 per cent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, which is worsening day by day, the leading European newspapers are already talking about a "second 9/11".
"The global financial disaster is the fault of the American president", says the Rome newspaper La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to unite with his own party behind a hastily-made bill to help a desperate situation . . . "
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as billionaire Warren Buffett used to say, it's more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
Some of the Madrid press also see Washington as a scapegoat.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the failure of the political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing every day, and afterwards the whole world will pay the price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, but according to the congressional vote, a real danger loomed, one that Washington did not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the balance, just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer, says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some governments can still provide a lifeline to their faltering financial institutions, and with taxpayers' money they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither the financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to put aside their national selfishness and to centralize control over the divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weaker financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, said the Vienna daily Der Standard, adding that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in their pockets, deeply, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really addressed the crisis, which is like a tsunami sweeping across parts of the old continent.
The "saviors" do not have to wave a hundred billion euros at once, but it would be wise if they noted in which cases it would be rational to use taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What better way to develop technology to avoid obstacles than by mimicking an obstacle detector already in nature?
Like, for example, the bee.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired BR23C-type robotic self-driving system, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During their flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped space, which in reality, closely resembles our secure protective shell - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, the head of the brand's research and development and technological public relations department, at the exhibition.
The bee's faceted eye plays a vital role, seeing in all directions at a 300-degree angle.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, engineers have developed a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at a 180-degree angle and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, it measures the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns it into a avoidance maneuver.
The detection of the obstacle occurs in a fraction of a second, and then the miniature robot car, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any system in existence today, this avoidance maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If this were not the case, the mini-robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle", says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology is the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where collisions are currently considered inevitable.
All this process has to reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must be in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference can't be up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid other bees, in our case we could only use rotational motion, acceleration and deceleration as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a larger energy concentration, making them longer-lasting than the Lithium-ion version.
Andoh says that it is the instinctive intelligent response that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store it.
This mechanism must process and react to only a few incoming signals per second.
It doesn't need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
You don't need memory with a gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instant avoidance, which Nissan estimates will be introduced into mass-produced cars within the next decade.
Another application could be to incorporate it into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles in his path.
We even named the baby after a priceless baby.
The written version of the $700 billion bailout plan to buy back bad credit from banks, and use it multiple times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that money will be spent.
Reuters reports that in new debates that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, local East Coast time, congressional leaders agreed on the days-long controversy surrounding a $700 billion bailout plan.
"We have made a serious step forward", said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said the only thing left to do is put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born out of the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in a statement that the compromise would work and be effective, but that more work needed to be done. Pelosi said the plan was not to bail out Wall Street but to turn the economy around.
The written version of the plan was released before the Asian markets opened at 8pm local time in Washington on Sunday (or 2am Central European time on Monday), but did not cause the stock market to rise dramatically.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, after which its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The programme also differs from the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the $700 billion should be spent all at once on the repurchase of bonds on dubious loans.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent, the first $250 billion will be released immediately after the bill passes Congress, probably on Monday, and the first $250 billion will be used by the Treasury Secretary to buy off the banks' dubious loans, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The second half of the $700 billion is dependent on a new congressional order.
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able to simultaneously buy doubtful claims, securities for mortgages and doubtful mortgages, and other types of "toxic" claims.
The relevant persons in the Ministry stated that the purchases can take place in the context of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the possibility of taking part in an insurance scheme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that give rise to the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the tools needed to allocate $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it be the massive redemption of bad loans, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system causing the collapse of one or another major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed", he added.
On the other hand, bank managers in dire straits who are waiting for state help can expect their severance payments, simply called the transatlantic golden parachute, to be capped by the government.
The limitations are also dependent on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the enterprise.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury secretariat buys out in an auction, they'll charge a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Immediately after the redemption of the bad debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the new agreements are implemented in a way that is consistent with the objectives of the programme.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal limits will be in place on the appointment of chief executives, said House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat.
The government also acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks involved in the plan, thus reducing the risk to taxpayers, who may even be the winners once the economy and the bailed-out banks are back on their feet.
The bill states that within the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will determine how losses are to be reimbursed to taxpayers, starting with the financial sector.
There were, of course, those on both sides who expressed doubts about this plan.
That's not why the American people have mandated us, this doesn't protect taxpayer dollars", said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California.
His fellow Democrat from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes the same people who are pushing for action are responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices rose by 0.1 percent compared with the previous month and by 12.9 percent compared with August 2007, reports the Hungarian Central Statistical Office.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while they decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to a year earlier.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices rose by 0.7 per cent compared with the previous month and by 3.2 per cent compared with the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices rose only to a lesser extent: by 0.1 per cent, compared with the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in manufacturing sectors were only slightly higher by 0.1 per cent compared with July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2,8 per cent), with the manufacturing of bags and belts rising first with a monthly increase of 4,6 per cent, followed by footwear production with a monthly increase of 2,5 per cent.
The higher price level of raw materials in plastics and chemicals has led to a considerable monthly increase in prices in the manufacturing sector of products and chemicals (1.6%).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), in the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.9 per cent) and a slight increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, printing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the manufacturing industry recorded an increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which account for a large share of the national industrial operation, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales in the processing sector, the oil processing sector saw the most significant increase in prices (32.4%).
In the metal manufacturing sector, prices rose by 13.2%, while in the important food, beverage and tobacco sector prices rose by 11%.
Prices fell in the textile and textile products industries (2.5%) and in the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.3%).
In the other sectors of manufacturing, the price increase was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices rose by 10.2 per cent last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Among the groups of domestic trade and by sectoral breakdown, the sectors generating the highest monthly price increases (0.7%) were those generating the highest profit on investment in August.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3%, while those in the energy and materials for further processing sectors were unchanged from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared with the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy production and materials for further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-making sectors it was 1.4 per cent.
Export sales prices in the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared with the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro and 7.1 percent against the dollar, and compared with August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that around January 12 the US-Hungary visa waiver agreement will come into force, the Foreign Minister said in Chicago to leaders of the local Hungarian community.
She said: 'Now everything depends on when the transatlantic electronic entry and control systems will be put into operation.'
She pointed out that under the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The Hungarian foreign minister will be in Washington today for negotiations.
He will meet Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will receive the Commander's Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will meet with foreign policy advisers to presidential candidates Barack Obama, a Democrat, and John McCain, a Republican.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major party presidential candidates, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout of the government, but some politicians are demanding the US Treasury Secretary resign.
After days of marathon negotiations, congressional and administration officials finally announced Sunday morning that they had reached agreements in principle on the bank bailout plan.
This financing plan, aimed at easing the Wall Street crisis and crippled credit markets, became the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as better suited than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the economic issues coming to the fore, Obama has again managed to get a little bit of a lead, and McCain's lead, which he got with the nomination of Sarah Palin as a running mate just after the Republican convention, has melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection provisions which he himself supported.
"Now is the time to act responsibly... your jobs, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy are in danger", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We're all going to have a hard time swallowing it . . . but doing nothing is not a viable option".
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the creation of a Treasury Oversight Committee and a ceiling on senior executive severance pay, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that there are serious hopes the House will vote on the bill as soon as Monday.
The German-speaking area's press magazine
The right wing is intact, but only at the heart of the party have voters become more aware - as Der Spiegel, the Bavarian CSU's lowest score, points out.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel
In the online edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article titled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists transformed Bavaria for decades and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of epoch is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely just ten years ago came to a close: the undisputed hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU scored 47.7%, the first time since the 1950s that it had scored below 50%.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the time of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the "parent-eating" modernization system that the CSU has consistently implemented in the region.
The social scientists have been predicting this for 40 years but they have been very wrong about the pace, but the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of North and East Germans in the developing region of Bavaria could not remain without impact on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right wing is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it has been precisely the groups of ordinary citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, artisans, bachelor's degree holders and university graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? Party presidents stand on the sidelines in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of confused domestic politics that has developed after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The populist BZÖ party is open to negotiations, while the Greens are still unwilling to agree on a coalition.
The elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public television, party leaders barely show their cards.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ chairman, confirmed that he was willing to talk to the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is already the case in some regions and in the Socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he has said, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was in any case rejected.
A replica of this suit is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely fail if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
The choice of opposition or coalition membership is a momentary open question in his party, and these points must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, is once again open to any proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities", Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union, opened in Paris.
In her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers for the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP for Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the right that most affects Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, the high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The consultation will include the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party group, Járóka warned that apart from the distinctions observed in hiring, Roma are disappearing from the labour market primarily as a result of their low qualifications.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma youths do not have a secondary school diploma, and as a result of poor quality primary education, only a small proportion have the opportunity to obtain a higher education diploma".
Járóka also stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the enforcement of other fundamental rights.
Investing in early childhood education for Roma children means strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The earlier a Roma child starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market; by means of taxes paid on his income and consumption, he contributes to the state budget.
"Given their European Union citizenship, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education and protected from low-quality and sectarian education", stressed Lívia Járóka.
The MEPs also stressed that the EU should work together to ensure that the EU's policy on education and training is implemented in a way that is consistent with the principles of the European Union.
'The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by democracy so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe,' he said.
In the name of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the aim of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe, which has been held annually since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken at European and Member State level to promote equal opportunities and fight discrimination.
CSU: grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summit has been postponed.
The party chairman, Erwin Hube, and the regional government leader, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their seats.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party congress, held the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, at any rate, made it seem that they do not particularly care for their seat.
This was done to appease the angry members of the faction and the rank and file, who the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for losing the absolute majority.
Five years ago - and it is true that, at the height of his career, the Socialist Christian Union was still led by Edmund Stoiber - it won 60.7 per cent of the vote, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only 43.4 per cent.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "sole ruler" of Bavaria, contributing 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
But the Conservatives still have a strong hold on this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, who was presented as Huber's possible successor, was also given a place in this modest recognition group, which is initiating groping discussions with the FDP liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange twist of fate was that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as a pretext for the Huber-Beckstein coup, was brought into the legislation with the help of the Free Voters list, and then treated the highly ambitious female municipal politician with ruthlessness.
Now the CSU leadership is putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein, one way or another.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now had been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also be given an active role.
On Monday, Huber made some harsh remarks to the CDU, saying they should have received much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will be able to return to the chancellorship only if they somehow rebuild, with a common force, the CSU, which played an important role in the national success of 2005.
Merkel, who is hardly hiding her disappointment at the fiasco, said the loss of CSU ground would not negatively affect the grand coalition in Berlin.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the social democrats still continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 to 0
No opposition MPs have entered the Belarusian parliament since Sunday's election.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which provides prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegal voting.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature in this country of 10 million people has been doing very well in opposition for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDFZ) had serious hopes that Lukashenko, renewing his presidential term for the fourth time in a dubious election, following the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would "allow" the presence of some opposition MPs in parliament this time.
In this way, the ODSZ has abandoned its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are not granted visas, was one of the opposition's expectations.
The fact that the OSCE, in evaluating the campaign, emphasized positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the prohibition of running for one third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already contested the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is still feeling a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia as separate from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU", Alexander Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain the case, despite the fact that "the government has been afraid in this parliament, which has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition is not planning protests in light of the results, but is trying to get its message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on that side: we have to have our opposition newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting sticks in our wheels for distribution, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even among the elderly", Milinkevitch said, referring to the fact that under the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the most officially supported layer of pensioners no longer really consider it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and growing trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'like a cemetery's silence,' is only a matter of time", says Milinkevitch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People don't believe in words, but in deeds".
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never in the history of Chigi Palace have we had revolving doors for employees to enter and exit.
But from today, this new measure is in force against the smart little guys, who point and then go to the bar to drink coffee during work hours.
The new anti-laziness measure was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
 Revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services", says the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It is reformism", Brunetta added.
The installation in all the premises of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
The Secretary-General said that there was no resistance from the employees: "It is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the cooperation of all".
In short, no breakfast during work hours; no coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, who smiles and suggests, "A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a great and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In the case of the Italian government, the minister said that "in three months, sickness absences of public employees fell by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year".
He added that it was essential to make the public administration more efficient.
The Minister explained that the Italian economy "has doubled its wage dynamics over the last 8-10 years compared with the private sector, and this is well above inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees have united to challenge the Brunetta Ordinance's use of the Codacons.
"While the Minister for the Civil Service is today publishing figures on the decline in absenteeism from work due to illness", writes the Consumer Association, "the number of 'active lazy' workers continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of honest and productive public servants have come together to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the TAR has been challenged by the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of disability on the grounds of service; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's home stay, during which the monitoring visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions intended by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: 'Prevention is crucial'
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 permanent disabilities.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that the white death toll was about 1,200.
The figures show the seriousness of the problem, which remains a major cause of death, killing almost twice as many people as homicide.
In order to draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media to this tragic event, the ANMIL is celebrating today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, which is celebrated on the second Sunday of October.
"The alarming data published by ANMIL, together with the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace", said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of ANMIL, the National Association of Workers with Disabilities.
The Head of State expressed his "sincere appreciation for the continuous efforts of the association in favour of workplace prevention, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and public awareness raising"
"Naturally outraged, everyone has been working to put an end to such tragedies which, by their scale, are attracting media attention and public participation, even if daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to keep our attention on this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm about the social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed that 'the phenomenon of the white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly'.
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but the number of white deaths is still impressive", said Pietro Mercandelli, president of the Animal Society.
We don't want this "discount trend" to actually translate into less attention, because that's exactly when attention relaxes, and tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general not enough is being done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and that the counter can be done through multiple actions".
 We believe that more controls and inspections are needed, as is greater intervention in training workers, starting from school".
- He added that "more work needs to be done in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a social emergency".
 Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work" and the "drift in assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
 The aim is therefore to restore the worker's insurance guarantee  he added- so that the fate of the accident victim does not depend on spontaneity or the expansion of the legislator"
MP3 players pointed at them, they're putting your hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent damage to hearing.
This is the message of the European Commission, which in a statement published in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Unforeseen and Recently Identified Health Risks (CSRSERI) in the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report", we read in the footnote, "it shows that 5 to 10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that so many young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume may unknowingly damage their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data", she continues, "this is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public domain.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can keep pace with new technologies.'
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the heavy use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
'The scientists confirm that there is good reason for concern and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to reduce this data considerably by using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (over 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits on the maximum permissible noise level in the workplace.
People who listen to music in such conditions for long periods of time are at risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This concerns 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
The Commission has been asked to leave Rome for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The committee is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented", Alemanno stressed.
No overlapping of roles, but only the desire to have a corner to work out a big project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and then disappear, because this experiment must have a precise time duration.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan for the future of Rome Capital, based on the work of the Commission".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure his contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is overwhelmed by the day-to-day management and the occasional emergencies.
We, on the contrary, want to look ahead, and further, to a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future".
The Mayor of Rome also emphasised that 'this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic setup: it is absolutely free, and will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, and will serve to study and involve the best minds who express the Capital.
For Alemanno, "a strategic reference framework, neither firm nor immobile, is needed to enable our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future with a united spirit".
A future which, the mayor of Rome said, "will not be limited to the usual municipal boundaries but look further afield, not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A prominent American politician who wants to be seen as an independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really a fool: he thinks he's going to win the highest office in a nation that has two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that don't say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president?
In this case, it's still someone who speaks with their heart and not their brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the heart of the southern United States, wrote an article: Once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
Now, an aspect of the American mentality that was kept secret until the end is emerging.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the black candidate's success seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all this reasoning, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1,500 people what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge job to do.
In the United States, the economic collapse is even felt by journalists: in the press, it is time for suppression.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly state to the news attachés, to feel less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed business model.
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, where the editors work on assembling the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public is to be reduced substantially.
An obvious but complex pessimism is pervading American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and print newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is going down the wrong path.
The local executive is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are making a move to the Internet, which many see as the "killer" of newspapers.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology in the hope that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest problem in American journalism is between who runs the newsrooms - the editors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers nationally are convinced that reporters share their values, whereas at the local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "job security".
The proportion of managers who think they will lose their job within three years is 47% nationally.
When it comes to journalists, we're going to 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a take-it-or-leave-it question.
The directors almost always get a big salary, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, after a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the weather.
The Commission has not yet received any information on the situation in the country.
The president of the second criminal division of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the appeal of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be allowed to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the Unipol-Bnl escalation investigation.
At his trial last week, he was granted house arrest, converted into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial town to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and gain access to the evidence against him.
The elite are in danger.
This was already evident a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms this, reporting that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, even more divided between its old, moderate East Coast soul, which is supportive of federal institutions and the business community, and its new, conservative soul, which is hostile to the Washington establishment and the financial world, which is especially powerful in the Central and Southern states.
The spirit, precisely, which was made to feel in a despotic way with the vote that I told you about at the beginning.
But what has just been said is just one example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake is heralding or is already setting in motion: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not just here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the phenomena which have been brewing for some time, to the point that in the new climate they are solidifying and revealing themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of State and sovereign, as opposed to a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which have obviously close relations with foreign countries, but which are above all involved on a large scale, the balances of individuals and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global but politically it is almost only domestic.
Political internationalisation seems to be out of the question or not at all: the clear proof is the European Union, which, as usual, is divided between different interests and national strategies and cannot decide on a common policy.
And so it is from the governments of each State that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a loan: when you go through a difficult period, only the States have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things right.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two invaluable resources, which no market or international organization can ever have in a comparable way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance which more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attach to a factor quite closely linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future would instead have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather non-material things like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth, but that are absolutely bound to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So whoever is sovereign certainly has more cards than whoever is not, that is, whoever is unlucky enough to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second new feature which, however, involves a fracture.
What says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for someone who can take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, there is a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow.
And then there's something even deeper, in a sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of alienation that tends to involve the entire executive class in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority, increases even more.
In short, the demand for leadership underground fuels a powerful and branching movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifests itself in the improvised electoral "riots" or, in the recent changes in collective moods, from the rise of conservatism in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of Labour in Britain, to the rebellion of US Congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not come by chance).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, some would say, are having increasing difficulty, which is not new, in understanding and therefore representing the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening, growing and potentially agitating in an unreasonable way.
In view of all this, it seems frankly exaggerated to talk about a current "mass revolt" on the agenda.
But as they say, keeping your eyes peeled is not without reason.
The super glue to walk on walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various research centers in the United States, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
Using a piece of adhesive that was only 2.5 square centimeters, researchers were able to hold a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
The study was published in the journal Science by researchers at the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the research team, is an evolution of the ones we know that use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have taken inspiration from the geckos' legs, which are covered in microscopic hairs that help ensure that the animal adheres perfectly.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass foil, showed that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time, it can easily peel off the wall", says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe walking on walls like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use, like connecting electronic devices, since carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
Another research team at the University of California, Berkeley, is also working on a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, researchers in California presented a glue made of hairlike microfibers that cleans itself of dust when moving on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, when combined with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, warns of the dangers of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, when they are associated with ingestion of certain medicines. At the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he raises a new alarm: one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some vital medicines, negating their beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized for being responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamina and neurological medications to toxic levels.
RISKED MEDICINES - The Italian Medicines Agency itself reported the news in a newsletter two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to be careful what they drink if they are taking drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
Not just the pepper - According to experts, even orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit medication.
There is a long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
The Commission has therefore decided to initiate a review of the information provided by the Member States on the use of the drug in the Community.
It is always good to read the package leaflet of the medicines you are taking and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist", the expert told Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in economics is going to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a prominent columnist for The New York Times.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration's most vocal critics of economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked much controversy, and was blamed on the economist for years, but now has been proven correct.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public view", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value" but also a "very aggressive style whistleblower, particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism".
Open Office, this is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
Today is the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite for personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is presented to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, the revised and less austere interface, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some functions specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphics development module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
On this front too, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine typical Adobe graphics with elements of a spreadsheet or word processor.
Multi-person collaboration is an element that has seen various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over edits, in the preparation of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a comment color for better recognition during the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some of the OpenOffice functions to the web, and in the coming weeks they should be releasing the final result.
The Italian version is available for download at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is in addition to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in the home, it is precisely in business that Open Office next tries the big challenge, already counting on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
This is not to mention the fact that they offer training, consultancy and assistance services, ideal for small and mediumsized enterprises, which could also open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video equivalent of Word; Calc, the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint's rival presentations; Dbase, like the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; and Drwa is the graphics module.
The target for 2008 is 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl's positive, too, this is the fourth doping case.
Another positive case at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, who qualified third, and won the jersey of the best climber.
This is the website of the daily L'Equipe reporting the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth cyclist to test positive for Cera, the third generation EPO, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests on Kohl's samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the test results are positive at the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place at the Tour and will be forced to face two years of elimination.
News of Kohl's third-generation EPO positive was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told The Associated Press that he had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian took the podium behind Spain's Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the best climber jersey.
Immigrants: New York Times asks whether Italy is racist
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a preferred destination for immigrants" who are being welcomed with reluctance.
The New York Times has written a long article on racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young man Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what The New York Times calls the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are both the ones with "more integration and more jobs" but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to incidents of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Even the new legislature that the Lega wants to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic emphasized this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano, in his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, called for the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism".
Students who are victims of high rents, up to 900 euros per room.
The student rental market is not in crisis
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such serious proportions that entire categories of young people are excluded from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families have to bear", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia Education Office.
In most cases, lease offers also contain a series of violations: unregistered, open-ended, no-limit leases, sub-leases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of taxation are needed to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it costs about 450 euros; for a single room, it ranges from 650 euros minimum (Bande Nere area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, a double bed costs 250/280 euros, and a single room costs 370-500 euros.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), the cost is about 600 euros for a single bed and 450 euros for a double bed.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single course) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The only way to save is to move to the outlying areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar areas.
In Naples, a bed costs 300-400 euros, for a single one, you spend 400-600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, a bed costs 250-350 euros, at least 350 for a single bed.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, in cities such as Perugia, where rent is often taken by students from outside the Community, there is a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that charged to Italians.
Goodbye old Paradiso cinema, the cities are emitting historic theaters.
The historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image, by director Giuseppe Tornatore, is a good example of what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial towns,
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the emergence of large multi-screen cinemas on the outskirts and the death of single-screen cinemas in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events which seems inevitable and indisputable to us.
The disappearance of historical places is often a memory-laden event, "it is as if a friend of mine disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a journey and so many emotions", says the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that won Tornatore its first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Jury 20 years ago, and which told the story of the poetry of a provincial cinema, and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema, lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, tell the whole story: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the main city cinemas have paid the most: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 fewer in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 fewer in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia-Romagna leads with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The first proof that the multiplex is responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplexes, as the three Italian regions have the most new multi-screen cinemas: 195 in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian operation has grown irrationally", says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. "It is useful to build new facilities, but the survival of existing ones must still be guaranteed, because when a theatre closes in a city, not all of these visitors are necessarily willing to go to the multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation on the credit to the merchants: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that from an ethical and moral point of view the Government does not respect the existing laws.
The support for the sector is estimated to be between EUR 16 and 18 million per year.
The first Italian city to address the problem of the closure was Bologna, which decided to sign a protocol between the city council and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote single-screen cinemas in the historic centre and on the outskirts.
The proposed rules include tax incentives for managers and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special rates for parking and in some car parks.
"I welcome this initiative", says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example and implement other measures.
It is clear, however, that to counter the superpower of multiplexes, traditional theatres must also improve the quality of sound and picture, as today's audiences are more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema de Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" which I had already been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the now-closed Quirinal de Via Nazionale, where I've lived so many shared emotions, I turn the other way so as not to see the signs blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
 The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to make the choices of the City Hall consistent with the interests of the Piromalli clan".
The Magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria have launched serious charges against the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external assistance for Mafia association.
The controls are also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the boss's namesake, already convicted of mafia-type association, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all to common sense", the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Mr Piromalli.
"This would have allowed the clan", the judges wrote, "to enter the town halls officially, facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and guidance of the public administration".
Agazio Loiero, chairman of the Calabrian regional committee, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest"
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, when police announced they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
As early as the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and again because of alleged links between organised crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 rally.
He shouted out when the prefecture ordered the municipal council dissolved.
He accused the then Deputy Interior Minister, Marco Minniti, of having orchestrated the whole thing for a political issue, but given the arrest warrant signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan even managed to request a change in the A3 project.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy comes from waves, now the big ones go.
This is an enormous deposit that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that giants like Chevron have set their sights on, and now are trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movement of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental concerns and the new increase in oil are giving a big boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by offshore systems.
This would be twice as much as the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Colossus is on the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would have seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years on, more and more of these companies, which have always been committed to traditional energy, are turning to marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies", a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is evaluating opportunities to work with us".
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to develop a marine energy project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially when you consider that in Alaska, the United States is still drilling for oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which are exploring the sea energy route, and the amounts invested to date, although details are unknown, indicate, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts say the technology is still in its infancy, partly because marine energy is not allaying fears about environmental impact.
At present, systems like those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to pose a major problem to the ecosystem.
However, large-scale energy production requires the use of technologies with a higher environmental impact.
And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The wave force, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure drives a turbine, which in turn, powers a generator.
The power is sent to the shore through undersea cables.
We have four such systems in the design phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, by contrast, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines on the East River in New York.
The movement of water at high tide, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating motion that powers a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, is now due to the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, among others, looking to the coast, invested $7.5 million in 2008 and are planning to invest up to $35 million in 2009.
