Members of the National Assembly for Wales are afraid they'll look like the Muppet
Some members of the National Assembly have been disappointed by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue has been raised by a plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A member of the National Assembly, who is a member of the Labour Party, said that his groupmates were concerned because it rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp.
For the sake of clarity, readers outside Wales, the indigenous word daft means scant and pwp means scant.
A member of the band said the group as a whole was not happy and offered other names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "receptive" to the change, but noted that the word MWP is very similar to Muppet.
For the record, the pronunciation of the letter w in the English language is similar to that of the Yorkshire u.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the Bill on the change of name, said: The final decision on all the names by which the members of the National Assembly are invited is of course made by the members themselves.
The Welsh Government's 2017 Act gave the National Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposals for the name, which broadly supported the idea of renaming the National Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of nominating members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name MWP to Welsh Members of Parliament, or WMP-d, but the public opinion poll was the most favourable.
Members of the Assembly are likely to offer other names, but reaching an agreement could prove a test for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including rules on the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly shall be left to the members themselves when the legislation is debated.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is to resolve decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to that territory and has repeatedly objected to its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he intends to reject the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue that the name change is only the price a country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's clocks are silent because the churches of Harlem are in trouble.
"Older people I've talked to have said that once upon a time there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
None of them.
He said the bar disappearance was understandable.
"People communicate differently today", he said.
Bars are no longer the living quarters of the neighborhood where people stay every day.
As for the churches, he worries that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders hope, and sooner or later they will be back to square one.
Adams added that churches could be replaced with apartment buildings whose apartments are filled with people who don't visit the rest of the neighborhood without permission.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white, he added, thus speeding up the day when all these churches close their doors, as it is unlikely that most people living here will join them.
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis − Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The Black congregation, who had previously worshipped nearby, took over the building.
The congregation of African Americans at St. Martin's was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of shoppers on 125th Street on Harlem's main shopping street for refusing to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but when Father Johnson's congregation planned to restore it, they used the carillon, or clockwork.
The son of Father Johnson and heir to the St. Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson proudly named the carillon the "Poor People's Watch".
However, the expert who played the carillon in July gave it another name: cultural value and invincible historical asset.
Also noted by Tiffany Ng, a specialist at the University of Michigan, is that this is the world's first choir played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a larger choir at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church had not replaced him.
In recent months, the Church of St. Martin has been plagued by architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved in secular church leadership, others in the bishopric.
In July, the church's leadership, or secular leaders, wrote to the bishopric that the bishopric was "trying to pass on the expenses", even though the leadership was not even involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the bishopric.
Some members of the congregation complained about the poor transparency of the bishops' actions.
California shark wounded 13-year-old boy who was diving for the homarans
Authorities say the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving in California on the opening day of the hummer season to catch the hummers.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. at Beacon Beach near Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's apples and then swam with the others to help pull him out of the water.
According to Hamel, he initially thought the boy was expressing his enthusiasm for the humar, but then sai realized that the boy was screaming Mind was bitten!
I was bitten!
Her entire body was covered in bare bones, Hammel described the scene she saw when she reached the boy.
I called everyone out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The life-threatening boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of the attacking shark is unknown.
Rescue and Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were on the upper part of the skull.
For investigative and security purposes, authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas from Casablad to Swamini for 48 hours.
Giles added that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will take over the Boots, Super Rock and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-class beauty retailers with expert consultants.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.7 billion, which continues to rise as sales of fashion and home goods fall, larger beauty retailers will be tested in 11 stores across the country, with other stores launching them next year if successful.
The reason for the investment in beauty products is that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwave ovens and home shopping.
Sainsbury's said it plans to double its beauty product range to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
The existing product lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also given more space in branded shops, such as those currently available in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique range of make-up products, most of which are vegan-friendly as young shoppers are increasingly demanding them.
In addition, fragrance retailers are testing the exclusive licence at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second to open this year in Selly Oaks, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift to daily shopping for small amounts of food from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that retailers are becoming more and more like supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to combat low-cost retailers like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argose stores in hundreds of stores, and the same has been done with Habitat stores, since Sainsbury's bought both stores two years ago, which allegedly fueled the sale of groceries and made the acquisitions more profitable.
An earlier attempt by the supermarket to renovate its beauty and cosmetics departments failed.
Sainsbury tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up with a row over how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmaceutical products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury's sold its 281 sons' pharmacy three years ago for £125 million to Celesi, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxury skincare products to its four stores, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief business officer, said: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained staff who are always ready to give advice.
Our brands are responsive to every need, but our convenient location and environment mean we are now a competitive beauty destination that can change the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of business.
Dragons Dan star Peter Jones left the limelight when TV presenter Holly Willoughby gave up an £11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby's running out of time for the home goods and clothing brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of the television show This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons to enter the ranks of Dan star Peter Jones, stepping down from their luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was a "smoothie" when the television star confessed at a tense meeting at the headquarters of the man's business empire in Marlows, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new £1.5 million contracts meant she no longer had enough time to devote to the Truly brand of homewares and clothing.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK for one of his vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was definitely Holly's top priority.
It was to secure her future, so she thought she'd be doing it for the next couple of decades.
His decision to leave left everything about the matter in complete confusion.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to the launch of the product line.
Marlow's headquarters has a store full of ready-to-sell merchandise.
Experts believe that the departure of the head of the British TV show This Morning, one of the highest paid celebrities in the UK, could cost the company millions because of the huge investment in products ranging from sofa beds and candles to clothing and homewares, and could also lead to a later market entry.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as CEO in March.
Couple traveling together on vacation, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's production company.
Willoughbyst will become M&S's brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin on the ITV television series I'm A Celebrity.
One of Jones's sources said last night, "I don't want to comment on his business".
♪ Hard to talk ♪ ♪ For what we loved ♪
Trump mocked the criticism that was directed at him in the news for a comment that some consider worthy of the president and for being overly positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his funny news anchor voice:
I've never given up on anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea's disarmament.
But negotiations on the abolition of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a U.S. response to North Korea's initial disarmament efforts.
The president noted that the United States would continue to impose restrictions on the country.
Trump's encouragement was much more joyful.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We're doing great together now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results: the end of rocket tests, help to free hostages, and the return of American servicemen's remains.
He also defended his unusual relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside to get into this crowded stadium, it's better if we have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate the Indonesian island, killing hundreds
In order to eliminate the effects of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared as a prerequisite for international aid.
Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, so the story is a bit complicated, Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palus, it's not clear whether foreigners will be able to work in the region.
The National Disaster Agency's spokesman, Mr Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palus to decide whether international bodies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly unprepared for natural disasters.
Although there is a tsunami shelter in Aceh, it is not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was issued, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren likely increased the death toll.
Traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is also quite tempting at its best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stopped to treat victims of the Lombok earthquake is heading for Palusa, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's fragmented infrastructure a central part of his election campaign and has allocated the money to roads and railways.
But the budget deficit is threatening Mr Joko's government as new elections are due next year.
Mr. Jokot is also plagued by tensions among the liberal Indonesians, whose majority Muslim community has turned to the older form of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced by fighting between Christian and Muslim forces in the streets, using machetes, vibuses, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look, Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge is hitting a home run against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of the match at Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
Sturridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir, who was about 27 metres from the Chelsea gate when his team led 1:0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it in the direction of a post that was further away.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the top right corner of the net.
It fell with Cape Arrizabal jumping over and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get in that position, get the ball and players like Shaq are giving the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kant coming, I made one touch and gave a long, thoughtless blow.
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0 thanks to a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker feeds the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in that game before he turns around in midfield and feeds the Liverpool side.
Kovacic was giving a fast-food in the middle.
Then he created a beautiful air raid, leading to Hazard's penitentiary.
Hazard passed the defense and hit the ball with his left foot, passing Liverpool player Alisson Becker past a post further afield.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster authority said Sunday morning.
Large numbers of people were trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed on Friday after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused by a 50-foot [18 m] wave of shocks, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
With a population of over 380,000, the city of Palu was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for murder after he stabbed a woman to death
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Merseyside, Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with a gunshot wound was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling to contact people who may have seen or heard something in the area.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still very early, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to hear or see anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers whose onboard cameras may have recorded something, to contact us because they may have information of vital importance to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged female friends came to the scene asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police said they're reporting the incident to the woman's immediate family.
The cab driver living in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the house.
The man was upset to hear about the case.
The residents were told it could take hours to get back to their house.
A police officer reportedly told one man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
One woman was crying at the scene.
He kept saying, "It's awful".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still in the area and the third was just outside.
A bunch of police officers were standing in the area watching the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event is invited to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopper anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 using the password log 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell is the last monument which is the reason for the controversy over the rewrite of history.
Removing it would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style, which the man's inhuman vagrancy followers did.
But Cromwell's society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as stupid and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the removal of images, it was impossible to keep the memorial in front of Oliver Cromwell's Palace of Westminster intact.
Cromwell did not confiscate the images in the English Civil War himself or order others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas, the ancestor of the man, a century ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent Cromwell presentation is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historical record of the person whom many people still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people thought Cromwell's Parliament was more a defender of foreign pressure, and of course, of royal power, in the late 19th century than it is today.
Whether this is an accurate account is an endless historical debate.
It is certain that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the future development of our nation, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and memory.
A Chinese farmer was killed by a killer
Local media reports say a pig attacked a farmer's market in southern China and killed a man.
A man identified only as Yuan was found dead with a blood-covered artery near the seattle market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepared to vaccinate pigs at his table in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly came with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the man's cousin found him dead and discovered that the ear canal had been opened.
He said the neighbor was in a big, bloody mouthful.
The examination of the court examination confirmed that 249.47 kg of oregano had reportedly killed the farmer.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and bruised", Wu, the victim's cousin, told the newspaper "Guiyang Evening News".
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his niece.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, pigs have been observed to attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 200-pound pig was nailed to a tractor by a Welsh farmer until a man's wife scared the animal away.
When an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs do not usually attack, but blood tastes can make them go crazy.
They're just playful.
They're very curious maracras, not meant to hurt.
They just have to be respected enough, the man said.
The aftermath of Hurricane Rosa is bringing heavy rains to the southern United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken as it moves over the northern coast of Mexico toward cooler waters.
Nevertheless, Rosa is bringing torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southern United States in the coming days.
On Sunday morning at 5:00 a.m. eastern time, Rosa was classified as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 136.78 kilometers per hour, and it was located 619,59 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure atmosphere begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as a tropical storm approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, deep tropical moisture will begin to move toward the northern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will arrive in Mexico, where it will rain up to 25 inches [25 cm].
Subsequently, a tropical humidity response to the approaching low pressure will produce extensive heavy rainfall in the southern part of the country in the coming days.
Occasionally, between 2.5 and 10.16 inches [2.54 and 10.16 cm] of rainfall causes dangerous flash floods, flooding, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes rainfall to increase by five to about seven and a half centimeters per hour, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall between 5.08 and 10.16 centimetres is also expected in certain areas of the southern United States, particularly Arizona.
Sudden events are possible due to the rapidly deteriorating conditions of tropical rainfall.
Certainly, in the face of tropical rainfall, you should not walk in the desert.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into fast-moving rivers, and sometimes violent winds and flying dust can result in storms.
The approaching low temperatures will sometimes lead to heavy rains on the coastal areas of Southern California.
A total rainfall of over 1.27 centimetres is possible and may cause less flooding and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall in the region.
The scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, with heavy rainfall expected to reach Arizona on Monday night and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will hit Four Corners on Tuesday and remain until Wednesday.
In October, the United States is forecast to experience a major temperature increase due to the Arctic cooling, while temperatures remain high in the tropics.
Sometimes this results in large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday's weather is a great example of significant temperature changes in the central United States.
Temperature variations between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, reach nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, he's trying to collect his long summer heat again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm October with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to the national highway, reaching a maximum of 80 acres.
New York is expected to be at least 26.6 acres on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that the eastern United States is likely to experience high mean temperatures in the first half of October.
The trial of Brett Kavanaugh was watched by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people on Thursday watched the confessions of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who allegedly accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television channels.
Meanwhile, a political frenzy continued, with broadcasters cutting off regular broadcasts to reflect last-minute twists on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake contracted the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh crawled him drunk and tried to rip off his woman's clothes at his high school graduation.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
The transmission likely covered more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems calculating the number of people who watch transfers in public authorities.
By comparison, it's about the same audience as football at the finals or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel opinion leaders who have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment led all networks in a day-long session with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC with 3.26 million viewers came in second place.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued after the trial.
Flake was the central character in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying he votes for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught the man on Friday morning as he was getting under the watchful eye of the protesters trying to get in an elevator to a justice committee hearing.
He was standing there for several minutes when he was accused and it was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power, while so many women are completely powerless".
Flake said his department issued a statement and added before the elevator closed that he had more to say at the Judiciary Committee meeting.
The cable and broadcast networks recorded the live broadcast hours after the Judiciary Committee had to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he's only doing so on the understanding that the FBI is investigating charges against the candidate next week, which are being called for by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by a conversation with a friend of his, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat.
After a later discussion with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had an impact because it was clear that Republicans could not get Kavanaugh's vote together without confirmation from the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit critics for playing a political game
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the prime minister accused those who criticized his plans to leave the European Union of playing a "political game" with Britain's future and of undermining national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview with the paper, which featured Theresa May on the front page with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressured May's attack on what he called the Brexit cabal, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other is "totally brain-free".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of murdering an LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting to death 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, CBS's WAFB reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde.
The lawyer said the man's bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the neck area.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police Department and the people living in the area for their assistance in investigating the events that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for their commitment to integrity and justice.
Sims was 20.
A 6'2" man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
His average games last season were 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team was devastated and shocked by Wayde's death.
"It's something you worry about all the time", Wade said.
A volcano is spreading ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano as activity resumed in the crater, resulting in 183 gas and ash bursts in 24 hours.
The center was full of rumblings and quakes.
The images shared on social media depicted a car's windshield covered in smoke in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 km from the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with local police, and thousands joined the opposition to celebrate Catalonia's vote against its withdrawal.
A group of masked separatist fighters, held back by the police, attacked the last eggs and powdered paint, creating thick dust clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The riots continued after the police had to use daggers to control the fighting.
For hours, the independenceists, who sang "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness", clashed with the unity protesters who chanted "Let Spain Live!"
According to the local press, 14 people who suffered minor injuries during the demonstration received medical attention.
Tensions remain high in the region, which supported independence, a year after Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but which pro-secession Catalans celebrated.
Voters voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence, although voting activity was low because voters who opposed the vote largely ignored it.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to block voting in front of polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence supporters had spent the night outside polling stations on Friday night to avoid protests in support of the national police.
The demonstrations did happen, but you had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the secessionist demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia as an independent country.
Last year was one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents cry for joy over the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck", she said.
Despite the important but small regional elections held in December last year, it has been difficult for the Catalan independence-supporting parties to maintain their record this year, as a number of prominent leaders have either gone into exile or are being held and awaiting trial for their part in holding a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records a police protest with her cell phone, said the riot had fueled politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced he would contest next year's European elections.
Candidating for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government,he said.
A man was arrested for driving into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building.
Also, the car could have been fired at some point on a vibuno.
A punch to Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga, the first goalkeeper for Livingston, has returned victory.
The promoted Livingston racked up Rangers to take Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games, during which the man has been manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's blow proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian by a second.
Gerrard will be undefeated in the Premier League this season and will face the Hearts next Sunday, eight points down.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euroleague.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his unbeaten streak to seven games, while head coach Holt still felt a taste of loss since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston is losing his chance against the witch hunters.
The Holts should have led the team long before they hit the gate, since their straightforward playing style caused Ranger all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts stalled at the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to catch Craig Halkett's lead over the gate.
The hosts calmly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for the guests in certain places.
And that's also how you knock on the door.
The Rangers gave up the free-throw line, and Livingston got a chance to play the scheme with Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and made it through the penalty area.
By then, the Rangers were mostly in possession of the ball, but couldn't penetrate the defense, so Liam Kelly was mostly calm on the defensive end.
The same pattern continued on the other half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend the gate.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor repelled Scott Pittman's blow and Lithgow excelled in Livingston's next team.
The strikes continued to reach Livingston's penalty area and were repeatedly fired from there, and two punishments were also issued, one for attempting to replace Halkett Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
A phenomenal achievement by Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaron Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Every player was great, exceeding the expectations by moving up the board completely.
Their playing style and players have barely changed since returning to the top, but Holt must be respected for how he has punished the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, organizing a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the back of the line throughout the game.
But the Rangers were running out of motivation.
Despite their intermediate good standing under Gerard's leadership, this was a small one, according to the examples here.
Their last ball was inadequate: reaching home-field only once, which could have been a distraction for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
The controversial reception of Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, Berlin was filled with both smiles and concerns as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been excluded on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police cited security, forbidding a 25,000-member crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but a crowd of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of people who expressed opposition to Erdogan, many of whom are Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German government to host the Turkish president in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show a divided attitude toward the visitor: some Turks in Germany greet him as a hero, while others despise the man as a self-governing ruler.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: bicycle fatality from a car crash
A bicycle crashed into a car in London.
The collision occurred on a highway near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, a suburb of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
The driver stopped and the paramedics arrived to help, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred a few months after another bicycle was killed in a crash about two kilometers from the Childers Street accident on Saturday, when the hit-and-run driver fled the scene.
London police said authorities were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Traffic is closed and buses have been diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officers injured in riots
The prison authorities said six prison officials were injured in the riots at the high-security men's prison.
Reassurance rested at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at 9.30am British Summer Time and is not yet over.
The United Nations has called on the United Nations to "make a peaceful transition" to the Middle East.
The prison officials were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "External training prison staff have been called to solve the ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Five members of the team were treated for injuries.
We cannot tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be turned over to the police and their prison sentences may be extended.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was taken to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
But in October last year, the Muruli police were called to the prison to quell the serious riots that resulted in the use of billiard bullets by prison officials.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to hit Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (for areas of high intensity, the hurricane may be beneficial)
Tropical low-pressure conditions do not often affect Arizona, but they are likely to occur early next week as a mild hurricane, Rosa, moves across the deserts of the northern United States, bringing with it the threat of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already conducted flood monitoring on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, California and southern Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area with heavy rains on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service reported that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure level within a radius of 321.86 miles [321.86 km] of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed about 40 miles (64.37 km) from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall of 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters, which can reach up to 15.24 centimeters in the restricted areas of Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other desert areas of the eastern United States, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfall is likely to be between 2.54 and 5.08 centimeters, with limited areas reaching up to 10.16 centimeters.
The sudden flooding of the hardy areas can be a blessing as the area struggles with drought.
While flooding is very worrying, such rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as South America is prone to drought.
According to the U.S. Drylands Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona is in extreme, or second-largest category, drought, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa Baja is sweeping through the California peninsula in the Mexican mainland.
Rosa, which was still hurricane-level on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 6.43 miles per hour, is now 619,95 miles (619 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19.31 miles per hour.
The storm is coming into contact with the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean, and it's waving a little.
So Rosa is expected to reach the Mexican mainland with a strong tropical storm on Monday afternoon or late in the evening.
The amount of rainfall in certain areas of Mexico can be high, posing a significant risk of flooding.
From California to the Sonoran lowlands, rainfall can be expected to reach a total of 7.62 to 15.24 centimetres, sometimes reaching up to 25.4 centimetres, weather.com reported.
Rosa then moves northward through the tropical storm Mexico, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low-pressure area that moves across Arizona and reaches southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main threat to Rosale or its aftermath is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northern Sonora and the southern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains can cause life-threatening flash floods and flooding in the desert and landscapes in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests in connection with murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy with a hamstring injury was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 4:00 a.m. British summer time.
Victim was taken to hospital in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have a recording of the incident on their cell phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "deceased the Democratic Party with rage and anger".
"Supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the Democratic Party's ruthless and unacceptable tactics", Trump said in his speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "confirmed" his candidacy during the Democratic nomination process under the fierce anger of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, sharply and emotionally rejecting the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that a man attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The President said Saturday that America saw Kavanaugh's glory, quality and courage that day.
The vote to nominate Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to nominate one of the most respected legal scholars of our time with an impeccable record in public service", he told a crowd backed by West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment, while also discussing the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to go before one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running, he said.
That's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed the Democrats were on a mission to oppose and prevent.
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, the senior aide to the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Thousands killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many were displaced when waves of lightning struck the coast after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu City on Friday when a six-meter [60-foot] wave hit the beach, killing many people and destroying everything that remained.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach, not running away immediately, thus becoming victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but it took cars, wages and houses with it, wiping everything off the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h in the open sea before reaching shore.
Some people ran down the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 center.
The disaster relief air photos showed destroyed buildings and shops, broken and crumbling bridges, and water-filled mosques.
The coastal city continued to follow on Saturday.
The region of 2.4 million people was experiencing a wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than that of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb dropped during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located on the shores of the Bay of Pigs and Goats, may have increased the tsunami's intensity, the BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as extensive and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found crumbled beneath the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater than that of the Donggala coastal area 300 km north of Palus, which was closer to the center of the earthquake.
The reports from Donggala are completely false and contain no information, said Nugroho.
The area has over 300 000 inhabitants, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the places where they have suffered.
"It's already a tragedy that could get worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami in Palu city, although authorities said the waves reached the shore at the same time as the warning was issued.
Amateur images on social media show a man on the top floor of a building warning people on a panicked street about an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the shore, carrying houses and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages, which prevented communication in the Palu region and made it difficult for authorities to organize rescue operations.
The military has begun sending transport planes to Jakarta and other cities to help, authorities said, but the evacuees are still desperately in need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue work, remaining closed for the rest of the year until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
This is very bad.
While World Vision personnel from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where they were sheltered in the presentation booths in their office yard, they saw devastating images en route, Mr. Doseba said.
"They said you saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
While the relief forces began their disaster relief efforts vigorously, some complained that experienced staff from foreign aid organisations were prevented from travelling to Palus.
According to Indonesian rules, funds, supplies and relief forces from abroad may only be sent if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
It continues to be a provincial disaster, said Aulia Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
If the government says, Okay, this is a national disaster,we can start accepting international aid, but that has not yet been announced.
When the second night arrived in Palus after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of the missing were still filled with hope that their loved ones would be relieved of the tragedy of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled from the sewer ship on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national figure skating team, trained two missing figure skimmers for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest of the people trapped at Roa Roa are his students, Mr. Mandag added.
"As a senior glider skater, I have a personal responsibility", he said.
Mr Gendon spoke about how after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread among the skiing community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors of Palu at the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray bird instead of two blue birds.
"I think that means the messages didn't get there", he said.
The thieves took away 23,585.88 euros while filling a bank ATM in Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, thieves stole 23,585.88 euros from a Brink employee who was working on the Newport on the Lewes ATM, the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM at the entertainment center and was about to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While the man was in action, another man ran behind the back of a Brink worker and stole a delivery bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, the press release said, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information on theft is invited to contact the Newport Police by calling (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper is taking his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, a man tweeted about the change: "Former Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and he also used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change takes place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where the man is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grandet, who canceled her concert in the hours, the author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the man's current stage name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious significance to him.
I think ye is one of the most commonly used words in the Bible, meaning sina, West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, they are us.
I changed my name from Kany, which means "one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
Kanye West isn't the only rapper who's ever played under his own name.
Sean Combs is known primarily as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, formerly of West, has also used its name with and without a mindset, big and small.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
As the nation approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to control Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, the military attacked a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people while left-wing student movements were marching throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly grants and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this field, said Kai-Fu Lee, a funder and artificial intelligence specialist who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after various parts of the US government made statements on artificial intelligence, although the US generally lacks an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
At the same time, China last year announced its plan to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US and we are working towards the next breakthrough in AI,' said Lee.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement will be in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that won America's Best Othello Player, and later served as a member of the Microsoft Research Board and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee acknowledged a previous U.S. government technology competition like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be to help identify the next dreamers.
"US scientists have to work hard to get government funding", Lee said.
"China is not the one taking over the educators, it's the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired some brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could help support U.S. efforts to develop artificial intelligence.
I think that people who have earned a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically given a green card,the man said.
The State Council of China published the next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners from both industry and education, but the White House announced the creation of a select committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced it had started funding a $2 million initiative called AI Next.
But the National Science Foundation is currently funding over $100 million a year for AI-related research.
At the same time, the US legislation designed to create an artificial intelligence national security commission has not been amended.
Macedonians vote on changing the country's name in a referendum
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece over Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim to that territory and has denied Macedonia accession to NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries agreed in June on a new name for Macedonia, but nationalist opponents claim that the name would damage the national identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and the disregard campaign has raised doubts about whether voting activity would reach the 50% turnout required for the referendum.
The referendum will ask: Do you support Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU, in accordance with the agreement with Greece?
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protective hand of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have said they are following the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority of the Parliament.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Ghos Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in a referendum on the name change of the country to allow them to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage, raising tents in front of those who disregard the referendum.
"We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join up, not through the servants' door", said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonians, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and get EuropeanAsian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investment to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will support the name change, as over 80% of the citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership", Zaev said after voting.
He said that the word "yes" would be the affirmation of our future.
The results of a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies revealed that 3043 percent of voters, below the required voting age, are expected to participate in the referendum.
A survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said yes.
The success rate of a referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The collapse of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government's Western policies since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through all of Brighton's defenses for the gate.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through the defence of Brighton, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the impression that the goal he hit in the 65th minute of the game came off ridiculously easily.
The Argentine striker came through the middle of the line.
He broke through three of Brighton's defenders before he got out.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players on the border of Brighton penalty area.
Then he hit the ball to his left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first kick to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right half hit.
"Aguer has foot problems", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We said he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he knocked on the door at that moment.
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the Premier League.
The gate was knocked on the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly on the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball out of the air to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane got the ball a couple times before he led Sterling away.
Sky Blues hit the ball back into the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the RheinNeckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play cheerleader against the Rockies.
When the Nationals missed the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to start over.
But the uncompetitive Scherzer hopes to land the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game, still have hope of making the playoffs.
The Rockies guaranteed at least a spot on the roster with a 52 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure their first division status.
Although we're not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing with an audience here and a second team in the Denver atmosphere is probably at a higher level than any other game I can expect this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete here?
The Nationals haven't named a starter yet, but they're supposed to be on Scherzer's side in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th feeding, did a warm-up dance on Thursday and would eat as usual on Sunday.
This right-handed Washington running back leads 187, his ERA is 2.53, his strikeout numbers are 300 and his 220 2/3 chances are good this season.
Trump is giving a speech in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while also mentioning the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
This is a big event where I am not running, but I am actually running, so I am everywhere to fight for great candidates, he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, extremely horrible group of Democrats.
And they've decided to take back power by whatever means they can.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to ride over for power and control, all they want is power and control over everything, and we won't give it to them.
The Democrats are on a mission, he says, to oppose and prevent.
"And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "enraged, evil, unyielding and false".
He referred by name to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was shouting loudly in the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait  it was one of the worst body language examples, actually the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a major party.
It's intolerable for those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to condemn me, it wasn't much of a surprise.
After all, I am the last member of the Labour parliament to be told you're not welcome, and all for expressing my opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she was a strong advocate of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the jury found me guilty of not consulting with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are oddly similar to the issues Jeremy had been at odds with his previous leaders about.
The Nottingham East Labour Party's statement said that it wanted the meetings to be inclusive and creative.
For the most part, my eight years as a local Labour MP has been experiencing Friday night general assembly meetings just like that.
Unfortunately, as it stands today, this is no longer the case at most meetings, and the promise of being more generous and kind in politics has long been forgotten than ever before.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not acceptable in the Labour Party and that for each opinion, an assessment is made of who is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started right after Jeremy took over, and a colleague I thought I shared similar political views with now expected me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would never have otherwise agreed with, whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I go public, no matter what I say, there's this sentence on social media, encouraging my recall, disregarding party policy and saying I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and determination of those coworkers who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy area is how abuse levels have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so close together and with every "non-partisan" initiative or change in the electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, talk less, and then everything would be fine.
But that's not what I came into politics for.
Since joining the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, motivated by Thatcher's government's negligence that had left my high school classroom on the brink of literally collapse, I have sought to speak out for better public services to those who need it most, serving as both a local councillor and government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
There is no way anyone in Nottingham East was confused about my political views or issues of disagreement with local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I want to say that as the country moves towards Brexit, which is damaging our homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to spend my time and energy being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, it's not the only message I have for the Nottingham Moment, but for my supporters, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from acting in the interests of what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 3817 Melrose: undefeated Ayr is on top
Two late events may have slightly tipped the score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves a win in this marvelously fun first game of the Tenne League.
They're now the only undefeated team out of 10 in the top 10.
Finally, it was the team's superior defense and better risk-taking that led to the home team winning and coach Peter Murchiel has every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested all the time in the games and we're still undefeated, so of course I'm happy", he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose said, "I'm talking about Ayr, they used their chances better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute test, which was taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but the golden card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was handed over to the Warriors, gave Melros a chance where Jason Baggot did the failed test.
Climo increased Ayri's progress with a penalty kick just before the end of the half, reaching a single-half standings finish in favour of Ayri at 175.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which took over from Baggot, narrowed the gap by five points.
The game was then delayed by a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which led to the man being taken off the field, and Ayr's progress was further enhanced by the trial of Stafford McDowall, who was passed over by Climo.
Air Chief Blair Macpherson was in the yellow card at the time, but again paid for the failed transfer of Melrose's Bruce Colvine's test after heavy pressure.
However, the home-field team regained strength and when Struan Hutchinson was awarded a yellow card for blocking Climo without the ball on the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball behind the advancing Ayres.
Climo passed the ball, as he did almost immediately after the game was over, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's boxing bat and sent the quarterback Gregor Henry out on the home court in the team's fifth Test.
Still Game's star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star Ford Kieran seems poised to step into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named director of a reputable restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC television series he writes and stars alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series and it looks like Kiernan is making a living after Craig Lang's new plans.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source in Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to join the Glasgow restaurant business.
The sea is ours: Bolivia without sea borders hopes the court will open up the way to the Pacific Ocean again
The Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean-based flags flying over the buildings of the Office.
The slogan for the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is: "The sea is our right".
It is our duty to restore it.
In a landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive.
These expectations are sometimes the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has a spirit of pride, unity and peace and the country naturally expects a promising outcome, said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A large number of Bolivians across the country are watching the International Court of Justice's ruling on the big screens, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia, which, after decades of dispute, will force Chile to negotiate with Bolivia to give the latter an independent route to the sea.
The charismatic native Bolivian President Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, is under great pressure with Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he swore in late August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court is unlikely to vote in favor of Bolivia, or if so, that would change very little.
The United Nations Office in the Netherlands has no power to cede the territory of Chile and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court's decision will be handed down only six months after the final statements are heard suggests that this was not a "special case", said Paz Zárate, an international law expert in Chile.
And, by moving away from the additional causes of Bolivia, the last four years may have worsened the situation.
The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian authorities, said Zárate.
The moral warfare has lost all goodwill to the rest of Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile are still negotiating at some point, but after all this, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily urgent.
Monday will give Bolivia a chance to re-start a new era in relations with Chile and to end 139 years of divisions for mutual benefit, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most prominent presidents, uses the sea issue as a political expression.
Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
Sleep is a chance to see that we have to get over the past.
North Korea said that nuclear weapons would not be released until the country can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never give up nuclear weapons first if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the pledges made by the competing leaders at the Singapore summit.
He comments on the matter as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost appears to be resuming a deadly nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said the air strikes were a result of the US continuing restrictions and the refusal to declare an end to the war with North Korea.
Washington will be cautious about such a statement unless Pyongyang takes the first major steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously planning to abandon its weapons, which the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on another Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' fashion scene brings a series of massive headgear to the viewer, brought to the shoppers on the shopping streets of their neighborhood
If you want to increase your cyber collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of bizarre superficial headgear to the stage for their 2019 summer season, which blinded the Paris fashion scene.
High and impractical cribs are in fashion this summer via Instagram, and these designers have sent their high-end creations to fashion.
Valentino's masterpiece was a oversized beech cobra covering the heads of the models, adorned with a reminiscent wide edge.
Other high-end items included jewelry-built scarves, a magic cobra, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing so just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks had a tight mouth, so they were more like Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One piece of the design resembled a diving suit with a pair of windshields and glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the giant seaweed raids, you're lucky.
Moegurts predict that the high-rise may reach the shopping streets near you.
The supersized cyberspace is coming right up the slope of La Bomba, a 60-centimeter-wide shoulder crab seen in the minds of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowsk.
The cult brand, which created a highly unprofessional fiber spread on social media, sent another large piece of  shoulder-length beach bag to the fashion industry, almost as big as the bikini model that wears it.
The orange-tune raffle bag with raffle strips and white leather was a highlight of the 2019 summer collection of the Paris fashion house Jacquemuse La Riviera.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing big candy bars and beach bags on shopping streets next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the forefront of academic excellence and continued to do so in 2018 with the following outstanding results, reinforced by personal and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community enterprises.
These schools, which have a total of over 30,000 pupils across Scotland and are represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and their parents.
The aim of private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a context-appropriate curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
When you speak to him in his mother tongue, it reaches his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's exams show that the top of the tables are the languages with the highest pass rates among private schools.
Overall, 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language scored high A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received A's in Mandarin, 72 percent of German, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign language as a vital life skill, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages now included in the curriculum of private and other schools are similar to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17% of respondents cited a lack of language skills as one of the reasons why employers find it difficult to find employees for vacant jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future jobs.
As more promising job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a world that is on the rise.
Regardless of your career background, learning a second language can be a real advantage for you in the future, as language skills are life-long.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign nationals gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
A 2013 survey of more than 4,000 UK adults by YouGov revealed that 75 percent of respondents spoke no foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it.
Therefore, funding for language learning is essential for today's children.
Knowing multiple languages, especially in developing economies, gives children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in every school.
The bulk of schools focus on classical modern languages, while other schools teach a language considered to be the most important in the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interests, private schools always have the option of choosing between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing an environment that prepares children and equipps them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
It is no longer a question of denying that languages are vital for the future of the country in a globally developing business environment and must therefore be reflected in education.
It is precisely modern languages that should really be considered an international communication skill.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots a choice, diversity and excellence.
It's going to be a good one.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
I mean, you fanatics don't have to wait any longer to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But the number of minutes he's playing is yet to be determined.
"It's over one and under 48," Walton Lakers official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has been hinting that James is likely playing a counted number of minutes.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to warm up", he said.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, his YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five campaign events Trump plans to hold next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote is pending until Trump chooses who to appoint to the Supreme Court's vacant seat, he is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans threaten to lose control of Congress following the November vote.
What time is Trump's campaign event tonight in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday evening, September 29, 2018 at 7:00 PM Eastern Time.
The campaign of Trump in West Virginia can be viewed online via a YouTube streaming service.
Presumably, Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, is speaking about this week's hearings that have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate has suspended its confirmation vote for a week until the FBI investigates the case.
But the main purpose of the campaign is to help the new party gather power among Republicans facing the difficult November election.
So President Trump's campaign manager said that the five events next week are meant to draw volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their Senate and House majority, Reuters reported.
"Controlling Congress is so important to the president's agenda that Trump is driving fast into as many states as possible during the campaign season", a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters, who declined to be named.
Tonight's campaign event, which is scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could bring in supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage in Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reported.
This Saturday marks the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morrissey, who is running the Democratic Party's presidential primaries based on polls.
"For Morrissey, it's not a good sign that the president has come to encourage his results", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is nervous about the competition, keeping hopes high ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, the games on Saturday afternoon were sometimes just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swing swing swing is a completely fictitious concept in sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
So, where do they think the turning point is now?
"They led by six points, which has now become four, so I think I can call it a small-scale tipping point", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, which is clear, because they lead by four points and there are 12 points left in the game.
Speeth says Americans feel they don't have enough wind to sail, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially the face of Speeth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has been a footballer for both the tee and the green and sets an example.
Those victory calls from the throat became louder with each round, eclipsing the decisive podium that would have led to a fourth-place finish after he and Thomas were down two.
His pitch, which won the game on the 15th, sent a similar outcry that showed the man's faith that the Americans were not out of the race yet.
"You just have to focus more and worry about your game", Spieth said.
It's the only thing the players can do.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are the undisputed stars of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's weird but beloved couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
Mollywood was the only couple not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back at nine on Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into and out of the noisy crowd reinforces the belief that the players they compete with on Sunday, and that when the sun rises over Le Golf National, there is no player as famous as Fleetwood or Molinari to claim a European victory.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
Yet, the stories of the glory of Europe are unprecedented.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two doubles in the first nine dug a Spanish and a Swedish hole so deep they had no hope of digging themselves out.
But Saturday, there's no one to help you out of the pit.
Four-ball and pair games are extremely thrilling to watch from the very bottom of the string, just the communication between couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't get, and the way things can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team and has set a strong lead for the last day, but this four-man session showed that the U.S. team is struggling with nerves that some, especially Americans, have doubted.
Europe will be in the lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, with the United States leading 106 in the Saturday match-up between the four-ball and pair games.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two wins to Tiger Woods in a hard-fought game to lift their previous record at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorne's European side, who played to keep the losing team at Hazeltine two years ago, won the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the pair game, winning two games, but they failed to fill the gap.
Jim Fury needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the pack.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, and together with Molinard, who are nicknamed Molliwood after the weekend, they are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win their fourth Open Four.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American pioneer Bryson Dechambeauville more decisively: 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed a chance glow, but has now lost 29 of his four-ball and 19 of his two-ball games, seven straight.
Justin Rose, who had been out for the morning four-ball, returned to the match with partner Henrik Stenson, defeating 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third in the world.
In Europe, it failed, although the competition was held in a pleasant and windy climate south of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record for points by two on Saturday.
They won the four-ball final 2-1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, then returned later, and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3 in a doubleheader, losing the opening two games.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have the team come back from a four-point deficit to the individual games, although as owner Fury needs only a wick to keep half the pack.
Although they've been in second place for two days, after Sunday's counterattack, they seem to be failing.
North Korea says that under no circumstances will they unilaterally disarm themselves due to a lack of trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued restrictions had deepened its distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally relinquish its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual meeting that North Korea had taken significant benevolent measures over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site and promising not to deploy nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the United States responding to that", he said.
Without the US' confidence, our country has no security and under these circumstances we have not agreed in any way to unilaterally become the first to be armed.
While Ri reiterated the North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "processed" nuclear-free approach that would reward North Korea for its gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject a unilateral nuclear disarmament withdrawal, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump on June 12 at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore, when Kim promised to move toward the "disarmament of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease the stringent international restrictions on North Korea.
The United States is calling for the "abandonment of nuclear weapons" and is increasing the pressure on sanctions to achieve their goal by force, even against the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
The idea that restrictions are pushing us to our knees is a dream for people who don't know us at all.
But the problem is that continued restrictions are deepening our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for Kim and Trump's second summit, which the US head of state stressed earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: If South Korea were a party to the nuclear disarmament issue, not the United States, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this level of ambiguity.
However, Ri's speech was sharply different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile attack on the US continent was inevitable after President Trump named Kim a suicide bomber on a missile mission.
Last year, Trump praised Kim's courage to take steps toward disarmament at the UN, threatening to destroy North Korea altogether, but added that there was still much to do and that the restrictions would remain in place until North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons.
On Tuesday, Trump said he didn't have a schedule for it, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: The Security Council's enforcement of the restrictions must continue vigorously and unabatedly until we can fully and definitively affirm the abolition of nuclear weapons.
The Security Council has, since 2006, unanimously increased the restrictions on North Korea in an attempt to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met outside the UN General Assembly in Riga and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although his last trip did not go very well.
After a meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him in just a few hours after the gangster-like demands.
North Korea agreed at its meeting with Moon this month to destroy its missiles and nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate action.
He said Kim had told him that the "responsive measures" meant Trump's move toward normalizing security guarantees in Singapore and relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning how to get enough rest.
This year, Harvard University is offering a new course where students need to get more sleep to combat a growing aggressive culture of caffeine-rich nightmares.
Students who love academics at the best universities in the world have often been helped with the basics of self-care.
According to the course's creator, a Harvard Medical School sleep specialist and Brigham and Women's Hospital specialist, Professor Charles Chesler, it's the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about how sleep disorders affect learning.
At the end of that, a girl came up to me and asked, Why is this still being told to me now, my senior year?
He said no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - it made me sick", she explained to the Telegraph.
The course, which first entered this year's curriculum, explains to students how good sleeping habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry and director of health at Harvard Medical School, said the university decided to take the course after finding that students were seriously sleep deprived during the work week.
The hour-long course involves a number of challenging tasks.
One section shows a picture of the community, where students can tap on coffee tables, curtains, sports boxes, and books, and explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects sports outcomes, and the importance of improved sleep habits.
In the second part, participants will be taught how prolonged insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university city with its counter-cultural symbols encourages participants to reflect on their everyday routine.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the night marathons are still a source of pride, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough quality sleep should be a student's weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety,he added.It even helps to prevent weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, making a person constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler create the course by attending one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to help create a college-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all graduate students to go through a similar curriculum before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock to both go to bed and wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light produced by electronic screens and LEDs, as it could affect their daytime rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga Gate is defeated by Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor reception as a Dolly Menga strike sent by Steven Gerrard led to a 1-0 win over Livingston.
Ibrox were hoping to get their first win since February, when they were beaten 4-1 by St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as captain, falling eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga hit his gate seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' poor readiness couldn 't recover .
So Rangers are down to sixth place, Livingston is up to third place, leaving Hibernian with only one goal.
For the Rangers, the problems may not be over yet, because their attacker Calum Spence needed treatment for a head wound after he was hit with an apparently stolen object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side, which led to Ayr and Betfred Cup reaching the semi-finals.
But at the same time, Holt was moving on to the same Levi 11, who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been happy to see his well-trained boys choke off their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers might have been vastly more dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have knocked on the gate at the second opening minute when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the quarterback didn't take his chance.
The deep Keaghan Jacobs' release was followed by Captain Craig Halkett's, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-body kick in the rear post.
The Rangers were in control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the final third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute, but Judge Steven Thomson did not approve the Columbia player's complaint.
The Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned about the headline attack by Lassana Coulibaly or the Ovie Ejaria incident.
Although Livy's 34th-minute performance may have violated the rules, no one can deny that they deserved it purely because of their performances.
Again, the Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deeply difficult performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga, who simply carried the plan to its conclusion.
Gerrard was acting in the offseason, trading Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, which almost paid off when the outfielder broke up with Morello, but the impressive Kelly eaten to stop him.
But Livingston continued to lure guests into playing the exact kind of game that suits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up a long ball.
The Holt side could have advanced to the final, but McGregor stood firm, stopping Jacobs before Lithgow hit the corner of a great arc.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again applied for a penalty kick for going on a date with Jacob, which Thomson again failed to satisfy.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today, 136 years ago and on the LONDON... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From the beginning of this science, Geiger's list also became a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Coronado Clocks, which starred the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that?
Rogers: This is the Geiger number used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
These earphones can be used to hear the sound of atoms separated from the radioactivity of minerals.
Don't tell me, it's just going to be a little bit more fun!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach immune system traitors
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to kill traitor cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize traitor cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and transforming them into a laboratory.
Then they can make a common protein for many cancers and they're injected back into the bloodstream.
The vaccine in the study shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her to identify traitor cells to the immune system lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, which are modified in the laboratory to produce a protein known as  which has spread to different cancers of HER2 and then injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2  drives the growth of many cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where patients are taken from immune cells and taught to target cancer cells, has been used to treat certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West started with a tribe backed by Trump, wearing the MAGA hat on SNL's live show.
It didn't go very well.
You can watch Saturday Night Live in retaliation for Kanye West's outrageous outrage over his confusing speech praising US President Donald Trump and announcing his candidacy for the same office in 2020.
After the night of his third song, Ghost Town, where he wore a hat with the letter Make America Great, he started yelling at Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've talked to so many white people who ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was so worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", she said.
SNL started the set with Matt Damon, where Hollywood celebrity joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show never aired, West's noisy scenes were uploaded to comedian Chris Rock's social media.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with the mail.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes with his hat.
They made fun of me on stage.
They said I wouldn't go there with a hat on.
They made fun of me!
And then they say I'm drowned in the place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the drowned place? I'm wearing my Superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments caused outrage from viewers on at least two occasions and seemed embarrassing to the SNL team.
West was on the show at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande because her singer ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the song "I Love" which, at the time of its performance, looked like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who chanted: "To a brave soul:
But host Karen Hunter whispered that West was just "seeing who he is, and that's absolutely amazing".
But I decided NOT to reward (by putting on my music or clothes or supporting her art) someone who I believe believes in and spreads a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Like us, he added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now Kanye West.
She is not the first singer to change her stage name, following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion and of course, the recently deceased music legend Prince, who has turned his name into a symbol.
Charge of murder in connection with the stabbing of a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution is reviewing the case.
The Game of Thrones celebrity Kit Harington does not approve of any male-dominated game.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor (31) dismisses the aggressive hero stereotype, saying that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought something had gone wrong and raised the question of how to address the issue of gender inequality in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that she feels strongly that this issue needs attention.
"I feel pretty strongly now that we've gone somewhere wrong with masculinity", he said.
What have we taught men as they grow up about the problem we see now?
Kit believes that the rise in the male sexuality of the show is partly due to television, which is showing supernatural characters.
He continued, "What is reincarnation and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets makes young boys feel that they must be exactly what they want to be if they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young men.
In an interview, he also admitted that after the series ended next summer, he would never participate in any of the games, saying he was on the same side as the battlefields and horses of the game.
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard has been involved in the revival of True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his kidnapped brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose as the best thing to do in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so it gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
Rose played Ygritte in the Emmy-winning fantasy series, the beloved Jon Snow of the Kit character.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has jumped to 14%.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people suffer from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40 000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been sex, making it a thing of the past.
Originally , HIV spread to some parts of China through infected blood transfusions .
But the number of people infected with HIV had decreased to almost zero in this way, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is allegedly high.
Because of the country's age-old values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transmission of disease is due to the inadequate sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed universal access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the employee leaked GOP senator data, saying it was "dangerous falsehoods" and "requirements for theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that her employee posted the personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims were being spread by ultra-right-wing trolls and their websites.
False, false and even more despicable lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The information reported allegedly contained the addresses and telephone numbers of the homes of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, North Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing over allegations of sexual assault against state court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the mail was linked to the Watersea office and provided the details of a member of the Watersea staff, Hill said.
This unfounded claim is complete and utterly false, Waters continued.
My employees whose identity, personal data and safety are threatened by their fraudulent and false claims shall not be held liable in any way for this information.
This unfounded claim is a complete and irrefutable falsehood.
The statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial is the result of anger,' wrote Fleischer.
That suggests he has a hearing aid that's not appropriate for a congressman.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They can't be defiant.
They must not question the accuser's motives.
They need to stay calm.
Fleischer compared the reaction of Waters to a criticism of the Democrats for Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for the seat of Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's the truth, he whispered.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims.
We will do everything we can to find out who the perpetrators are,he continued,and to hold them legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.
Johnny English Strikes Again - a spoof of under-served Rowan Atkins
It is now a common practice to look for the meaning of Brexit in all new British films, and this seems particularly appropriate for the Johnny English parody comedy series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was followed in 2011 by the revival of Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a humorous self-deprecating joke about how obviously stupid we are about the country's new export option?
In any case, the double-eyed incompetent Johnny English has been given permission to do things his own way again - and that this broad comedy is intended for non-English-speaking film troupes.
Of course, he's a secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to smuggle, reminds me a little bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a little bit of the actor who set the tone for the Chariots of Fire logo at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It's also based on the character of a traveler and the international mystery Atkinson, who was once played in the forgotten Barclayscardi commercials, leaving behind only chaos.
There's only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE movie.
I loved the way Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval iron suit, and the helicopter wings suddenly waved against his spear.
Atkins's talent for making physical comedy is shown, but the humor seems less than stellar and oddly exaggerated, especially when the real spy movies like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer self-confident comedy.
It seems that this humor is more for children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's elaborate adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkins' dark films on Beanin.
Now, it's a perpetual assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has invaded the UK's ultra-high-level spy web, exposing the identities of all British secret police, causing a major disappointment to the local agent - a regrettable minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final blow to the prime minister, who is a solemn and troubled character who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does it great as the character of Teresa-May, but there's not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisers suggest that since all active spies are at risk, he should recall someone who's retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolteacher at a proud institution, secretly teaching him how to be a secret agent: Here are a few good places where English offers a school of rock-type espionage.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency reporting and reunited with her longtime ex-partner Boughi, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain whose actress Vicki Pepperdine's talents are seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the disgraceful sites of His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, finding Olga Kurolenko's incarnation of the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously into the hands of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve all of Britain's computer problems: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their elaborate odyssey: disguising themselves as messengers, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos, delaying on board the secret Volta luxury yacht; and English tries to unleash a real orderly order as he tries to use a virtual reality master suite to explore the interior of the Volta house.
There's no brakes on this last section, but as cute and stormy as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV.
It's a bit of a middle-class thing.
And like the other Johnny English films, I was wondering, is it really not in the British film industry to give Rowan Atkins a role that is fair to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to draft a plan where the British work four days a week but they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has been considering a reversal plan that would require Britons to work four days a week, but they're paid for five days.
The Party wants the company's executives to pass on the savings made through the AI revolution to the workers, giving them one extra day off.
That way, the workers would have a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would be in line with the Party's economic action plan and thus the state intends to incline to the benefit of workers.
On Thursday, the Congress of Trade Unions approved a plan to allow workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A Labour party source told The Sunday Times: It is expected that a review of the bill will be announced before the end of the year.
This is not done overnight, but on Thursday's working week there is an effort to align the Party's approach to economic balancing to the benefit of both workers and the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a Thursday working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole is not currently supported.
A Labour spokesman said: These Thursdays are not party policy and will not be discussed.
Vice Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to clarify his view of the socialist upheavals in the economy.
McDonnell said he's decided to take power back from the leaders of the publicly traded companies and the profit makers.
The Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the online firms may not be able to recover all their shares because the Labour Party could make a 'money loss' in connection with the alleged wrongdoing.
It confirmed its plan to put employees on the company's board and to create an inclusive ownership fund to give 10% of private sector employees' equity instead of giving annual bonuses of up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking on the 60 Minutes show about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the nomination to the state court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could affect the end of Republican support for senators.
In a poll Sunday, you asked "60 Minutes" co-host Scott Pelley of Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
I said I'm going to the hearing, I said I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were dropped and asked, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, firm, and unambiguous.
Graham's voice seems to be rock-solid.
"I'm sure of my decision with Brett Kavanaugh and it could only be changed by a bomb", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how it happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone he's named has been able to confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new coming.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting an annual music event at the Global Citizen Festival, which has a huge celebrity participation and an equally impressive goal: eradicate poverty from the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Law area not only enjoying singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the event's true purpose, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by continually increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a number of tasks or volunteer activities, email a world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it's 12 years to reach their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to take action, or is it just another knock-off where people feel they're doing something important by signing a statement online or whispering?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million activities of its supporters, in an effort to achieve a number of different goals.
Accordingly, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from their activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide to date.
Some key commitments include the UK-based investor-operator partnership The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to 'learning children's full potential', by pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help the country end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 grants from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historic landmark of social injustice", Tracey Ullman, Ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5,000 activities in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the Government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutritional intervention.
In response to a KKK website asking, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: It's a long and difficult road - sometimes we fail and fail.
But as we face the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are confident of our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a few performers performing at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use naval force to block Russian energy exports.
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington could use its navy if necessary to prevent Russia from entering the energy market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has said.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it is at the call of a legitimate government, is a precursor to the exploration of new energy markets.
I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of Southern Europe,' he allegedly said.
And the official said there are ways and means to solve it.
The United States has the opportunity to ensure that, with our Navy, the lines are open and blocked if necessary, to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,' he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to participants in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation representing the voice of the US energy consumer.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
Iran and Russia's economic choice is more or less enabling and replacing fuels, he said, referring to Russia as a trick-on-the-wall whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is committed to increasing exports of natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to reject the "unbreakable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into a "Moscow prison".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is motivated by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting in Moscow in September with US Energy Minister Rick Perry.
The US attitude has been met with a backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the German Industrial Union (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third country interfering with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Union (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says a Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she's seriously considering running for president in the upcoming midterm elections.
In the Holyoke County, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his consideration of running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the first lady", she told The Hill.
I am seriously considering running for president after November 6.
Warren also made a brief assessment of President Donald Trump's actions, saying that it was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren whispered, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents do not think he should run in 2020.
According to a survey by Suffolk University's Center for Policy Research/Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" Massachusetts voters thought a senator should not run.
32% supported such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting a possible candidacy and 48% against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with the 2020 potential candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump at the meeting of Track Palin for PTSD
Track Palin, 26, spent a year recruiting after Iraq in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with assault.
"As my son goes through what he experiences when he comes back, I can connect with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with", she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called for his son's arrest to be made a living in the room and said in connection with his son and other military veterans that they would come back a little differently, they would come back as prisoners, they would come back wondering if there was enough respect for what the soldiers and pilots and all the other military have given to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was charged with domestic violence against women, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits shelter for victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a brief summit in Washington on Friday in support of the challenging policy on asylum seekers, NBC News reported.
The applicant's full name in Grace v. Sessions, a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August, has not been released.
The woman said that her accomplice and her violent gangster sons abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, with gangs and domestic violence as major issues.
The new US asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board which allowed undocumented immigrants to seek asylum from domestic violence.
In a statement on Friday, District Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy "has been violating decades of national, Union and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be settled according to the facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle, the court argued.
The lawyers also argued in a brief statement that banning immigrants from entering the US would harm the US economy, saying they were likely to become entrepreneurs and draw the necessary workforce.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide shelter to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
The asylum application is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinionSessions said in a statement on 11 June.
The purpose of shelter was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious ones - that people face every day.
Mind-blowing rescue operations in Palus, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
The situation was becoming more and more dangerous for the survivors.
"The situation is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever-stricken young son at the Palu City evacuation center.
Every minute, an ambulance arrives with new people.
There's not enough clean water.
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through the ruins and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some injured, including a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Pala Army Hospital, where patients were being treated for continued severe convulsions.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a powerful earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pressed against the wall in the relics", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger.
US ambassador accuses China of harassing us with exploitative advertising
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the US daily news about the daily benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a Chinese Daily-paid supplement in Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper, after China was accused of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war, adjusting each other's import tariffs.
The Chinese countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to catch exporters from states like Iowa because they supported Trump's Republican parties, Chinese and US experts have explained.
US Ambassador to China and former Iowa Governor, as well as China's largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an op-ed for the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote: "China has now doubled its pressure by publishing a campaign of pressure in our free press".
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's expensive free speech and free press practices to place its paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
On the other hand, the Beijing street audience has only a limited voice and does not see the genuine differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have about China's economic direction, given that the media is in the strong hands of the Chinese Communist Party,he added.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but did not say which.
Analysts warn that Republicans are expelling female voters before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh fiasco.
While many Republicans are waiting to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially against women.
The situation has been tense and most Republicans have already shown their willingness to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be taken back", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
The director expressed suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute effort to investigate the FBI's investigation was sufficient to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state representative for the progressive movement group MoveOn, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated 'November is coming!' at a rally in their Senate lobby because Republicans, who control the judges' committees, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
Democratic India and internal exports are starting to fall off the graph, informal political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news agency.
People say it's already high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters 1829 years of age who dislike the president and are often left without a vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts predicted a backlash if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
"It's become very confusing for the GOP", said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele earlier this week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the Commission's vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is to be elected, it's about how the Republicans have treated him and how they have treated him, said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, at the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be a little divided between those who believe in Ford and those who believe in Kavanaugh, but a little more in favor of the former.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents believed Ford's testimony was likely or certain, while 35% said they certainly or likely believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they believe Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford swore before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the State Court candidate showed him their gender when they attended a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet that will connect the Internet to Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, started a startup company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology alliance, Inrupt, is the company that develops the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid enables users to choose where their data is stored and to whom they are granted access to the information.
In a separate interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to rule the world.
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own personal online database, or POD.
It may contain contact lenses, task lists, calendars, music sets and other personal and competent tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of which are available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online database is that it allows the user to choose who can access that information.
The company calls this "personal authorisation through data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt's idea is to provide the sources, processes and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce Lee, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few developers hired to work on the project under contract, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team won't talk to Facebook and Google about implementing a complete change once all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
We're not asking their permission.
In a post on Saturday's Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the net's neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next age of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: a memorial to the Victorian religious figure who received the Cross during World War I
The only church in England to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann fought his badge out on 29 September 1918 in the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourte.
But he died four days later from a sniper's bullet, unaware that he had received the highest British military decoration.
His two sons and two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his sons, Michael Vann, said it would be "generalized symbolically" if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after Grandpa's award-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through a very thick foggy line of jacuzzi and snipers.
Later, he rushed to the offensive line and carried it forward with the greatest gallantry before he rushed to one gunner alone and defeated three opponents.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanne was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful".
He and his brother Dr James Vann set the world record for the parade led by the Royal Brentwood Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of this parade" and added that the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero can be appreciated.
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, but they only saw Pig Peppat.
Imagine you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, but you're not getting this key event.
The San Jose match featured 13 fights, including six card games, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom all night.
At 6am, when Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the UK audience was silent because Piggy Peppa appeared on screen.
Many were not impressed, especially those who had stayed up until the early hours to see just this struggle.
One fan described the transition to children's comics on Twitter as a "painful joke".
It is government regulation that at 6am the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the children's programme, explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
♪ I'm going to be a little bit nervous ♪
President of the Bellator Scott Coker said they planned to work on their schedule to include more UK viewers in the future.
"If I think about reintroduction now, I think we can solve this problem in the future", Coker said.
But if it's 6 a.m. on Sunday morning there, we can't do it until our Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth, and not all of it was friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government rule.
I can promise you, it won't happen next time.
We're showing five instead of six fights, as we usually do, trying to give fans more, and we just went over time.
This is a precise situation.
Tom Daley felt he was a sex worthy
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he did not realize until high school that "no one is like him".
As a guest on Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs, she said she talks about gay rights to give others hope.
Parenting also changed her attitude toward winning the Olympics, making her feel that it was no longer important.
You get the usual longtime host Kirsty Young, who had to take a couple of months off because of her illness.
On the first episode of Laverne, Daley said he felt inferior to others growing up because he was socially unacceptable when you liked boys and girls.
She said, "To this day, these feelings of being worthless and feeling different have given me the power and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was worth something, and he didn't let anyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Bronx Olympian has become a highly regarded leader of the LGBT campaign, using her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he talks about it because he's lucky he can live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - surprised her.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than her last year, but she said the age difference was never a problem.
When you've been through so much as a young person -- he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- it was hard to find someone as old as you who had experienced similar heights and gaits.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his overall outlook has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
But you know, there are a lot more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father wouldn't die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit on the bench.
I couldn't tell him that you couldn't sit on the bench because you're gone by then, he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until after he had actually stopped breathing and died that I finally admitted that he was not invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that", she said.
It also inspired her first song selection, Heather Small's Proud, which helped her prepare for the Olympics and still gives her a crush.

Mickelson was out of the lineup for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid an accidental stall.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12th time at the event every two years, was eliminated by Captain Jim Furyk for a pair of games and a four-ball tie on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner split his day in two, being enthusiastic and working on his game, hoping to make it better.
Never the most straightforward hitter, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is particularly unsuitable to play on the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long, hard course punishes the constantly missing hits.
And if the pitch itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will be on Sunday, his ninth, facing up to the accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with star Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his races this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the first 12 singles, start with a fire, Mickelson's game can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but she had little more to add.
"He fully understood his part of today, slapped me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk added.
He's very confident.
He's a celebrity, and he's given as much to our teams in the past as this week.
I probably never saw him play two games.
I saw more ahead, but it turned out that way, and we had to choose that path.
He wants to be out, like everyone else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, but it has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence has added to the team's spirit.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's smart, he likes to have fun with people and he's just great in team space", she explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week and it was great to see.
He offers much more than just a game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advance may soon be gone.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that Ryder Cup's high-ranking position on the final day of the individual games can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Danishman made his debut in the 1997 Valderram competition, where he and Captain Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but the finish line was drastically reduced, with a win of only 141⁄2: 131⁄2.
You even remember that we had a great leadership position at Valderram; we had great success at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderram, where we won, that win came very close, said Bjorn, pictured after winning the Class of 2018 5: 3 on Friday and 10: 6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you've got the points on the list.
We have a goal, which is to win the lottery, and so we're focused on that.
I've always said I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are, the best players in the world.
Pleased with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to mess things up.
Tomorrow is a whole new obstacle.
Tomorrow's personal performance, and so it's more of a different story.
It's nice to be with your opponent when things are going well, but if you're there in person, you're being tested as a full-fledged golfer.
That's the message you have to give the players, give your best tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's going to have to leave and take care of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes his players will perform better in person than with his opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last few days, being part of the Brooklyn team that won before taking part in the loss when Europe surrendered to the miracle of the Medinah.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all their money into their game on the last day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you have to start with fire, like in Brooklyn and Medina.
If the pitch goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middleweight division.
We're gonna set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel like tomorrow's a miracle.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the race and he is best facing Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best European players in the race.
"I'm putting my boys in that order because I think that's how we're properly covered", Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
The new German warship has pushed back again.
The newest fast cruiser of the German Navy was supposed to be launched in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war warships, but it will not be until the following year due to faulty systems and increased costs of snowballing, local media reported.
The launch of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fast-propelled guided missile, the Rheinland-Pfalz, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to military press releases published in Die Zeit.
The ship was to have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but the worrying post-transmission problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class fast cruisers.
Understandably, they have powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies, such as radar, infrared and audible signal reduction.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest fast-moving boats should be able to be sent out of the home port for up to two years.
However, the continued delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships - which enable Germany to strengthen its power abroad - are becoming obsolete by the time they enter service.
The failed F125 fastboat made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Vosse shipyard.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder since receiving it.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media cited several significant hardware and hardware deficiencies that rendered the warship unfit for use in combat missions.
The deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-Württemberg-class ships are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce of the older Bremen-class fast cruisers.
It was also found that the ship was significantly overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Pfalz is probably twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the team, becomes a problem.
It is said to reach EUR 3.1 billion ($ 3.6 billion) - up from the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the latest high-speed raids are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German Navy is declining in strength.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy had actually lost exposure-qualified ships.
The official said the issue has grown as a snowball over time because the old ships were removed, but no replacement ship came.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fast cruisers could join the Navy.
The National Trust is investigating the secret life of the skin mouse.
A new study in the Scottish Highlands is designed to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future protective measures.
The study, by scientists at the Scottish National Trust, tracks the common and soprano pipes, as well as the brown long-eared and Daubenton's skin mouse, in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders shall be placed in the main areas to monitor the activity of the skin mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct external surveys using handheld sensors.
A competent assessment of all records shall determine the frequency and activity of the call of the skin mouse species.
A map and report of the habitats is then created to provide a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
NTS's natural heating consultant Rob Dewar hopes the results will show which habitats are most important to the bats and how they are used by different species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as nesting and how best to preserve forest for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the population of bats has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and its loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can flying paper and the chemical processing of some building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Skin mice are not actually blind.
But because of their nighttime hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes in the prey.
They use sophisticated fish-location techniques to detect insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
NTS, which manages more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, takes leather mice very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, review, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated leather reserve in Threave, Dumfrie and Galloways, home to eight of Scotland's ten leather rat species.
Real estate manager David Thompson says this area is the perfect territory for them.
"We have a large area for skin mice in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there is much more to be discovered about mice, so the work we do here and in other areas helps us better understand what they need.
He stresses the importance of checking skin rats before starting property care, as the unintended destruction of a single birthplace and birthplace could kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
The skin rats are protected and killing, disturbing or destroying them is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer with the Mouse Protection Association, has urged the public to help.
He said, "We have so much to learn about our skin mice and we just don't know how many of our species and how their populations feed".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers plan to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied the allegations of rape against him as a "fake news", saying people "want to advertise themselves using his name".
His lawyers are going to appeal the charges to the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayor, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman's wife €330,643.10 to keep her from mentioning the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live Instagram video of his 142 million followers half an hour after the allegations, Ronaldo (33) was reported to be involved in a "fake news" incident.
No, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
"What we said today is false", the fifth Ballon d'Or winner told the news.
They want to advertise themselves by my name.
It's the usual.
They want to make a name for themselves with my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and all is well, added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to appeal to Der Spiegel's court over the "unjustifiable allegation of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player is seeking compensation for the moral damage caused, which corresponds to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayor allegedly went back to the player's hotel room, where he was allegedly raped, according to documents filed in Clark County Circuit Court in Nevada.
The mayor claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was a 99 percent good man, of whom 1 percent are good.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the couple's sexual relationship, but it was not unanimous.
He also claims that he went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he feared a fine and was worried about humiliating the public.
Now, the 34-year-old woman says she's trying to overturn the resolution now because the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had reportedly left Manchester United at the time of the attack and joined Real Madrid and this summer he moved to Italy in connection with a €100 million deal with giant Juventus.
Brexit: the EU may regret carmakers leaving forever
The UK would regret it forever if it lost its position as world leader of the car industry after Brexit, said Secretary of State for Business Greg Clark.
It added that Toyota CPC had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily suspend its production at its plant in Burnaston near Derby.
"Let's make a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of the border-crossing stoppages could lead to jobs without Brexit.
The Burnaston plant, which produces vehicles from Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our plant stop', said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal, fearing concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit deal.
The Toyota production line is operational as needed, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement reached on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border that could lead to delays and shortages of parts according to the industry.
Toyota would not be able to hold stock at its Derbyshire plant for more than one day and production would therefore have to be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May Chequerce's plan for the future of EU relations was fully calibrated to avoid such border checks.
"We want the best solution that will enable what we want and not only take advantage of the current success but also of the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence not only for Toyota but also for other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set.
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be suspended, but warned that in the longer term the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately also pay for jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a representative of the Unite union in Burnaston for 24 years, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "We know from experience that when jobs go away, they will not come back.
A government spokesperson said: We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as the fight against top-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Agent Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, the links between Trump aides and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general and thereby threatens Mueller's independence has been a source of Washington rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has not confirmed it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, announcing his intention to resign.
Instead, it was reported that he was meeting Trump on Thursday, who was then in New York at the UN.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about his meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "That date hasn't been set yet, it could be this week, but it could be pushed back another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's see, and I'll keep up with the press, as always.
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
The head of the station, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of information was not due to the deliberate disappointment of the TV journalists, but added: "I do not dispute that they are being prepared for disappointment".
Then he suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president does more Q&A sessions than any president before him, he said, adding no evidence: "We've looked at those numbers".
The news continues, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that, and you've seen how we've done it over the last couple of weeks, so it's happening during a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump answers questions regularly by leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated perhaps why, before the gathering of journalists to march out and sometimes with a strange look.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU NHS staff in Scotland about fears of Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU NHS staff in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish for their post-Brexit stay.
Ms Jeane Freeman MSP sent her letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the expenses of EU citizens working in their public service for their established status.
Freeman wrote: The summer of negotiations on the UK-EU withdrawal has continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible non-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every worker, regardless of nationality.
Staff members from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie was hit in the head by an emergency medical procedure.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has been through an emergency cut after suffering a concussion and a concussion on Saturday 31: 27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ has announced.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened just before midseason.
"He fell into the village and just collapsed", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen while he was on the ice before he was placed on the stand and taken off the field for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there was no specifics on the type/length of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Second-year redshirt Abercrombie was in his freshman season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five fights before the game on Saturday, which was 18 games this season.
Foreigners are required to pay a higher house fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher temp fee when they buy real estate in the UK using that extra money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This move undermines Corbyn's ambition to appeal to young voters.
Temporary taxes are levied on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Department hopes to create up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher rate of house tax when they buy real estate in the UK, using that extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to lure young voters into promising them affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The Temporary Tax is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, directing additional money to the government's desire to fight homelessness.
The additional fee - in addition to this template fee, including higher levels imposed two years ago for second home and forward-season purchases - may be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to generate up to £120 million a year.
In the UK, 13% of the properties purchased in London are owned by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first time buyers to get off their feet when buying a home.
Many of the country's rich regions - especially the capital - have become 'current cities' thanks to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high when they buy land but don't use it, and urged May to waive quotas for affordable homes to repair the embarrassment of Britain's living conditions.
Corbyn has announced a major housing reform including a rental control and an end to the smuggling of innocent people.
He also wants to give the legislatures more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I promised myself to be committed to restoring the British dream as Prime Minister - that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is true that individuals not living in the UK and businesses based abroad are as easy to buy homes as hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far-fetched, and harsh sleeping conditions are a common reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's leader at some point.
The Scot (42) is pleased to be challenged to revive the North East club, who are currently third in League One, just 3 points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I was in the B-class and that was limited", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportSound.
But I grew up watching with my dad in the Scottish Hampden, and it's always something that's pulled me back.
But this opportunity only comes when I'm successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid of such big names, having previously held down at both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, the only thing that's going to make it to the Champions League is to be able to lead this club.
"The club is definitely part of the Champions League because of its structure and facilities", he said.
Reaching your town is not an easy task, but I only see myself successful if I can get the club back there.
Ross has only been a manager for three years, having previously been Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months on the board of Heart.
He then helped Allo recover from a third-place fall and made St Mirren, the lowest-ranked player, the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was a real crossroads", he recalled, "to take over the Alloa".
I really thought driving was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did it, I made a decent income, and I enjoyed some highlights.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still experiencing it given the stress and pressure of my job, but management just seems more appropriate.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I do. I feel more comfortable now than I've ever felt as an adult.

The summer heat has improved pubs in Britain's trouble, but there's been a greater pressure on restaurant tickets.
The figures showed that pubs and bars increased turnover by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurants' turnover fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, representative of CGA, a business consultancy, said: "Continuing sunshine and England's longer-awaited participation in the World Cup meant that July was similar to June when pubs grew by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants got even harder.
The retail trade of restaurants, which declined by 1.8% in June, deteriorated further in July.
The pubs and bars that were the best at selling and the restaurants that liked to eat the worst.
Food-based pubs suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant lovers.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between the closed pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased 6.6 percent over the month, while food sales fell three percent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The impact of the weather and the large social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant chains continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales from the previous year is particularly painful in addition to ongoing price anxiety.
A long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food business operators and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August provide some much needed relief.
The overall sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new opening, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the branding authorities.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses performance data for 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and is a well established benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The study found that one in five children, some of them 11-year-olds, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found that Insta leaves grew
The news raised fears of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a parent-teacher account
The study found that one in five children, some of them as young as 11, created secret social media accounts that they concealed from adults.
A study of 20,000 gymnasts found a marked increase in the number of valts Insta accounts (for the Instagram page for sharing links).
The news was alarmingly high about sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a based account that was both intended to show parents and made acceptable to themselves.
One of the victims of her 13-year-old daughter's secret leak saw that the teenager was inviting others to rape her.
Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), a private school-linking organisation, found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18 year olds had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged the existence of personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's disturbing to see so many teens being lured into creating online accounts where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will become the athletic director of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as the non-executive chairman of the board at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most acclaimed lightweight champion and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for sporting leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is respected throughout Scotland, the UK and other sporting communities and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit from being invited to his leadership", said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I want to be an advocate for athletes and I hope to make a real contribution to Scotland's sport and contribute to its development.
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200-meter and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now shares his opinion frequently on the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I got a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that whether or not I recovered and if, and to what extent, would only be revealed by time.
I've worked hard, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I'm already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
Breastfeeding ads that compare women to cows divide the Internet
The breast pump company has shared two camps of advertisements online comparing a nursing mother to a leaping cow.
According to reports, to celebrate the launch of the world's first silent breast pump, consumer-focused technology company Elvie has released an ironic music video-like ad to showcase the freedom this new pump offers to mothers who want to live out their lives.
Four real mothers dancing on a table full of hay with cows and singing, "Yeah, I'm jumping, but you can't see my tail".
I'm going to pump, pump, feed the kids, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk.
But the company's Facebook ad has generated contrary opinions on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, viewers are in a different opinion, and many of them say it sheds light on the history of dairy farming.
The use of lights to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth, one wrote.
Elvie breast pump does not rub into the eyes of the breastfeeding mother (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: "Reasonably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to promote breast implants for mothers who are still having babies?"
Someone added: "A totally unhealthy ad".
Part of it's advertising, and one woman thought it was too much.
I'm finding this to be a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I still breastfed.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but let's just take it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product, wrote one.
Another commented: This is a fun ad for pumps and self-described cows (often at work or in the bathroom).
This advertisement neither praises nor condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they've all danced with unobtrusive pumps wrapped in bra.
The idea for the campaign is based on the saying that many breast-feeding women feel like cows.
But Elvie Pump is completely silent, with no wires or pipes and no eye on the breastfeeding groom, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even walk outside during the pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and exciting introduction.
By comparing women's expressions and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumps and all of their challenges, while presenting the extraordinary freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and familiar way.
This isn't the first time the news has been about Elvie's pump.
At a London fashion show, a mother of two, wearing a product of the designer Marta Jakubowski, appeared.
Thousands of migrant children quietly marched to the Texas border camp
The number of children of migrants detained has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained fairly constant, partly because the Trump administration's strict rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to get help from childcare sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are documented immigrants and they fear violating their ability to stay in their country, demanding custody of the child.
The risk increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household adults could submit fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the senior immigration and customs official, told Congress last week that the agency had arrested a dozen people who applied for financial support for non-containing minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80% of sponsors or sponsors' households are in the country illegally, and a large number of them have a criminal background.
So we're going to keep following them, Mr. Albence said.
To speed up the treatment of the children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, which officials said was 60 days after the asylum.
Many defend their legal content before an immigration judge by videoconferencing, back-to-back.
Those not fit for release shall be removed from the country promptly.
According to shelter staff and the reports published in the system in recent months, the longer the child is under surveillance, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent protests or attempted escape.
Lawyers say that these concerns are more pressing in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where the child's difficulty may be overlooked because of his size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to get used to class or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many already experience.
Syria demands the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupying forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on the UN General Assembly to welcome Syrian refugees home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Mouallem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian territory in preparation for counterterrorism and were being treated accordingly.
They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he told the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the war on terror in Syria is almost over. Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have fled their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight this holy war until we have cleared the entire Syrian region of terrorist groups and any foreign forces that are present illegally.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country since the war.
Speaking on the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were favourable and accused the unfounded fears that prevented them from arriving in the West of spreading to the West.
We have started helping the international community and humanitarian organisations to face them, he said.
They're policing something that's just a humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be provided to Syria until an agreement between Assad and the opposition ends the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create the Idlib buffer zone, the last rebel base, has opened the door for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the extensive siege of Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would kill jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters affiliated with Al-Qaeda, who would be "destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convince the new government and opposition committees to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and pave the way for elections soon.
Moualem called for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why is Trump getting re-elected for a second term?
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal have not ended his presidency earlier, as liberal viewers would presumably like.
What should be the most exciting end of the presidency?
At this point, the viewers are showing no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers per hour, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has had 3.5 million viewers on cable, keeping it high on the mainstream evening news.
This is the strain we're being put on because we don't understand it, said the head of ABC drama Designated Survivor about the government secretary who becomes president if an attack destroys parliament buildings.
Nell Scovelli, an experienced comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked.
"He said he made me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
All this chaos has entertainment value.
Unlike other television shows, though, the Washington rumors could become the fate of Roe v. Wade and reunite immigrant families and the global economy.
Staying out of the way is just a luxury for viewers in the prime.
But the six-hour expert panel discussion of Bob Woodward's thorough background research for the purpose of his book Fear and Paul Manafort's $13,225.73 dollar jackets for the leopard-haired Bomber (the Washington Post said it was a "confident dress") and Stormy Daniels' comments about Mr. Trump's anatomical complexity are more than just educated citizens.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario with the same emotion again.
"One of his activities, which may seem like a real-life series, is that he shares something every night", said Wheelhouse Entertainment CEO and series creator Brent Montgomery, with the changing cast and daytime planners of Trump's show (scoring the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't leave a split between your eyes or you're out of time.
That week, Fleiss was at his home on the North Kauai in a 80 degree heat, but he had gone into the room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't help but watch Brett Kavanaugh perform on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's fate hanging in the balance.
"I remember doing all kinds of crazy shows back in the day and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Elsewhere, cash flows are moving into the White House's most pressing midterm elections.
No wonder Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is getting cash flow thanks to a congressional reorganization, bringing two market leaders to the same location.
This led to the re-election of the representative of the Pittsburgh suburb of the Democratic Republic, Conor Lamb, who won the second district seat in the special election last spring.
Lamb's running mate is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th District, which is larger than the new 17.
The charts were amended following a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which resulted in the old districts being divided into unconstitutional constituencies, favoring the Republicans.
The recent 17th election has almost saved a campaign where the financial divisions of the largest parties - the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC) - are cheating themselves on money.
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory in the highly-attended March 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District special election.
This is a Republican case that's been going on for decades, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political establishment has given the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States punished El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which was a small setback to Washington.
Mr Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varelas in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 and owned the Panama Hotel until the partners fired Trump's company management team.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to withdraw U.S. diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had recently ceased to support Taiwan.
But only El Salvador, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic stimulus, was scheduled to be punished.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and death toll.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials pushed forward a high-level security and economic prosperity consultation to continue a similar meeting last year that was seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear they wanted to continue the meeting and end the discussion on any sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is now being criticized for speaking at a mid-October meeting to discuss government positions.
And three American ambassadors returned to the Salamis in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh warning or punishment from Washington.
A White House press secretary, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details spoken by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic discussions on a request for anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The study history
Next, it could be that Special Counsel Robert Mueller will release a report on Trump's possible misconduct, which has a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating whether Trump's campaign is connected to Russia's attack on our election.
If Congress is to change sides, Trump must report to this body as if he were to go back to talking to voters and perhaps even his fellow judges.
There are many agendas here, and I do not want to point out that the deportation of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make choices that affect the longevity of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West had stopped him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We were grumbling and unable to avoid the many years of slaughter that followed.
History is turning around such turning points and the relentless march of democracy is either getting closer or pushing forward.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What are we gonna do when Trump fires Deputy District Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the water since it was reported that he proposed a secret presidential record last year and speculated on his inability to hold that office.
Rosenstein says the Times' statement is inaccurate.
What would you do if the FBI's newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed in a federal court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections if Trump is to answer?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter break.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was transported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me a light of Sabbath candles on a table with a hawk.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, who is also the Chairman of the Washington Citizens' Association for Responsibility and Ethics and author of the book, 'The Last Palace: A Restless Europe in the Fifth Century and a Legendary Dawn of Living'.
Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the Battle of Rapid Vienna.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Australia, following their impressive win against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to secure promotion to the Europa League's G-League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season before the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to improve their performance.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went to the game, believing we could accomplish something, and we left the game with a point.
We might have achieved more, but generally, it was the right result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the people supporting us, I'm sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was tough, because of it, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good feeling.
The team's good, and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, put the past behind us and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of the fear of pension insurance
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide survey respondents said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare for caring for your family unless they know in advance what you want.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely costly.
Consult your financial advisor: Your financial advisor may have a good plan for how to cover these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value to cover these costs, or an asset self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary funds.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles in the meantime.
Take care of your health care plan to identify a trustee to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes when you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the trustee regarding your financial situation.
Choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even when you are incapacitated.
Remember these small details: Imagine that your elderly mother is in a medical emergency and on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down these things so you'll be ready if needed.
It's not just the financial side of things, but who are the doctors who matter? Martin explained.
What medicines are needed?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Put it all together.
Men were shot several times by a machine gun in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times by a machine gun while he was on his way home after spending the night out.
In the 1940s, the victim was shot in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting at about 2:30 a.m. as a random act.
Victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are asking all witnesses to contact him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll continues to rise.
Since the connection has been broken, rescuers have received no information from Donggala Regency in northern Palau, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
The request was evacuated after the disaster, more than 16,000 people.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, on the Goat Bay, and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an unexpected earthquake and tsunami.
The Donggala Regency is a region extending over 300 km (180 miles) to the north of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, concentrated mainly in Morowali, the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, tsunamis have struck Palu and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the warm Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several major earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern half of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck an area near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of Sumatra's islands, Mentawai, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding people of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The tsunami did not occur, but over 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Larger earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily confined thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with reports of domestic violence, and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a female person tried to inform the police of alleged crimes, Palin took his phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Unit and is being held on an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty of any crime", the news network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Paline has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, the police called his mother Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being considered in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault at home, interfering with domestic violence reports, and possession of a weapon, all while drunk.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from her service in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake followed by tsunami: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake that struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the outskirts of Sulawesi's downtown, just north of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Social media has been streaming videos showing the earthquake's moments.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu City.
Federal prosecutors in NYC are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack.
New York state attorneys are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare federal crime that hasn't been carried out since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to attack the cycle paths along the West Side highways in Lower Manhattan, killing both pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to the death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and caused serious bodily harm.
Both cases are based on court documents that indicate a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, federal prosecutors charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder, eight counts of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack was "considered highly planned and premeditated", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "extortion, cruelty and subversion".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and damage to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, is in the planning stages.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last death in the Southern District of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out was in a 1953 federal trial in New York City of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, where a married couple were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a fervent believer, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he was pleased with the results.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos viewed on his phone.
Police said he also wanted the ISIS flag displayed in his hospital room.
He's not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's state attorneys, said they were "clearly disappointed" in the court ruling.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty extends the trauma of all those involved", Patton said, "instead of accepting the charge without the possibility of parole and serving a life sentence".
Earlier, Saipov's defense team asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Tory MP said NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has promised to mobilize the army during the protest at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP chief said politicians needed to be aware of the "hotness of eurosceptics" because one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead the EU negotiations.
Conservative House of Commons member Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would be out by now if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May faces the problem in her deeply divided line of compromise, which was stressed by the Conservatives who supported staying, joining her anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is in trouble keeping his Chequerce plan in line amid Brexit supporters, backers and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the strike and forced Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between his package and the kaose.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to abandon the Chequer plan.
He suggested that Farage be partnered and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'We'd be out of it by now,' he said.
Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I stand for Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequer plan.
He expressed his opposition to the EU by saying: "We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The view that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.
And Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory Brexit supporter, was also on the march, and she told reporters, "I'm just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequer plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually walk the streets and actually elect us.
Please leave the Chequerce plan and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.
Farage said the politicians at the meeting should be made to feel the heat when they plan to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It's now a question of trust between us  the people  and our political class he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let that happen
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, uncomfortable.
We are mobilizing the people of the country that gave us victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
Meanwhile, the remnants marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering in the city centre.
A handful of activists have leaped out on Brexit after the group was formed this weekend.
The Liberals, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues that their party was involved in implementing when the conference opened.
These are people who say they can bring IT systems in place and all technology to Canada and even more, for smooth cross-border, unrestricted cross-border trade to Ireland,he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren of the United States has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future Saturday at a prison in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the next election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's vice chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's been speculation that he might run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday's main event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at the White House since Trump took office.
The official asked if he was planning on running for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means it's on the front lines.
LSU Sims shooting has been arrested.
LAPD in Baton Rouge announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who died Friday, has been arrested.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University town early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got a bullet from Simpson.
Simpson was interviewed and confessed to being at the scene, possession of a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6-foot-2, Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, 10 of them as a starter, averaging 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the World Championship after a team record gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment on, it became clear that Walter Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the order of the Mercedes team played a big role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start, almost leaving Hamilton in a coma when he defended his position on the first two occasions and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into the boxer's seat, leaving the back of Hamilton's group in a tight traffic jam that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the boxing circle later and followed Vettel out, but Hamilton took the lead after a sideline when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside open for passing after a third turn to try to protect it with a double-barreled move.
Max Verstappen started the race from behind the wheel and finished seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving the wings in a winding finish and overtaking Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He finally made it to the bowl on lap 44, but failed to speed up the final eight laps, giving Raikkonen a fourth-place finish.
Today is a hard day because Walter worked hard all week and was a real gentleman walking by me.
"The team has done a great job of getting one of the two", Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump charged Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting Saturday over an incident that she failed to leak a letter to Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford's testimony directly to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate at the time, which shows that people are "reckless, reckless and false".
"The only good thing that can happen and is happening right now, and has happened in the Senate in the last few days, is that you see anger and anger, and evil, and ugly, and false people", he said.
If you look at the press releases and leaks that say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Do you remember his answer to the question, did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't leak it.
- Wait a second.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak, he added with the senator's face.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July about the charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his job.
The Hill reported: "I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations or leak his story", Feinstein told the committee.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I did so.
But his denial was not appropriate for the president, who commented at the meeting on Saturday: "You know what, it was very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's one of the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually abusing three women, the president hinted that the Democrats were using those accusations for their own ends.
They have decided to take back power without choosing the means.
You see this wickedness and disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to ride to get power and leadership, the president of the media said.
The Dundee Stars 5 to 3 Belfast Giants
Giants Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars defeated the Belfast Giants in a re-match with the elite team on Saturday, losing to Dundee 5: 3.
The Giants started the game early with two gates to lead Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the sidelines before Dwyer took the Giants back.
Francois Bouchard tied Dundee's lead before the Luka Lundvald Nielsen gates secured their victory.
This was the third loss for Adam Keefe's men in the elite league, who came to Belfast on Friday night to beat Dundee 2 to 1.
It was the fourth meeting of the half-season, and the Giants won three of their last three games.
Dwyer's opening gate came in at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul and David Rutherford, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 1:10 in the first quarter before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit a 15-yard field goal.
Dwyer made sure the Giants led before the first break, hitting the second gate of his evening at the end of the first quarter.
On the home court, the players regrouped and Bouchard re-placed them, striking a numbered overtime of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee his first lead at the end of the second quarter, securing a third-place win in his team's offensive line.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
The pilot is dying to save hundreds of lives from the earthquake.
An Indonesian pilot was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on Friday struck Sulawesi and caused a tsunami that killed more than 800 people, many of whom are still missing.
The area is experiencing severe flooding and many people are trapped in the ruins of Palu City.
Despite the fact that colleagues of 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung fled the shaky air tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport, he refused to leave.
He remained at the post of work to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321 at the same time.
Then he jumped out of the air tower, thinking it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News in Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to another major city hospital.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter even reached Palus.
"We were extremely sad to hear about this.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, according to the state disaster relief agency, with access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong being restricted.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "The death toll may rise because many of the victims' bodies are still under the rubble and have not been recovered.
The 6 meter high waves have swept through the town of Palu, where massages are taking place on Sunday.
The military and airplanes provide assistance and equipment.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: "The ambulance is bringing in new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Everywhere, small businesses are being robbed.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help survivors, but we can't say what they can find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palusa on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin claims one man has been missing in a lagoon crash
While it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane, the airline operating the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now claims that one man has gone missing.
Air Niugini said in its statement that as of Saturday afternoon, they had not been able to locate a male passenger.
The airline said they're working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's details, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at Chuuki Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday but were in stable condition.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact timing of the events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon's runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American traveler, said the plane was landing at a very low altitude.
"This is very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers managed to get on a sinking plane and drift into the water until they got to the emergency room.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy and sailors who worked at a nearby dock also helped rescue by using crowded boats to take people ashore before the plane sank about 30 feet [30 m] below the water.
The Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in air crashes involving airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them were associated with Air Niugin.
Analyst's putting together a schedule for the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor's office closed a review of the case on Saturday for a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours analyzing the intelligence as an expert observer.
He told the jury how he used cell phone interception to recreate the movements of 29-year-old plaintiff Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she received location information from several cell phones that suggested that Tellis was with Chambers the night the girl died, contrary to the young man's earlier claims.
When the records showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so he went to the police to speak to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom Saturday and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before the girl died.
Phone records showed the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett claimed that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped the girl out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to hear his case on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks the case will go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to fight negative genre determinism by adding positive messages to their music.
The High Breed, based in Bristol, claims hip-hop has moved away from the beginnings of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York nanny sues a couple for a racist message
A New York nanny is suing for discriminatory dismissal after a couple accidentally received a message from a family member complaining that the nanny is "another black woman".
The couple denies they're racist, compared to extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her anger when she learned that their new delivery service provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband a message saying, "To you, the next black woman".
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman fired a discomfort after his misunderstanding of Miss Maurice's misconduct, claiming that their social caregiver, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had waited for a Filipino to replace him.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple in court to get the compensation for dismissal he wants to receive for $350 a day for the next six months, and the same job he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them to look, so do", he told The Post, adding: "I know it's discrimination.
The couple rejected the claim that they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to terminate their employment with Maurice because they feared that after the girl was insulted, they could no longer trust her.
My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
"We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
But would you let your children be held by someone you have been rude to, even if it was unintentional?
- My newborn?
All right, here we go.
Commenting on the comparison to the blackmail, Plasco said his wife was two months away from giving birth and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you go up against someone like that?
That's not very nice, the investment banker added.
While the case is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned a couple on social media, where they are harshly criticized for their behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington's editors feared that readers would not be able to relate to the talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, wrote: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it is published.
It's so much fun to know what we know about Paddington's great success.
He said that his father, inspired to write a children's book about a small toy ranch, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about his job being rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a hazelnut-shaped death of his father last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as a "very important member of our family", he added that his father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man and not a proud man", he said.
But because Paddington was so real to her, it was like feeling like your child is achieving something: you're proud of them, even though it's not directly your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged himself as Paddington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On the ground, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
"They called regularly to say that her daughter was in very bad condition and that they did not believe she would survive", said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad, who said my daughter was gonna die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you around.
I'll be with you soon.
The drugs doctors gave him to keep his heart beating had quietly started to disappear and leave his body.
He was dead a while before, and now all systems were starting to stop working.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I could not cry, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing of her experiences.
"No one knew it", he said.
I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of compassion for Nadia on that flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.
Postcards from a pregnant woman prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide nail work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted maps onto the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile would make the whole room shine.
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died, because he was in a very bad place with the 'homes.'
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had committed suicide.
Ms Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to have a doom effect".
Miss Davis created these cards to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even a friend.
Don't be quiet. You have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after the death of the husband's mother.
He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything, he said.
We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on the first Christmas Eve when the kids opened their presents, he had no eyes or anything with them.
Ms. Humphreys said the man's death was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it:
It's gonna tear us to pieces.
But we must go on and keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
I believed that if we could actually get something he wanted  a limited time and scope of investigation  we might be able to achieve unity, Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would collapse  amid a persistent partisan standoff.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their objection was due to age.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans don't do as well as they'd expect, they'll be emotionally weakened in their plans to get the man they want to be on the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the senators lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the deciding vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean troops decreases under Kim's rule
South Korean lawmakers have said that the number of North Korean troops in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seung, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Harmonization, said that compared to the 2011 army units (2706) their numbers had decreased in the previous year (1127).
Mr. Park said the main factors were stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a greater number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Korean troops have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to the Seoul Times, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest national border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China takes troops as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back home by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of the nuclear weapons.
This came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for a lack of progress in sanctions.
"Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security and under these circumstances we have not agreed in any way to unilaterally become the first to be armed", Mr Ri said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to be a Supreme Court justice.
House Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
Pelosi expressed his opinion in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I have made it clear that if a woman had acted in this way, she would have been labeled hysterical, Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening words, describing his family and high school years, and at times he almost cried and sometimes was silent.
He also expressly condemned members of the Democratic Party who were on the committee, calling the allegations against him about Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat an organized "grotesque and coordinated publicity killing" by angry liberals.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man was unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice because it showed that he was anti-Democratic.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was humble when asked if he would try to remove Kavanaugh if he were confirmed, if the Democrats were to gain a majority in the House.
"I'm saying as much as I'm saying that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only fit to be a Supreme Court justice, but he's not fit to be a judge in the court he's currently working for", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible decisions against the Kavanaugh Affordable Care Act (health law  translator's note) or Roe v. Wade (abortion law court presiding  translator's note) because the man is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical person to become a judge and expect us to say whether or not it's not nice", Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, a month-long, year-long rage, and she can't help but cry.
"We cry when we get angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do I?
He went on, "I got help from a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said she cried when she got angry, too, but she developed a method that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I was crying because I was sad.
I'm angry with you.
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
The spark is partly accepted as the outcome of anger because it is fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is of an early job in a mostly male office, where I once found myself crying in an indescribable rage as an older woman, a tough driver, whom I had always been afraid to kiss, grabbed me from the crate and pulled me up the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying", he told me.
They don't know you're a drug addict.
They think you're sad and that gives them satisfaction.
Patricia Schroeder, a Republican congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on her husband's presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a boat called Monkey Business between an extramarital affair and the end of the campaign, deeply upset Schroeder thought that there was no reason why he should not consider running for president himself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
Juba had seven candidates and the last thing they needed was someone else to join.
Someone said it was like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was coming to an end, he was late for the fundraiser and he promised not to run unless he got two million dollars in total.
It was a hopeless battle.
He found out that some of his supporters who donated $1,000 to men gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When he gave a speech announcing that he would not run an official campaign, his feelings of gratitude for the people who supported him, his anger at the system that made it difficult to raise money and turn to voters instead of delegates, and his hatred of sexism, were so overcome that tears came to his throat.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalled the press reaction to him.
You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were writing on my gravestone.
She was crying?
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The trade war between the United States and China has been a daunting one, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the gap between nations could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by imposing tariffs on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs, which are worth $200 billion in goods, essentially imposing tariffs on half of the goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same way each time, most recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised the United States a shot to the back of the head, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to look anytime soon.
Getting Washington back would mean giving in to demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing issues its cards correctly, a trade war with the US could support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a rushed political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that lead to a loss of control over the economy in another country is actually far more dangerous than previously acknowledged by sidelines, said researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on Asia research at the Center for New American Security.
The Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready to allow the refugees to return voluntarily and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
The situation is now more stable and secure on the territory of the country, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government will continue to restore normalcy to the areas destroyed by terrorists.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting daily life and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid to rebuild the devastated state.
However, he stressed that the State would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating France at Le Golf National golf course near Paris with a US team final score of 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Captain Thomas Bjorn of Denmark scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
The US star Phil Mickelson, who was in the thick of it all, threw a 16 on the par-3 course, giving up the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his sports, becoming one of only four players to have achieved the result of the tournament in its current format since 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5&4 European team bottom Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, outscored England's Ian Poulter by two to one, who could have won the last Ryder Cup.
The eighth Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the highest-scoring European of all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the pack back.
It's team spirit and I'm glad I was able to help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's giving the ball to fellow American Jon Rahm, who won the singles match Sunday against US golfer Tiger Woods 2&1.
"I'm extremely proud to have won Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13:21:3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, falling behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was on a weekend-long quest to find fairways; the exception were Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States said after the team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the guys, they were hearty.
There was a time in the morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Put your hat down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to lighten the hat.
We were played better.
New information on water treatment: decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasotas
The most recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a decline in overall concentrations of flowering vines in the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, there have been reports of more flush flourishing in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which suggests decreasing concentrations.
The extent of the tidal range is about 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The species can be found 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but the number of locations has decreased since last week.
Water shortages have also been reported in Pasco County.
Over the past week, moderate concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County on the coast or in the high seas, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County on the high seas, low to high concentrations in Manatee County on the backcountry and in the high seas, low to high concentrations in Sarasota County on the coast and in the high seas, low to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, low to high concentrations in Lee County on the coast and in the high seas, and low to high concentrations in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in North Florida in the past week.
