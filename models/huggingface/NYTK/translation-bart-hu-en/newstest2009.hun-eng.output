Prague Stock Exchange was minus the end of trading
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the morning crash .
Transactions with shares of the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ ) have reached nearly half of the usual daily trading .
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its fall on Monday right from the start of Tuesday ’s trading when it dropped almost six percent .
This time , Wall Street stock is falling behind the decline .
This is how the market reaction is expressed in our opinion on the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives , which refused to support the stability plan of the financial sector there .
Shares falling in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in shares on Tuesday , although some of the losses were eventually cancelled during the day .
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock exchange index described almost four percent during trading , but later deleted some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent .
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index , which monitors Chinese shares in Hong Kong , dropped 3.8 percent , and in Shanghai , markets were closed .
Sydney stock lost more than five percent , but lost to 4.3 percent .
The Taiwan Stock Exchange , according to the index there , dropped 3.6 percent .
" The timing of the American rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world 's financial markets , " said Joseph Yam , head of Hong Kong 's financial council .
Hong Kong , although China is part of it , defines its financial policy independently , that is , independently of the Chinese central bank .
In Hong Kong , interest rates are at the same level as the United States .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that US legislators should start negotiations immediately and adopt the financial system support proposal .
Otherwise , other countries will feel the consequences of this .
The bloodbath of American shares
The US House of Representatives rejected the draft financial system support on Monday , which should have been spent $ 700 billion ( almost 12 billion crowns ) .
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush 's call to support the plan .
Bush said the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy .
On Monday , American shares experienced a bloodbath and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years .
Dow Jones fell almost seven percent , similar to the last time he lived in 1987 .
The index fell before the vote , but as it turned out that the proposal was not adopted in the House of Representatives , the index began to fall free .
Congress has withdrawn : The US government can pumped $ 700 billion into banks
The US Congress 's chief leaders and the government of President George W. Bush agreed to a broader agreement and financial assistance to the US financial system .
They 're voting on this at the beginning of next week .
The US legislators have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system of $ 700 billion ( approximately 12 billion crowns ) .
But there is no victory .
Congress must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form and vote of the law .
The draft financial system support is discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday .
On Sunday , Reuters news agency was informed by Barney Frank , Chairman of the Financial Organisations Committee .
Senate sources say that the draft may be voted on Wednesday as soon as possible .
Economists believe that a report should be made that the rescue plan is approved , which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of money markets .
However , thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms , " sobering " is then carried out .
Paulson : The plan must be effective
" We 've made a big step .
We have solved our different views on how to form a package for stabilising the market , ” said the Bloomberg agency , Democratic Nancy Pelosi .
He thinks the final vote will be held on Sunday .
Representatives of the legislators met Henry Paulson , the US Minister of Finance on Saturday night to give a final form to the government fund .
This should buy from financial companies the unseal mortgage Activities that put financial firms in serious losses and jeopardize the stability of the entire system .
" We are close to the final agreement on a draft that will work , and which must be effective on the market .
The draft repair plan must continue , but I think we are there , ” Paulson said .
Signal of Asian trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that are falling fast .
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid , the legislators are therefore seeking to reach an agreement in Congress on Sunday .
This is to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets , where the time zone would be the first place to influence the decision of Congress on Monday trading .
However , it is unclear yet , when two chambers of Congress of America vote on the law , and neither does it , whether the trial can not be delayed at the last moment due to any problems .
The legislators are hoping that the law will be approved in the coming days .
However , the law is still going through many changes .
The total amount to help the system should be divided into two parts .
President George Bush 's request is that the first 350 billion dollars should be available as soon as possible .
However , Congress may block the issuance of the remaining amount , which was set at another $ 100 billion and later $ 350 billion , if it feels that the program does not perform its function .
Bush evaluated progress in negotiations
Although the President may rule on this decision , the Congress may override its veto .
However , despite these changes , the basic idea of the programme remained , which was the acquisition of financial instruments to buy the bad mortgage securities losing their value , as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgage .
" We 've worked everything out .
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday and the Senate should vote on Monday , " said Republican Senator Judd Gregg .
With the progress made in the negotiations , President Bush is also satisfied .
Tony Fratto , Bush ’s spokesperson , stated that the president was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and evaluates the two - party efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy .
Restriction of busy severance
The President of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd , who led the negotiations , said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme , the protection of taxpayers from losses , the closure of the discounts , and the timing of the draft financing .
The new law also limits the so - called severance of the directors participating in the programme and establishes a committee supervising the fund .
The fund should be run by the Ministry of Finance .
" We have worked very hard on this , and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work , and which will be useful to all Americans , " Paulson said .
The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who have problems with the payment .
The government should negotiate new repayments for the mortgages it buys , with the aim of reducing monthly debtors ’ repayments and allowing them to keep their houses .
Marek : Spiritual aid
The proposed draft is a good idea , but it will be very difficult to implement it .
" All because you can not know what mechanism and at what cost the problematic active ones will be bought .
This will be decisive how the financial sector and the government distribute losses among themselves , ” said Marek .
Marek says it 's so irrelevant that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week .
" It is much more important that Congress decide this week to support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible .
The spiritual significance of the agreement on the fact that the plan is approved is the most important thing at this moment , ” said Marek .
Parade on blade : MP3 players versus mobile .
We help you choose
While almost all mobile devices can play MP3 files , no MP3 player can be called .
It makes it clear that it is better to buy only a phone .
However , there are many reasons for a person to acquire a separate MP3 player .
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner .
It 's probably hard to get a high - end , expensive record player to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc album .
On the one hand , such musical products do not appear on vinyl disks , but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view .
However , if shelves are full of art rock , jazz or blues vinyl discs , then you probably dream of such a record player .
This is similar to the travel , i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music .
There are also price and quality categories .
For some , it is unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player , as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a twenty - crown headset .
Two extremes , which everyone has enough space .
There 's a wide selection .
The life of the batteries also counts
Some top - quality music players can do much more than just play music , but also to which most of the mobile devices do not happen .
No device is as universal as the phone .
The primary functions , along with the phone and text , can play music and video , record both , have a better , worse camera , even navigate .
And if we consider smartphones and communicators , he 'll have a small computer in his pocket .
It 's a miracle , because no refrigerator can grill and no television can take pictures .
There are also disadvantages to multiple mobile phones .
The more features you use on your mobile , the more times the display sends to the charger .
And music play is one of the biggest energy eateries .
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours , mostly this is much less .
In this respect , music players ( especially the simplest ones ) are significantly more powerful .
That 's why you should count on cheap cell phones that wo n't be playing for you for more than a few hours .
If you even call here and there , get a charger for your workplace just to be safe - this also applies to more expensive devices .
MP3 players will not have this problem , even the worse can last at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a charge .
The next problem arises when you upload music to your mobile .
Unfortunately , only a limited portion of the devices have a universal USB socket and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without any special software .
Of course , music can be recorded directly on the memory card , but only a few card readers can cope with miniature memory cards used in mobile devices without an adapter .
With a few exceptions ( iPod ) , players do not need any special software .
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB .
Most of the mobile and playback players are already performing their own , the album , genre name , or , for example , the user 's rating , the music library is created in order .
Some devices only represent a tree structure similar to Windows Explorer , and some of them are known (iriver , Samsung , Sony , Cowon , smart phones with operating system ) .
Players are easier to use , mobile devices know more
When choosing a specific equipment , you should first of all ask about the life of the battery , the capacity of the memory , the quality and type of sound output , and of course the comfort of the treatment .
If music serves as a background for you and only listens to you on the tram for a short time a day , any mobile MP3 player will suit you .
And any mobile phone can do that .
You do n’t even need to pay particular attention to what music formats your mobile or player can do .
The MP3 is all coped with and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format .
MP3 is among the most common and the vast majority of devices cope with WMA format music .
AAC ( format used by Apple and iPod ) is less common .
Better mobile phones also allow for example to buy music online .
It is enough to visit the corresponding pages of the provider ( or other provider ) via the mobile internet and purchase the song or album .
This service can be a strong argument for the purchase of a music mobile .
Unfortunately , the service providers offer crap and are usually limited to only one summer radioágers .
Prices are n't the lowest .
However , it is generally assumed that the music will dominate the music industry in the future ( via GSM , internet or wireless internet ) .
Most people keep their cell phones with them all the time .
He 's always in the mood to listen to something , he 's scanning his cell phone in his pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home .
However , it still depends on whether you always carry the headphones or at least the hands - free ones .
If not , you can use the built - in speaker , which almost all mobile , but only a few MP3 players have .
For many , the most likely advantage of musical cell phones will be the price .
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner .
Between three and four thousand kroner , you can get enough decent walkman .
However , you are mostly limited by the lack of the output of the conventional headset .
The best and most technically equipped phones with traditional 3.5 mm diameter - hole headphones can cost up to fifteen thousand crowns .
The advantage of players is , however , simple handling .
The simplest - in no case necessarily the most inexpensive players ( see our selection ) are really coping with .
Minimum function , the treatment of the previously standard cassette recorder or gramophone is obvious .
There is no threat of crash in the form of an accidentally turned on mobile internet , nor in connection with the huge invoice that follows for data transfer .
What device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones ( e.g. Vodafone 527 ) usually have openings for removable memory cards ( M2 , microSD type , etc . ) .
The right card can be bought into up to 2,000 crowns .
But be careful .
The basic types only support cards with maximum capacity of up to 2 GB .
Only the most expensive ones can do what with up to 8 GB of memory cards .
If you already have a mobile and want to buy cheap MP3 players , choose Cowon , Creative , Sony , Samsung , Emgeton or irivert .
Based on the capacity ( 2 GB max ) , you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns .
If you are a member of the more demanding students , choose more specific mobile -walkers ( Sony Ericsson , some Nokia and Samsung ) .
These devices also have a separate MP3 button , so the convenience of the treatment is approaching the MP3 player .
The most remote in the sector is Sony Ericsson , which has the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately .
MP3 players of the above brands can provide the same service in the same price range up to 4,000 crowns , but with higher memory capacity ( up to 16 GB ) and battery life ( usually 15 hours , up to 35 hours ) .
The first virtual service provider will reach Czech Republic this year .
Maybe
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our service providers offer the same services as their Western European partners .
Nevertheless , we lack something here - a virtual service provider that forces classical service providers to reduce prices .
Maybe it wo n't be for long .
On the Mobile.cz website we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe .
This was confirmed by the ČTÚ , which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than the rest of the EU .
After the recent European Commission ’s entry , the roaming charges may therefore be considered to be a controversial situation – some Czech mobile operators ’ clients will be cheaper than domestic text messages .
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe ?
The answer is simple , we lack competition to fight .
This may sound controversial , because we have three mobile networks and penetration is above 100 % .
On the contrary , mobile operators are eager to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive .
He often agrees with Pavel Dvořák , President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office , who has stated a few times that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic .
Perhaps it is true that the classical provider with its own network probably does not have much chance ( however , it is likely that it would find it difficult to find a frequency ) .
But there is also another option - a virtual provider .
The mobile market entry of virtual service providers has brought a significant price decrease , which the classic service providers had to respond to .
In the meantime , even before the big fish entered the market , such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Britain , sounds like ours .
However , it has been proven that such service providers have a place and can be successful .
However , for example , we do n’t have to go too far .
This February , we informed you about the launch of the Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland .
In less than half a year , this provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest provider there .
Meanwhile , the Penta financial group is behind Mobilking , which is the owner of U:fon in the Czech Republic .
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group .
For efficient operation , you need much less customers than the traditional provider .
It does not entail relatively high construction , mobile network operation and maintenance costs .
Virtual service providers in the world thus usually appear as low cost - they offer cheap calls and text messages , which are often offset by fewer services .
For example , Tesco Mobile from Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper text messages than its competitors .
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows , it is quite a good bet to bet on a target group .
This provider is specifically focused on men .
" Real men choose Mobilking providers - who they like , who they can trust , " says David Seibert , CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company , who operates this virtual provider .
It is hard to say whether the idea like Poland can work with us .
Miroslav Čepický , spokesperson for Vodafone , doubts : " The Czech market is relatively small for segmental approach , based on which most virtual service providers are based .
In addition , it is relatively satisfied with the offer of services . "
In the Czech Republic , there is no chance , they claim mobile operators
However , it seems almost certain that if you become a virtual provider in the Czech Republic , it will not be Mobilking .
" We are talking about the successful expansion of this project , but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem to be very hopeful .
Mobilking is launched in other countries of our region , ” said Jana Studničková , spokesperson for the Penta financial group in his phone interview to Mobil.cz .
This indirectly proved that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic do not have a very similar interest in this idea .
On the contrary , they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition is possible .
The GTS Novera Group has been keeping its interest in launching a virtual service provider for some time , which is therefore trying to take another step to make Telefonica O2 a real competitor on the field of corporate customers .
" We are very interested in providing our customers with not only fixed - line , but mobile telecommunications services .
And the sooner the better .
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators .
Some of them have already been able to progress in negotiations , ” says Pavel Kaidl , spokesperson of the group .
Maybe now 's a good time .
Out of official information , it seems that we can be lucky for the first virtual provider by the end of the year .
His birth is still surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence .
" At this moment we do not think that a full - fledged virtual service provider should be in the Czech market .
The Czech market is very special , unlike other markets .
We have not yet been addressed by an unequal subject offering complex and serious projects in this area , ” said Vlastimil Sršeň , the Telefónica 02 Press Department .
The Czech market is also referred to by other service providers .
Martina Kemrová , spokesperson for T - Mobile , with O2 exceptionally , adds : " So far , we have not recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects to which it can be based . "
And he added : " In the T - Mobile network by the end of the year , it is unlikely that any virtual provider will appear .
At this moment , we should have a concrete agreement on our table to think in such a short term . "
Vodafone is more focused on meeting its own 3G licensing requirements .
Miroslav Čepický adds : " We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers , especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing .
This is what we consider the most rewarding for our customers .
The main strategy of Vodafone is to find a partner in this area to build networks shared with the fast mobile internet . "
Responsible agencies - in a string with service providers
The process of mobile operators is easy to understand , the entry of another provider would mean the increase in competition , and thus lead to a decrease in their profits .
So why make it easy to enter such a competition ?
When providers have something important , they can cooperate , testify to the draft of the birth of U:fon .
The greatest pressure on ČTÚ was likely to be around the birth of the U.M. Phone of T - Mobile .
This is the case with the public information from ČTÚ ’s website .
But right now , U:fon comes to a good point , why not allow the entry of the virtual provider .
Martina Kemrová added : " The environment of the competition in the mobile market has recently been authorised by the accession of the fourth mobile operator to the market .
In view of the nature of the Czech market , it is clear that entering another player would impose high requirements on the market and its services . "
However , given the attitude of mobile operators , the total lack of interest of Czech regulatory bodies is amazing .
In the meantime , it is not only about ČTÚ ’s attitude , unfortunately , in the Czech Republic , unlike Britain and other developed countries , it is not allowed to interfere in the economic competition .
Only the Economic Competition Office is entitled to this .
But the office is a characteristic attitude to the whole problem .
" The entry into the virtual service provider ’s mobile market would only be possible after the contract between the mobile operator and the virtual service provider was concluded on the hiring of the necessary infrastructure .
So far , no such contract has been concluded , as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting to traditional service providers , " said Kristián Chlapua , the external relations department of the Competition Office .
A statement from representatives of service providers as described in this way would probably not surprise anyone .
However , from the office that should represent the interests of consumers and , in addition , to ensure that no one can abuse their market position , this is more than strange .
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds : " Abroad , where virtual operators usually operate , we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the decrease in the price of mobile phone services . "
However , the pressure on the fair functioning of the market environment and the reduction of prices is probably not in the interest of ÚOHS .
In this case , it is a shocking harmony that comes from the reactions of the three mobile operators .
The question , whether it is really just a coincidence , is almost self - evident .
As with the filling stations , the completely identical petrol prices are certainly just the works of chance and hard competition .
" The Office has not discovered signs of anti - competitive proceedings in this case , so there is no reason to intervene in any way .
None of the providers have a leading position , i.e. they have no greater responsibility for their market activities .
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing by the telecommunications regulator , ” Chalupa said .
The presentation of the market leader is one of the many points of debate .
Of course , there is an analysis of relevant markets developed by ČTÚ , based on which telecommunications is the only market from the perspective of economic competition .
Naturally , no Czech service provider is in the lead after that on such a market .
However , some legal experts offer a different approach - the approval of the network operator is always necessary to create a virtual service provider .
And the mobile operator , relatively logically , has a monopoly on his own network .
So , in a certain segment , it is necessarily dominant .
But even if we did not accept this argument , it would have to be at least a warning for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are conspicuous in the same way .
Meanwhile , complaints from the list of interested persons ( including the already mentioned GTS Novera company ) show that they face very similar obstacles during negotiations with all providers .
The shift of responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a relatively common trick by which ÚOHS takes its hands off the whole case .
We 've met this before in some similar situations .
Unfortunately , in the text of the recently adopted telecommunications Act , the extension of ČTÚ ’s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not possible , although many experts hoped to improve the situation .
The representatives of the ÚOHS should know this well , but they are probably in different interests .
This works when no one is watching
In the meantime , it remains unnoticed by the operation of some pseudo - virtual service providers , from which many of them already operate in Czech mobile networks .
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service pricing lists , which are only partially public .
Because it 's multilevel marketing companies .
For example , Amway , Bohemia Telecom , Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services .
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones .
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic company client against the provider , which orders a large amount of SIM cards .
As a special customer , you will receive special offers ( and other discounts ) .
The problem is that all Czech mobile operators ’ trading conditions prohibit similar pre - entry .
" If there were cases of which he spoke , there could be a breach of contractual terms , which we would deal with , and which could lead to the completion of cooperation with the company concerned , " he answered our question about this problem to Martina Kemro .
But it 's highly unlikely that news of this kind of activity would not have gotten to the people responsible for mobile operators .
In particular , the three companies mentioned may be thousands of clients .
In the meantime , no service provider is defending against such a procedure .
These companies have no negligible profits and do not particularly threaten them with their own official marketing , unlike real virtual service providers .
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems : " The law allows similar speculation , however , only negligible percent of customers use the services of these companies .
They must also accept that the SIM card is not listed on their names , so they can not have full control over it as general customers of mobile operators . "
But that 's what the ČTÚ should be at least weird about .
In addition , another question arises for ÚOHS .
If mobile operators turn their eyes on similar procedures , why are they obstructing the birth of a virtual provider ?
It should be added that ÚOHS has a relatively strong power to expose such activities , and if you do not want it , you do not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect anything of this kind and that their trading conditions prohibit it .
When we 're not the most expensive
As it has been said a few times in the text , the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has brought a detectable price decrease in services .
In the meantime , in virtually every country where virtual service providers were established , classical service providers tried to prevent their creation more or less .
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small , perhaps too satisfied market , problems with the quality of services , etc .
However , in developed countries , the regulatory bodies intervened at these moments , which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators , but their customers .
Then , either through formal measures or informal pressure , they reached the first virtual service provider that others followed .
Unfortunately , the Czech regulatory bodies are giving each other the whole case .
Based on our experience , we can not get rid of the impression that unambiguous competencies are good for them in these cases .
But let 's not give up on the fight .
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming soon , the Czech mobile market may be back on the move .
If a provider permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator , ÚOHS may only be difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection ( discrimination ) of further interested persons .
And for the rest of Europe , we may not be calling more expensive .
The new Czech anthem has four new versions .
Choose the best
Listen to four processing of the new version of the Czech state anthem .
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek presented the new recordings of the Hol van homeland?State anthem on the day of the Czech State .
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlava .
There are four versions available - with male or female solo , vocal choir or instrumental .
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing .
The anthem is modified by authors Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček .
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz .
Bělohlava considers Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns .
He has already told the Czech Radio that he deliberately selected young singer with representative voices to half the solo variations , which are expressive and popular .
" From the beginning I tried to make clear fiction , the well - understanding and consistency of the text , " he said .
The Czech state anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year .
The song Hol van hazám? was first recorded in the Rendi Theatre in the play Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka in végső , accompanied by František Škroup .
It became popular , and people spontaneously considered it their own .
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after Czechoslovakia was founded in 1918 .
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic , it remained one of the seven state symbols .
What 's the " new " anthem ?
Prague transport company delivers chip cards for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday 1 October 2008 , the first passenger to receive a electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line ticket will enter the history of Prague Transport Company as a date .
The coupon is currently available for approximately 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card .
Passengers can buy 30-day and 90-day coupons ( valid from 1 January 2009 ) and save them for chip cards at the information centres and branches of the Transport Company at Muzeum,Můstek,ejtraží Holešovice,Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations .
The coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz .
The service was used by more than 400 customers for hours in the afternoon .
Those who start using online trading can forget about the subway stations ’ publishing windows , where they have to regularly go through long lines for the line tickets .
The coupon can be purchased over the Internet and the Opencard card is also saved in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library .
" In these locations , passengers have a counter - trained servers who help visitors to buy the internet and save their purchased coupons for their cards , " said Martin Opatrný , project spokesperson .
In addition to libraries , electronic coupons will also be saved to Opencard in self - service machines equipped in some lobby .
How do these vending machines look ?
They are red , they remind me of ticket managers and the passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly , Budějovická , I. P. Pavlova , Florenc and Vltavská metro stations .
" There are currently five in the city , but it should be 80 by the end of the year , " added Opatrný .
The coupon is controlled by automatic instead of the driver
Their operation tomorrow is simple to handle starting machines .
It is enough to insert the Opencard chip card and previously paid coupon will be saved from itself .
The electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital , but also in the area .
So on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499 , primarily for the inhabitants of the Middle - Czech walkways to the capital .
" In the trains classified in integrated transport in Prague , the guides were provided with card readers , which also set the validity of coupons , " explained Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization , which compiles the timetable for public transport in Prague .
In buses around the city , card readers are built at the cashier 's office .
So when boarding , the driver must not only show the chip card , but also place Opencard in the place specified on the cash register .
The driver checks the validity of the coupons .
" For example , if the passenger needs to check the validity of coupons , the easiest thing to do is ask the driver to do so , " added Drápal .
Passengers who do not travel with buses around the city and will not remember when their coupons expire can go to self - service machines saving coupons for cards again .
The information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the equipment display .
The Sudetas wanted a referendum from the United States
The Sudet Germans requested the annexation of Šumava to the United States in 1945 .
This is revealed from the letter in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library .
If we can not be part of Germany or Austria , we want to live under the cartridges of the United States of America .
It was said that some groups of Sudet Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945 .
This is also revealed from a letter of a private archive , which is now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library .
Česky Krumlov Germans in the letter ask the President of the United States not to allow the return of the " county ofšumava " to the Czech Republic , which was occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty .
" We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure in those words that the American troops in the German territories are not coming in as oppressors and enemies , but as liberators , " there are " people who are in their hearts " , signed with Šumava 's fate .
Since the Czechoslovakian attachment to the Sudet is supposed to be a gift to Germans , with the knowledge of Czech national character , only to brutality , relentlessness , not understanding , oppression and slavery , the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take over Šumava the protector " now and forever " .
" We can not believe that , regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants , this area would be considered to be a foreign country that oppresses and repels the minority , and would not contribute almost anything to the victory of the Allies , " he said .
The reason why the authors could n't sign was supposed to be fear of the vengeance of the " Checheh suppressors " .
So if the President of the United States were supposed to doubt the opinion of the German Jews in šumava , it would be enough to refer to the county of šumava if its inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States and live under the US cartridges .
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive , in addition to the current knowledge of postwar history , some historians say it properly illustrates the expectations of the Sudet Germans at the time .
Even if the Czech Germans had to have a minimum sense that they were going to be evacuated from the country , few of them recognized this possibility .
Some expected the United States and Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for Sudets .
They were hoping to stay in Czechoslovakia .
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa , an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovic .
During the war , Chalupa served as a German in the Baltic Sea .
When the British captured him at the end of the war and put him in Holštynsko detention camp , dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech .
" They were hoping that when they came home , they could use the Czech language , " Chalupa said .
According to the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war , no one reported that they were being evacuated from the country based on the Beneš Decrees .
You do n't think - you pay !
The emotional campaign is attacking leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history is the safety of roads .
It would also be possible to describe the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday .
Minister Aleš Řebíček 's office from this campaign hopes to discourage leaders from acting dangerous behind the government .
The 150 million campaign will be on television , radio , cinema , the Internet , but it will also be published on flyers .
You should scare the drivers off speeding and alcohol .
And you should also remind them to put their seat belts in before they go .
It is primarily aimed at the conscience of young drivers , motorcyclists , pedestrians and not least professional leaders .
And what is displayed in the ads??
They are the most emotional , primarily human stories .
This is also the case with the " bloody " slogan of the entire campaign :
You do n't think - you pay !
The term " not thinking " on the license plate is written in large letters .
And the blood pool has the word " pay " .
This should symbolize that one can pay for a momentary disregard with his life .
The audience is " terrified " by advertising spots until 2010 .
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns from the Anglo - Saxon countries , where drastic images of victims of accidents can be seen regularly .
They hope that the number of accidents and deaths will be reduced on Czech roads .
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency .
Pull it , let the drivers
" Drivers are subject to ' pull , let 's ' system .
" Let them " is when , for example , they pass red , saving time .
" Pull " is the danger of punishment or accident .
The driver must be reminded of the risk , ” says Martin Kořán , a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital .
And that is why the information campaign is needed in the press , especially for the negative campaign , is considered by the psychologist .
He said that the driver 's attention to danger boards are less effective .
" If the warning board is installed , it will likely soon merge with the environment and the drivers will not deal with it , " said Kořán .
Olmer would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace .
Ehud Olmer , the president of the temporary Israeli government , spoke of the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967 , namely the western coast of Jordan , East Jerusalem and the Golan Basin , in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria .
He said that in an interview , which he published on Monday , the Jedi Achronot .
" We must agree with the Palestinians , which means that almost all , if not all ( landed ) areas must be returned , " he told the newspaper .
" We keep a certain percentage of these areas , but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage of Israeli territory , because without it there will be no peace , " he added .
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem .
" He who wants security in Jerusalem and wants tractors and bulldozers not to cross his feet as one of my best friends did , must give up part of Jerusalem , " he noted Olmer was referring to the attack on two cities in July , in which some people were killed and a few dozen were injured .
According to the Prime Minister , it will be necessary to find a special solution to the " Temple Mountain , sacred and historical places " located in the Old City .
" The person who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270,000 Arabs .
This is not going to work , ” he stressed .
The Golan World Cup
Olmer also gave an opinion on the exclusion of Israelis from the Golan Basin , which he believes is an indispensable condition for the peace treaty with Syria .
This would require some effort from Damascus .
" I do not recommend peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan , " he warned .
" Syrians know what they have to give up to get Golan .
They must give up their relationship with Iran ; give up their relationship with Hezbollah ( Skiing Movement ) ; give up regular support , which Hamas ( Skiing Movement ) provides terrorism of Al Qaeda and Jihad ( Holy War ) in Iraq , ” the Prime Minister explained .
Questions after an accident : Passenger attendants are unlawful in buses ?
The law does not know them , it is not allowed to walk in a long - distance bus
The question arises about the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near Padova , whether passengers and passengers can travel in the bus on the way .
" If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law , the flight attendant 's activities are contradictory to the law on transport activities , " says Karel Hanzelka , spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport .
Last week , the death of a twenty - two - year - old flight attendant was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus .
At the moment , she was sitting next to the driver , at the least safe place on the bus , although there were two more seats for her .
The bus may collide or stop suddenly at the moment when the flight attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper .
It has a role to see if the bus has a station according to the registration permit .
If the bus is not homologized , passengers must sit .
The Student Agency has no standing places ; which is confirmed by Aktuálně.cz by Radim Jančura , the company ’s director .
" We tried to find a solution to this ministry , and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed .
However , this was withdrawn and we have concluded that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey , if they have their own meeting , ” he said .
The law does not know the flight attendant
" There is no clear legal regulation on the role of a flight attendant - no legislation regulates that position .
However , no law prohibits the supply of services to the carrier .
The road traffic law is only aware of the concept of the vehicle attendant ; it does not define its rights and obligations , ” adds less clearly to it the spokesperson Hanzelka .
Josef Pokorný , Director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operations at the Ministry of Transport , on the contrary believes that the law will handle the problem properly .
" It depends whether the bus is registered in the registration permit .
And that 's it , " he says .
Buses are distinguished by the fact that they can be urban , where there are standing places and limited with maximum speed and places between cities and with a higher speed , as well as long distance spaces without standing and at maximum speed , seat with seat belts .
As on the plane , says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín , a transport safety expert at BESIP , sees no fundamental problems on board the bus in the movement of flight attendants .
" There are no threats during continuous progress , we can compare the situation to the aircraft service .
I 'm not sure when turbulence is here , and the flight attendant can hit his head . "
" If the bus suddenly brakes , of course , its physical laws apply .
Same as in city buses or tram .
The carrier must solve the safety of the flight attendants with internal rules , ” he says , and also believes that the problem is not solved from the point of view of the law .
Jančura is ready to terminate services
The Student Agency offers passenger service as a single bus carrier .
He employs 200 flight attendants .
The director does not consider their occupation risky after the accident .
" As soon as I get the impression that the occupations of flight attendants are risky , I 'll stop them .
The coffee and newspapers can be received when passengers get in .
This would also be cost savings , ” he says .
In his vehicles , he justified the absence of flight attendants by Alexej Litvin , Director of Asiana , who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency .
" We have no flight attendants , we have been against this from the very beginning .
Sooner or later , this will end with some kind of fatal injury , " he said to Týden.cz just a year ago .
Incredible tragedy has occurred
The young flight attendant from Pzeň , who worked for the company two years ago , died on a timetable flight to Naples .
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stop zone without using a directional signal and stopped the bus .
The driver of the bus tried to avoid him with a sudden maneuver , but the front of the bus hit him .
It means that two reserved seats for the rest of the flight attendants were sold , Jančura refuses .
" These places can not be booked on long - distance flights , blocked . "
The company wants to sue the truck driver .
By compensating the girl 's family , the agency does not expect a court ruling , but also expects financial compensation from the guilty party .
Modification of the law ?
In the distant future
The modification of the law on board the bus could be clarified by the traveler ’s movement , on which the 30-man expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year .
" The group did not get any concrete results .
Buses are not so much , but rather the point system deals with the maximum speed allowed on the highway and mobile use during driving , ” says Hořín expert .
" The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be something that would basically threaten the safety of passengers , " says spokesperson Hanzelka , that the control of the safety of buses falls within the competence of the police and the labor agencies .
The hopes of Düsseldorf depend on Frankfurton
The letter of the WestLB ’s board of directors to the staff of the bank does not need to be written in the big words .
From the merger of the units of the financial institution in Düsseldorf and the Frankfurt Deka - Bank , " the central capital market organisation of the savings fund financial group " could be created , the letter published on Monday .
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable " competence block " into a business like this .
Such a relationship could give the decisive boost to further concentrations in the provincial banking sector .
This is the reading of a board of directors in difficult times trying to prove their capacity to act .
Because the unstable WestLB bank continues to be under enormous pressure .
Not only by the EU Commission , but also by the Federal Financial Services Authority , which recently informed the Northern Rhine - Westphalia provincial government that there is a deadline for finding a lasting solution .
However , for savings bank customers , the topic of a relationship - Frankfurt part has been famous for its investment funds between Deka - Bank and WestLB for a long time .
Franz Waas , the head of the Deca - Bank , informed him at the end of August , that the bank and a provincial bank located on Mainzer Landstraß , such as Helaba or WestLB , do not see the meaning of the merger .
Nevertheless , the Board of Directors of the Deca , which is one half of the provincial banks and the other half of the representatives of the savings funds associations , entrusted the Board to negotiate with the WestLB on joint business activities .
In this context , the capital market business or certain parts thereof may be discussed .
However , negotiations , they claim financial circles , have only just begun .
With 3000 employees , the name of Deka - Bank , one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector , is not the first time that the savings banking sector is consolidated .
In 2003 , for a moment , Deka - Bank was united with Landesbank Rheinland - Palatinate and Helaba .
But this three - way alliance did n't turn into anything .
The plans were barely published , the provincial government of Hesse spoke against Hela 's interest .
The other two banks did not find each other .
Landesbank Rheinland - Palatinate instead came to the Landesbank Baden - Württemberg in Stuttgart .
However , the idea of the relationship between Deka - Bank and provincial banks has been raised again and again .
However , the last time Günther Merl , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba , spoke against the plans for mergers with his bank .
Nevertheless , the recognition is concerned that there is a need to approach different banks in the public sector .
Now , after the Bavarian provincial assembly elections , BayernLB and Landesbank Baden - Württemberg are the first to be connected .
For Helaba , that 's not necessarily good news .
If the pressure for further mergers increases , it can slowly run out of potential partners .
In South Germany , he could only be a junior partner , although he has already had a significantly better financial crisis than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart .
The merger with WestLB was excluded by the könnyebbverband Hessen - Thüringen , with 85 % in Helaba at the beginning of the year .
NordLB remains in the shortest place .
However , such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin .
On the other hand , the question arises how different business models of each bank fit together .
Merl stated in June that the German Savings Bank and Judges Association had yet to answer the decisive question of what business model should provide the future of provincial banks .
Finally , it is possible to cut up the WestLB , which is not intended there .
The letter of the board of directors there also states that they are definitely seeking a " complete solution " .
How this is compatible with the merger of individual units with Deka - Bank is still the music of the future .
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as " Italian Weekend "
Elena 's first , and it 's the third or fourth time for Luca .
Now Elena is here as her girlfriend , and so everything is quite different , says Luca .
Behind them , beside the Kaiser - brand five - litre barrel , is a strong - bodied bearded man , and proves to about 200 people traveling to Oktoberfest what deep sounds he can draw out of his throat .
Elena first takes Luca 's face , then kisses him .
They 're from Bologna to Verona .
From here , four buses from the bus parking lot near Puorta Nuova train station depart at 23.45 hours for the destination " destinazione Monaco , festa della birra " , arrival is expected at 6.30 .
Three buses are mainly held for Italians , only Brazilian people travel in the fourth .
In one corner of the parking lot , South Americans were already singing with their flag , and they began celebrating during the night .
And so loudly , it 's not for Italians , says Marco Guarda .
The buses are owned by Marco , wearing a long , artificial hair coat and wide silver - stalked glasses .
He 's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years , only this year he 's organised three roads .
At night , at the Oktoberfest , at 22.30 .
The accommodation would only be an unnecessary expense , says Marco .
The road costs 75 euros , which includes the welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bavarian beer purity law , accident insurance and German - speaking guide - Marco has completed a German course in Frankfurt .
And the buses are already getting into the night on the highway towards Brennero .
No beer , not yet .
The bus will be quiet soon , passengers will sleep .
All right , that 's it . They 're gon na need their strength .
They are taking a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen , where several Italian buses on the 8th motorway take a short break before Munich .
When Marco 's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past six months , there are almost 50 other buses from all over Europe .
Elena , Luca and the others are gathering , Marco is holding one last briefing , explaining the plan of war .
First : Everyone put on the yellow hat .
On the left side of this , the subtitle "ktoberfest " is written in fracture , alongside the Internet address of Marco 's travel agency : "conoscersiviaggiando.it " .
Secondly , " When the beer tent gates open , run , " Marco cries into the morning .
" Run ! " Run and take over places in the back of the tent .
" Not forward , because we are stuck , and not on the same benches , sit on each yellow hat , but spread out in the tent ! "
The one - litre jar costs 8.25 euros , screaming Marco .
And do n't forget the tip .
" Show security guards you 're behaving well !
As you leave your seats , they will be taken ! "
Third , " You 're back here at 11:30 tonight , " understood ?
And we 're going to Wiesn .
On the way , one of the men is a roadmarker , knitting yellow caps to trees , boards , and even one of the great Bavarian folk parties ' election posters .
We must prepare for retirement .
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest , known as " Italian Weekend " .
There are no exact figures ; there are 50,000 people who are crossing the Alps and barging into beer tents , and they say ten percent of all visitors to the weekend are coming from Italy .
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers , Italian volunteers helping the Bavarian Red Cross , which , with some 200 medical care in its national statistics , is the first place in Italy , preventing the British people who are stuck in the lowest level of Austrian ( around 80 ) and beating ( around 60 ) .
The Hofbräu beer tent is especially popular among Italians .
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable , emphasised by Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück , only last week .
It is fortunate that the politician used the word " relative " and even implicated that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis - like developments .
Because it happened this weekend .
The Hypo Real Estate ( HRE ) real estate financing company , listed on Dax , received a billion - dollar loan from the consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulences .
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that credit subsidies would be worth € 35 billion .
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest after the part used .
The money comes partly from private , partly public banks .
The loss of Depfa subsidiary is in the background .
According to a news report , Depfa , who is a state financing agent , loaned money to long - term projects and refinanced himself for these very short expiry - which is now impossible due to the distrust of the markets .
In the first half of 2008 , the bank ’s cash reserve decreased by 95 % to € 2.37 million , and its own capital rate was reduced from 1.6 to 1.45 percent .
River revenues and net revenues from cash shops fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year , from credit and fixed securities to claims , and revenues from liquidating the credit store ’s reserves fell to EUR 5 million by more than 70 percent .
Only due to higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the ex - post settlement costs of the conversion of the former Depfa group , and the reimbursement of interest rates under the competent regulation and the business of the contractor , there was a 16 % revenue deficit relatively moderate .
The former state financing speculated first with corporate real estate loans , which were later separated at Aeral Bank , after privatization in 1990 .
As the classical state financing allowed little to earn , Depfa has been more strongly involved in infrastructure projects and private investors and public - public - public projects ( PPP ) and has expanded its activities internationally .
The value of subsidiaries hypo Real Estate must now be described as " important effects " on the group 's results , they have been said quite generally .
In fact , the dividend payment did not occur .
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007 .
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure fund since Depfa was taken over .
It depends more on interbank market refinancing than other financial institutions , since it does not have customer deposits .
With the collapse of the American Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago , bank loans were dried up because banks were guarding their liquidity .
Hypo Real Estate needs short - term instruments to refinance some of Depfa ’s credit portfolio – about € 50 billion – annually .
According to Hypo Real Estate , the group 's funding needs are covered with credit for a reasonable period of time , and the company 's protected " from the influence of currently highly inefficient international financial markets . "
Other sources say that refinancing is insured by the end of 2009 thanks to the money .
Georg Funke , Chairman of HRE Board , stated that Hypo Real Estate Group does not need to use the financial markets for a reasonable period of time .
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority ( BaFin ) believe that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured .
This gives hope to the bank ’s shareholders and creditors .
But the dynamics and the indifference of the crisis can not be certain .
It is not even unimaginable that funding does not have to be fully used .
But the opposite of that can not be ruled out .
After the late news on Saturday , the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy , even the temporary rescue of the bank could not calm the mood .
The stock price fell to EUR 3.30 by a 75 % reduction .
In contrast , the bond rates are quite good .
While the debts listed in the first place are hardly changing , the exchange rates of the bonds ordered back significantly decreased .
The crisis is particularly affected by the previous subsidiary , the Württemberg Hypo bonds and , in a way , the periods of the period beyond the year 2009 .
While hypo Real Estate bonds have previously been a speculative investment alternative , their value resistance should now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system and the existence of the bank crisis and the fact that the financial institution , taking Depfa over , almost brought the crisis to the house .
As long as central banks , governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system , the payment of benefits by the deadline can be made .
Or it will happen , in which almost no one is willing to hope to overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months .
However , with the view of partial nationalization reports , the probability bordering certainty has now been merely a legitimate hope .
For long - term creditors , sleepless nights can be decided whether to separate their investment .
However , short - term investors can use the sale to reserve taxes on the tax to be paid for the exchange rates of the coming years .
Sylvana and the secrets of the box inside
When Sylvana Hiltrop , 16 , must introduce herself to the Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school , the girls start to giggle : The German girl is totally " kkavaí " !
What does that mean ?
Sylvana already knows the word mangoes - in the new exchange student blog she tells about Japan .
" The first day of teaching in Japan .
I was really excited .
I was already on my way to school , inflamed .
I live on the edge of Tokyo , towards Kavasaki , and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool .
I had to find the way alone , fortunately I was n't lost .
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony .
The students start to enlist from 8:00 until a short conversation with the teacher , the " home room " , begins at 8:40 .
But before the teaching started , it was my turn to introduce myself .
I 'm not the type to talk to people , especially in front of a class of 40 students .
Since I have n't had my school uniform , I 've put on an old skirt of my landlady , blouse , blue knee panty and black leather shoes .
So I stood in front of the cathedral in this outfit and tried to pronounce everything correctly : "ajonara , vo se Sylvana ... " -- My name is Sylvana , I come from Germany , and my birthday is in a week .
At this moment , I was very happy that I started learning the language for two years .
All 31 girls whispered , giggled and waved , and I kept hearing the word " kavaí . "
I 've known that from my manga .
This is a basic gift for Japanese girls , and it means " cute , sweet . "
And then I went to my place fast .
The girl sitting next to me smiled wide , felt honored to be sitting next to the exchange student .
The rest of the clock was pretty quiet , but when the bell rang , they ran right over .
Everyone was talking and laughing and asking questions and drilling holes in my stomach - but it 's quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese .
Then everybody unpacked their inside .
My guest - in - law made me a lunch like this - it 's totally different from the boring German lunch sandwiches .
I got spicy rice , little sausages , cucumber and algae salad , fruit and some kind of tofu pork .
Most of the time , I have no idea what I 'm eating in Japan .
Food looks strange and has a completely new taste .
In fact , everything is very delicious .
Yeah , well , maybe , except for the salted plums , brrrr !
In Japanese schools , the inmate is not just lunch .
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a gift of a crib , which is especially artfully made - in the hope that at lunchtime , she will get to know the boy better .
I read about this in my manga comics .
I wonder if I can observe that here .
" Why Japan?"- my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year .
I always said ,
" Because he 's just charming . "
I 've been reading manga for years .
And to understand the comics and the culture they described , I began to study Japanese at some point .
It was clear to me that I had to come here sometime .
Because I 'm attracted to tradition and customs .
And these are very precious here .
Japan is the country of the latest techniques and trends – and on the other hand , it is strict , disciplined and traditional .
And since everything is so well organized , I have never felt lost , even if Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen . "
Rats have emotions .
A rat or a moth is running in the event of danger .
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced : Animals have emotions .
But how can you examine whether they feel the same when they behave like us ?
In the " Edge " online journal , famous scientists have published their articles for years .
SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at the answers to the question " What it thinks is real , without being able to prove it ? " in one of its series .
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness , without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far . It is true that we can not even prove that other people are aware .
However , in this case , we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same .
However , as we investigate other species , and dissect perceptions or in general the questions of consciousness , we come to a difficult area , because the hardware does not match .
When a rat is in danger , he does the same thing as many other animals : pretending to be dead , fleeing or attacking .
People behave in a similar way , from which some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences .
But I do n't believe that .
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals .
On the one hand , human consciousness circuits almost always contain the side prefrontal cortex ( due to its role in short - term memory and implementation / management functions ) .
This broad area is higher than the other primates in humans , and it seems that other organisms are completely absent .
At least , in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex , for example , the consciousness of who we are , or in the case of design and decision - making ability , it is justifiably assumed that man is even different from other primates .
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man : Because a significant part of human experience is related to language , it is often claimed that it depends on consciousness .
In this case , animals can be excluded .
However , even if language was not dependent on consciousness , language would certainly influence it , so animal consciousness , whatever nature it may be , is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness .
Therefore , it is difficult to determine what the consciousness can be like for other animals .
If consciousness can not be measured as an internal and subjective thing , and because of the special hardware it can not be analyzed based on our own experience , then your research will bring us serious problems .
Most of my explanations relate to the content of conscious living , but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science .
The animal 's mind processes could be examined without regard to their content , and this is exactly what happens in the case of experiments on the short - term memory of primates , especially in the example of visualization .
However , in the assumption that Christof Koch and Francis Crick have examined , they rely more on the neural connections of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms : they can both be identical or not .
Interestingly , this hypothesis also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization .
What is the point of this emotion ?
I 'm going to lead this back to an emotional system , like fear , being activated in a brain that knows its own activity .
What we call " fear " is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defenseless system localized in the brain ( or its consequences , such as physical reactions ) occupies a work memory .
So , in the study of emotions , they are closely related to the areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans .
In addition to language , perception is divided into fine degrees , because with the help of words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states , to describe them to others as well .
In contrast , Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions are derived from simpler activities in the cortex and brain stem body perception areas , as well as Jaak Pankseep , who is more focused on the brain stem .
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution , it can play an easy role in the emotions that are comprehensive to species .
I ca n't theoretically deny that , but I find it inconclusive .
Pankseep believes that what seems to be fear in rats and humans , in both cases it probably feels like : How can you control whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave like this ?
A cockroach flees in danger , does he feel fear ?
In my opinion , only similar behavior is not yet evidence of the same experience .
Although neural comparison continues to help : rats and humans have similar brain stem , cockroaches do n't have brains .
But the brain stem is responsible for emotions ?
And even if it were provable for people : how can we prove this in the case of rats ?
I think rats and other mammals , but maybe even cockroaches ( who knows ? ) have feelings .
However , I do not know how to prove this .
And since their emotions are suspected to differ fundamentally from ours ( since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language ) , I 'm more interested in the emotional behavior of rats than emotional emotions .
In any case , progress in this area is expressed at the neural level , if we measure the same in rats and humans .
As I do not seek language and consciousness in rats , so do emotions , because I do not know if they exist .
For others , this may seem like a short - sighted attitude , but I 'd rather move forward than keep hitting the wall .
I 'm a practical emojiist .
Platini , President of UEFA : Grace time for Poland and Ukraine
The Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vassjunik said that the preparations would soon be directly held by the President and the Prime Minister .
“ The government sees the trust and proof of Ukraine in the UEFA Bordeaux decision that Ukraine believes in the ability of Poland to organize the European Championship , ” Vassjunik said .
" This does not mean amnesty for our country .
The work has just begun , and there is much to do in both countries . "
Both host countries are behind the construction of stadiums , roads , hotels and airports .
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums is reduced from eight to six .
" We ca n't waste any more time .
We have to work at top speed , ” said Grigoriy Surkis , President of the Ukrainian Football Association .
" UEFA will keep an eye on us . "
In Poland , they were meant to take even more radical action .
Following several scandals , the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance , replaced by Robert Zawlocki , independent supervisor .
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki .
There is a " serious risk that PZPN can not function according to the rules " , said Drzewiecki to the Polish PAP news agency .
" We have provided Michel Platini , the president of UEFA , with a letter that will not adversely affect the preparation of the 2012 EB . "
Only in the last season , several first league teams had to be classified in the lower class due to manipulation , and eventually the ligastart had to be postponed .
The Outrageous Dennis Quaid Returns Back
The actress wanted to promote a new film , she spoke in the interview about her personal life - and now she has a problem with her ex - husband .
Who 's rooting - and fighting back
The late roses of the war with the ex - married couple Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid : The two Hollywood actors fight each other in a nasty fight seven years after their divorce - in public .
Meg Ryan in the interview with the American magazine InStyle , last week , first spoke about the causes of divorce : " Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time , causing a lot of pain . "
And he only found out after the divorce how many women Dennis cheated on him .
The spiritual striptease was due to Ryan 's new press work on his film " Women " , which tells the story of adultery .
Dennis Quaid definitely responded to his declaration of unfaithful husband : " Terrible " , said 54-year - old actor to the newspaper " New York Daily News " , saying that Meg un unos - unununless repeats and moves the story of our relationship .
In addition , it is " regrettable " that 16-year - olds , together with Jack , are repeatedly " publicly reminded of the many pain and changes that divorce causes a child . "
While Ryan has been single since the divorce , Quaid remarried and recently became the father of a twin couple .
Therefore , his answer ends with the following side cut : " My life continues anyway .
I can be happy to know that I have a wonderful family , in which everything is all right . "
Prices of flights and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first half of 2008 , European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year .
According to a current study , flights in Germany have become less than 50 percent cheaper .
Prices for flights and hotel rooms have become more favourable again - so it can be summarized as a result of a study by American Express travel and financial service provider .
The company analyzed the first half of 2008 booking data and established a significant price fall in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase .
After the prices in the hotel market have risen for years , the accommodation has already become cheaper in many places .
Between January and March , prices increased by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 of 48 European cities under review compared to 2007 .
However , in the period from April to June , prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year .
This trend was most clearly seen in Paris and Rome , where guests had to pay 30 - 37 percent less than a year earlier .
The reason for this is that American Express sees it in the low rate of the dollar , which led to " a lively travel spirit for American tourists " .
The reduction in hotel room rates affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London , such as Hannovert , Cologne or Stavanger .
In Norway , the 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices is a European record .
A growing change in the price of air tickets was also seen in the first quarter .
Due to the expensive kerosene , passengers had to pay more than 7.1 percent on the tourist class than in 2007 , while long - term flights with high fuel demand were 29.2 percent .
Between April and June , the prices for tourist - class flights decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter , but prices in the first class showed a much more moderate change .
In Germany , prices have fallen even more than in other European countries .
Between January and March , prices increased by 11.9 percent , and in the second quarter , they decreased by 23.6 percent .
The price of domestic flights in Germany has been halved according to the study .
The reason for the price decrease lies in the moderate economic growth on the one hand , the company claims .
In many segments of the airway market , demand weakened .
On the other hand , the pressure on competition is increasing as a result of the Open Skies agreement on air travel between the USA and Europe .
The tense situation is confirmed by the airlines cancelling their loss flights , and several airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe .
HSV beats Gladbach to 1:0
A single goal and simple methods led the tables to Hamburger SV .
At Borussia , Luhukay continues to fail to find the operational team .
Deep flight for the national team Marko Marin .
The player in Gladbach only got into the game late and his raise bounced back from the gate .
Your exact message has left your lips convincing .
He just knew he was right .
" We need the second goal " - sludge Hermann Rieger in the corridor leading to the Hamburg Arena cabins .
Not much happened in the catacombs , the break ended , and most of them were in their seats again .
Rieger was a physical therapist of HSV for nearly three decades , with more authority than some former players .
So , his request was heard at the competent location .
Coach Cornelius Jol nodded and showed his thumb in agreement .
Cornelius is the leader of Hamburg , Martin Jol 's brother .
His orders must have been similar : Here 's the second goal !
The order was cancelled .
" Today was not always a nice sight " - he admitted later Marcell Jansen .
Bastian Reinhardt " had a more relaxed imagination " .
The 1:0 ( 1:0:0 ) goal result is due to the head of Mladen Petric in Hamburg ; and the fact that the very weak gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak burgers .
" It was a dirty victory , " said Martin Jol .
Hamburger SV is 121 on Monday .
The audience celebrated their own Saturday afternoon , the blue sky above the arena and the table on the projector , which represented their team as the top of the league .
It 's a birthday without a party .
" We know where to put it , " said Marcell Jansen .
He believes that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates more unpredictable league than the dominance of HSV .
Although the team , due to its late - committed compositions , Neves and Silva , the goalkeeper Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern , finds himself slowly , but does not brilliant yet .
" We need more sense and deception , " he demanded .
After the vote

Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing uselessness among researchers for years . Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so - called swing - by maneuver .
Experts fear that Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity can not be fully correct .
The space probe " Uly tudott " flew in outer space for nearly 18 years .
The soon - frozen fuel lines threaten the death of ice cream .
Scientists have been causing confusion among them for years with a mysterious phenomenon called swing - by anomaly .
Swings - by means of gravitational rocking power of space probes , during which additional momentum is gained by an object , such as the Earth 's gravitational space .
So probes can save a large amount of fuel .
The Cassini - Huygens research probe in Europe , like the alvon of the vagyok vagyok vagyok vagyok vagyok solar probe , used this physical trick .
But what amazes researchers for years : flying objects do not behave fully as it would be expected under the ancient gravitational law .
Instead , disorders occur in the speed .
The probes are going to speed up or slow down unexpectedly .
Physicians have n't found any explanation for this effect yet .
The phenomenon was named swing - by anomaly .
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity may not be fully correct , which recognizes the mass attraction of matter as curvature of space .
American physicist Stephen Adler , a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong , and is trying to explain swing - by anomaly with the so - called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe .
" The dark matter may be responsible for the anomaly , which may be found even near the Earth " , says Adler .
The existence of dark matter was only known to space scientists ten years ago .
It is obviously a force of gravity that can be observed in its influence on other organisms .
However , the material itself is completely invisible , i.e. no electromagnetic radiation , especially visible light , emits or beats back .
Scientists calculate that a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe is made of dark matter .
Tourists abducted in Egypt have escaped
After ten days in the detention of their abductees , the tourists who were taken away in Egypt are free again - the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed .
Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros .
In the shooting before the hostages were released , six hostages were allegedly killed .
In South Egypt , five German citizens were abducted .
The ransom negotiations are underway .
Over and over again , Germans become the target of the kidnappers .
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases .
European tourists who have been taken away in Sahara are free .
This is what Egyptian public television , Al - Arabija Arabic television and Italian media reported .
According to Italian television news reports Sky TG 24 , Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release : " Our fellow Americans and other hostages were freed .
We are currently investigating their health , ” Frattini said .
The five Germans , five Italians , and one Romanian citizen , as well as eight of their Egyptian escorts are safe and sound - covered by Egyptian public television .
19 participants of the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo .
There is still a blur about the reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released : an Egyptian security officer said that the hostages were already willing to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisely killed their six .
" Problem solved .
They accepted the ransom , ” the official said .
" The trial was about taking hostages , " when suddenly it happened , " surprise . "
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in Sudan , Chad and Egypt on Sunday , and two were arrested .
Hostage takers demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany ; the money should have been handed over to one of the German hostages .
The newspaper " al - Masri al - Jom " reported a German intermediary stating that the release of hostages is due to the concern of the kidnappers for their own safety .
The report says that hostage takers release female hostages after the ransom payment .
Men are held by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route .
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report .
" Suicide " led to stepfather violence
In court , it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been abusing her for years .
In the village of Stithians , Cornwall , 57-year - old Michael Trerise spent six years in prison after confessing to attempted rape in eight counts .
The Truro criminal court found out that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven .
In a confession from Terrise , he wrote , " I feel responsible for his death . "
At the hearing , Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 in the Mutley district of Plymouth , on 1 April 2007 .
When she was a child in Coventry , Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her before intercourse while her mother worked in a beer room .
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as his residence again .
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth .
However , during the trial , it was revealed that Ms. Randle , who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Memorial Protection Organization , was persecuted by the terrorists of the twice a week of violence .
In 2006 , prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle , who had a passion for surfing and cycling , said her friends said " emotional dead " and " gave up on life " .
In April 2007 , his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his apartment inmouth .
He probably strangled himself with a bag .
Mr. Randle had a fight with his daughter 's stepfather , who finished his confession in a letter , saying , " I always tied him up and blindfolded him .
I did n't sexually harass him .
I feel responsible for his death . "
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise , " You are a very strange fetishist , and I 'm sure that was horrible for his sacrifice , especially when he was only seven .
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide .
But the fact that if he did n't , the case might never have been brought to justice . "
The judge added , " I draw attention to Stephanie 's parents ' impact on the crime you committed over the years .
If this had n't happened , it would have been a hopeful , successful and happy young woman . "
The official who lost important data has been charged
BBC has been informed that the government officials are being charged with violating official secrets of office who had left top secret documents on a train in June .
The male expert was on a mission from the Defense Department when he left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo .
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police .
This is the most low - profile accusation of breaking the law , and there is no suspicion of intentional offence .
Frank Gardner , BBC Defense Ministry correspondent , said that the move surprised many people at Whitehall .
" They thought the Ministry of Defense and the Government would handle this as an internal matter , " he said .
The employee who can not be named has been charged under Section 8.1 of the Act . This paragraph is about the preservation of information .
The state prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police be represented by the man for his rather sensitive work on the Joint Intelligence Committee .
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al Qaeda and the Iraqi military capabilities .
He was notified on Monday , and then moved from his home to a place unknown .
The housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
Britain 's home building cooperatives can expect an account of over 80 million British pounds after the bank Bradford & Bingley is saved .
The government spent £ 14 billion on protecting the deposits of Bradford & Bingley .
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors , including 59 home - building cooperatives .
The president of the Association of Housing Cooperative Cooperatives ( BBSA ) , Adrian Coles , says it 's " annoying " that companies and their members have to pay .
The refund of 14 billion important loans will eventually be made after the repayment of Bradford & Bingley mortgages .
However , the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use loans .
The Financial Services Dispensation System confirmed to the BBC that 59 home - building cooperatives were among them .
It 's annoying that the institutions who have been acting so carefully ... should now pay the bills of institutions that were far less cautious .
Adrian Coles , BSA
We learned that each company must pay the amount of deposit it holds . Companies share 18 % of the costs among themselves .
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan reaches £ 450 million in 2009 .
This means that companies have to save £ 81 million to pay the first year interest .
Adrian Coles , Director General of the Union of Housing Companies , told the BBC that he thinks the measure is unfair .
" It is outrageous that institutions should pay the bills of much less cautious institutions that acted carefully at the time of the boom in the housing market . "
According to BSA , no company has been destroyed since the beginning of their operation in 1945 .
" We need to examine this case in every way in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bills , " said Cole .
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March .
In 2010 , a full annual interest rate will be paid , which can be twice as much as the current one .
Because home building cooperatives are self - help organizations , without shareholders , eventually members will have to pay the bill , either through higher fees or lower interest received after deposits .
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
In Jersey , people have to pay more for milk .
The Jersey dairy company announced that it would raise the wholesale price of milk by another fivepence per liter on Monday .
This year this is the second increase in prices since the two penny increases in February and after a survey conducted by a consulting company .
Resellers decide whether they will forward the price increase to consumers .
Before the February increase , the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed last in 2002 .
They refused to apply for a former Member of Parliament of Bangladesh to defend themselves at large
The Bangladesh court rejected the previous Parliamentary representative Sheikh Hasina 's request for protection at the outset , which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country .
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend him on the grounds of the free movement of 50 million takers ( $ 729,700 ) from a businessman at the time of his parliamentary representative .
This case is just one of the many corruption charges against him .
Sheikh Hasina 's old political opponent Khaleda Zia was released on bail this month .
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks , but her party , the Awami League , demands that the temporary government supported by the country 's army , first give her full freedom .
According to reports , although he was released on parole to go abroad for treatment , the conditions for free legation do not clearly indicate whether he can preserve his freedom when returning to the country .
Your lawyers say you 're going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appellate court .
" The court of appeal refused Sheikh Hasina 's bail by not having to , since she was temporarily set free and taking part in foreign medicine , " we learned from lawyer Huq in Rafique .
" We will appeal against the decision of the court of appeal . "
His lawyers argue that he needs to defend himself at large so that he can return to the country and prepare for the elections in December .
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th .
He was detained last year after the military - backed temporary government took over , but he was released from prison in June to go abroad for treatment .
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any charges against them .
Afghanistan Polio vaccination program
According to the UN , almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been left out of the recently organised polio vaccination program due to the violence in Taliban .
Last week , the UN has organised a vaccination operation in six provinces .
However , they said that they could not reach the children in certain parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons .
According to a UN spokesperson , this happened despite the fact that the Taliban promised : they will not attack or impede the work of the vaccinated , thousands of staff .
The BSkyB appeal was rejected on the basis of the weboldal
They refused to appeal BskyB against the decision of the Competition Commission , which ordered him to reduce his interest in rival television television , in the keret keretr .
The Court of Competition Appeal required BSkyB to reduce its share of 17.9 % to 7.5 % in the maga maga .
Previously , the committee found that BSkyB ’s share would impede competition and would lead the company to unfair influence over the többi .
BSkyB acquired its share in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL , which has since been renamed Virgin Media in the purchase of the tanulmány .
In April 2007 , the Competition Office reported that the share bought by BSkyB from the magát magátbut in the year megintast of the Republic of Ireland jeopardizes the independence of thevállalvállal , encouraging the Competition Committee to launch an investigation .
Virgin Director Sir Richard Branson , Consumer Groups and Ofcom Supervision all opposed the acquisition .
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its eljegy - share would be meaningless and disproportionate redemption , especially given that BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights .
New investigation into the US state 's attorney 's case
The US Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. state prosecutors in 2006 .
The move followed that the report made by the Chief Inspector General of the Justice Ministry on the matter criticized the decisions of government officials .
The report criticized the White House officials , legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
The investigation was ordered because it was afraid that the state 's attorneys were released for political reasons .
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials who have been listening to this investigation have tried to obstruct justice by lying .
" The serious charges of possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified , " said Chief Inspector Glenn Fine .
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who had the power to confess witnesses .
The series began with nine state prosecutors removed from the US justice wallet in December 2006 .
At the time , they said that the state 's attorneys were dismissed for poor performance .
However , it was later revealed that the state 's attorneys had no worse evaluations than many of their colleagues .
Some state 's attorneys participated in the criminal prosecution of high - ranking Republican congressmen , while others refused to participate in the investigation of election fraud charges against Democrats .
The U.S. Attorneys are investigating and conducting court cases on behalf of the government .
They can be released at any time , but they can not be removed from their positions for political reasons .
The then leader of the Justice Ministry , Alberto Gonzales , became the target of the main state 's attorney attacks because of the discharge and finally resigned .
Many other officials of the judicial wallet also submitted their resignation .
In his opinion , the Attorney General is " the primary responsibility " for the dismissal , the role of " canceled " in the management and " exclusion " of the process .
Other officials , including Karl Rove , former Bush assistant , were criticized for not being cooperated during the investigation .
Meat Loaf receives a medal
The rock star Meat Loaf will be awarded the Q Awards Awards for the epic anthem " Bat Out Of Hell " .
The singer who will receive a special gold medal at the London ceremony next week said she would be honored .
The song was the song of Meat Loaf 's 1977 album , which was a success album .
Coldplay was nominated for the most awards this year , and was nominated in four categories .
Paul Rees , editor - in - chief of Q magazine , said , " There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres , and " Bat Out Of Hell " is like this . "
The song by Jim Steinman required a very high voice , and that voice was Meat Loafé .
The song began with a nearly two - minute instrumental section .
It was released as a single in 1979 , and reached number 15 on the charts .
However , Meat Loaf 's album " Bat Out Of Hell " was released on the charts for almost nine years , and then sold over 40 million copies .
Meat Loaf , actually Marvin Lee Aday , has been having health problems recently . Among other things , in 2003 , she had surgery due to arrhythmia after falling on stage .
In 2007 , he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute laryngitis .
Later , it turned out that he had cysts on his vocal chords .
Unknown metropolitan street , which is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenue , a tour and other side roads . Some of them are famous , others are merely performing a practical function .
However , many experienced taxi drivers and long - lived residents would find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is located , mostly because they have never heard of it .
The small street is in East Village , and it is heading north from First Street , without reaching Second Street , between Bowery and Second Avenue .
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long , and is much more like a dusty alley than a main transport route .
No street signs .
Technically , you ca n't find a standard map .
However , the street has admirers .
There it is , for example , Avalon Bay , a builder of recently built First Street luxury buildings .
He wants to re - cover Extra Place and make sure that the new buildings can be made in a cleaner way .
The street admirers include the long - lived neighbors caught in the broken street , that this was the only residue from the past before the renovation of the neighborhood .
However , the owner of the street , the building and development department of the city , does not have the right to insist .
This month , at a meeting of the District Government Spatial Management Committee , representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street .
However , the committee would prefer that the street remain in the city 's management and asked for a new plan for next month , reported by Susan Stetzer , District Manager of the Municipal Board No . 3 .
" There are very few areas in the city now , and we want Extra Place to remain in the city , " he said .
" We may discuss proposals for the renovation and treatment of Avalon , but we also want to guarantee that it remains accessible to the public . "
A few months ago Avalon Bay announced that they wanted to redecorate the small street and provide seats , some of which would be used by a cafe , the builder is expected to rent an area .
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first published in this month 's meeting .
Michele de Milly , spokesperson for Avalon Bay , said that although the company wants to use the street , it does not insist on its possession .
" Avalon Bay 's main aspect is to renovate this dirty alley and turn it into a pleasant public place , " he said , adding that the city proposed the purchase .
Seth Donlin , spokesperson for the Building Preservation Office , said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for building development and not for managing it .
Compared to his more colorful neighbor Bowery , Extra Place is not of much historical significance .
Some say he was named " Land of the Nobody " in hisz hisz when Philip Minthorne 's large estate was divided between his countless children and no one claimed the narrow land band .
The punk rock monument , which closed in 2006 , CBGB 's rear exit opened to Extra Place , and the street is perhaps the most famous of the photos of Ramones ' album " Rocket to Russia " .
" It was a great location , " said Danny Fields , the manager of Ramones , who took the photo in November 1976 .
" It was filled with garbage , garments , barrels and posters , and leaves and ropes . "
Some residents , including bloggers , who write about how they took over the middle class East Village , oppose the sale of Extra Place . They argue that this piece of public property , however modest , must remain in the possession of the community .
Others mention Extra Place as a rarity , which is a practically unchanged piece of the city , and which must be left alone .
Jeremiah Moss , author of the blog " The Book of Mirrors : The bitter nostalgia " , " The Book of Mirrors : The Process of the City 's Extreme Dying " , posted a part of the story about Extra Place , published in 1952 in the journal " The New Yorker " .
The author Brendan Gill wrote : " Extra Place is a narrow , small dead end , which is dark even during the day , bordered by rusty , iron - made storage doors and spalettic windows , and where the wind wears a week 's paper in the sewers . "
The street , apart from a few exceptions , looked the same a few nights ago .
A rat ran across the street , near the back door , which used to lead to CBGB , and now belongs to a higher - priced clothing store in its place .
On the walls there was graffiti , and a empty 0.75 litre beer bottle lay next to a dumped , fresh newspaper pile .
Some passers told me that they rarely think of Extra Place , but they think they could use the renovation .
Fields said that he said that some people underestimate his attraction to the current state of the street .
" I spent the best years of my life in dark , damp and disgusting places , " he said .
Discussion on bilingual education : Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this part of the Education Monitor Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates ’ views on bilingual education .
Lance T. Izumi , who is an experienced researcher in California studies and director of education research at the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute , is a co - author of the book " Not as good as you think : Why the Middle Class needs school choice " .
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish - speaking areas .
Barack Obama ’s education proposals include :
According to Obama 's campaign , " African - American and Spanish - speaking students are significantly less likely to earn a degree than white students , " and that 's true .
In order to combat such performance differences Obama ’s educational plan specifically supports , among others , " transient bilingual education " for English students .
However , the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education , which emphasizes education in non - English , is overcoming his interest in combating high performance differences .
Take , for example , Sixth Street Prep contractual primary school in the east of Los Angeles County .
Most of the students of the school are Spanish - speaking and low - income .
More than one third of students , many of whom have recently arrived , learn English .
However , 100 % of fourth grade students achieved an excellent result in the 2008 State Mathematics Exam .
Similarly , it is impressive that 93 % of fourth grade students have passed the English Language and Literature exam .
This incredible performance was not achieved by the device Obama would prefer .
 Sixth Sixth Street places emphasis on repetition , practice , continuous evaluation of skills and rejection of objections .
In addition , and this is what Obama should consider , according to Linda Mikels , the Sixth Street Director , the school 's educational principle is " fully immersed " English students into the language environment .
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of the English language during the teaching of other objects .
Mikels , who opposed bilingual education , said , " We have achieved overwhelming success in walking into a classroom , would not notice who was the student who arrived 12 months before from Mexico . "
" It works " - he said in the last place " it works for us . "
Would Obama set the schools like Sixth Street Prep as an example to follow ?
The results achieved by the school should be clear to the answer , but because of the education policy of its own party ( the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education ) and since they have consistently stood up to bilingual education themselves , we can not be sure of Obama ’s reaction .
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English , Obama recently said inestimatedly about the issue when he said that people should not worry so much about the " exclusive Englishness of the legislation " .
Instead , he said , " They should be able to get their children to speak Spanish . "
If Obama really wants to achieve a decrease in the differences between the results , he should seriously study models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them .
The price of oil dropped sharply due to the renewed concerns about the economy
On Monday , oil prices were steeply worried that America 's plan for a rescue mission for financial markets would not be able to revive the economy .
The crude oil securities fell down by seven percent to $ 99.80 this morning on the New York Trade Exchange .
Prices have dropped by over $ 20 per barrel since last Monday .
Over the past two weeks , commodities have been shaken by Wall Street financial turmoil and some powerful hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico .
After the prices reached $ 145.29 per barrel in July , at the beginning of this month , they dropped to almost $ 90 per barrel before they were re - influenced by the immense uncertainty of financial markets .
On Monday , concerns re - established investors even after Congress leaders announced that they had reached an agreement on the economic rescue operation , which is the largest in history .
The news was shaded by concerns that the financial crisis would not end for a long time .
As the latest event of the emerging crisis , Citigroup will buy up the banking business of Wachovia Corporation , announced by the government on Monday .
Meanwhile , the Belgian , Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially established the European financial conglomerate Fortis .
According to Barclays Capital analysts , as a result of desperate weekend negotiations , " it seems that the rescue mission failed to revive the stock trading spirit . "
As the economic situation deteriorates , it is expected that demand for commodities such as oil will also decrease .
" The future of the market for core shares , interest rates and currency exchange rates has become unsure worldwide , " said Deutsche Bank , an analyst for investors .
" We do n't think the market for commodities will be avoided by the pandemic . "
The biggest question for the commodity exchange is to what extent the USA 's " disease " infects the world , especially China . "
As oil consumption decreased due to the slowdown in economic growth , banks analysts cut their expectations for next year , reducing their forecast for oil and gas prices by 20 % for 2009 .
With the second quarter 's feat , the team set a record
After spending more time in the Jets jersey than anyone in the last eight seasons , Shaun Ellis , who played in defensive end positions , thought he had seen everything .
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday , when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match .
" I 've never seen anything like it , " Ellis said .
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona képzelatag was fully aligned with the dark clouds that were tower in the sky .
Brett Favre , quarterback gave Laveranues Coles 12-yard touchdown . This was the perfect forerunner for an afternoon in which their evolving cooperation was significantly improved .
Favre gave Coles two touchdowns in this quarter , including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half .
" I did n't feel sorry for the trouble , " he said to Fav about all Coles ' pass .
" He 's a hell of a player .
We have been able to communicate well with each other , regardless of what people think . "
While playing for Favre and Coles , the defense stopped the kiejt kiejt , Kurt Warner .
The cornerback player Darrelle Revis caught a bad shot and threw it back 32 yards , which hit touchdown .
Eric Smith , safety player reached another pass and got the ball .
David Bowens , linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner 's hand .
This last turn could have been the most amazing moment in the match .
However , when the szó szó lost the ball 10 seconds before the end , and the Jets scored , Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal , setting the 34:0 score .
This was the best result the Jets have achieved in a quarter .
When they asked the Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the mind - blowing nature of the game , he said , " Second or third quarter ? "
When they told him that both - in the third quarter the ördög won 21 points without the Jets getting one - Mangini said , " I have to tell you that the second quarter was much more enjoyable than the third .
We scored a lot of points in a short time . "
Rested Gebrselassie breaks its own world record
Aetiop Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many people consider the best mid- and long - distance runner ever to be when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday , making him the first to run 42.2 kilometres in 2 hours and 4 minutes .
With the conveniently flat track , with a victory in 2:03:59 , Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on her previous 2:04:26 , which she achieved last year in Berlin .
By the age of 35 , Gebrselassie had set the 26th world record for her career in so many areas that she had won the world record from 1500 metres to marathon in almost every run .
Last month , Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon , fearing that , looking back , it may have been too careful , that air pollution would further aggravate her asthmatic problems .
Instead , he entered the Berlin marathon .
In almost perfect conditions - in sunny weather , initially at 9 ° C , and at 13 ° C at the end - Gebrselassie won on Sunday , at an incredible speed of 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometer .
Since the marathon was not previously launched , such as Gebrselassie , and the Kenyan Paul Tergat turned towards longer distances , the marathon record has decreased by more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won 2:06:05 in 1998 in Berlin .
After Sunday 's victory , Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago , her legs cramped and could n't train for two weeks .
It is obvious that during the rest of the coercion , it was refreshed and not rusty .
" I am so happy , " Gebrselassie said to reporters .
" Everything was perfect .
I started training again a week ago , and today I had my doubts , but everything was fine . "
He received some criticism , especially from Kenya , Ethiopia ’s East African rival , that he uses too many tools during his competitions , usually avoiding many world - renowned marathon runners , relying on his cross - countryers as if he was running on a track and putting world records ahead of the competitive spirit .
However , this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie ’s greatness in long - term running .
Gebrselassie reached the half - point on Sunday with four Kenyan cross - countryers at 1:02:04 .
Two cutting - edge Kenyan runners , James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi , gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the cross - country runners were exhausted .
With a target of more than 4.8 kilometres , Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprinter , who finished second in 2:05:36 , 5 minutes in his personal best .
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48 .
In the women 's competition , Irina Mikitenko , born in Kazakhstan , now a German citizen , has a remarkable year in the seventh fastest , 2:19:19 .
The world record is held by Paula Radcliffe in Britain at 2:15:25 .
Last spring , 36-year - old Mikitenko won a surprise on the London marathon with 2:24:14 .
He was not allowed to participate in the Beijing Olympics due to his alleged back injury , but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin Marathon , where he improved five minutes at his personal peak .
He won the race with a smart calculation : he first allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership , and then he followed them after about 30 km of running .
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa was finished second in 2:21.31 , while Helena Kiprop in Kenya finished third in 2:25:01 .
A separate city , the pride and ordeal of black people
In the Greater Orlando experience park , a few miles from everything that shines , loud and huge , a quiet town is hidden where the pride and complications of African - American life are born .
Eatonville , the first purely black city to integrate into the country , and which was Zora Neale Hurston 's childhood home , is now not as simple as it was described in 1935 : " five lakes , three croquettes , 300 brown skin , 300 good floats , plenty of guaya and two schools , without jail . "
It 's a pilgrimage place now .
Alice Walker , Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been to the annual Zora Festival . The series of eatonville celebrations are held in honor of the most famous female writer Hurston of the Harlem Renaissance .
Still , in many ways , the city described and made a tourist attraction , which is also listed in the Florida guidebook published by the Project of the Federal Writers of the Crisis Age , is separated from its environment .
It was as independent , dignified and incarcerated as it was in the 1930s , when Hurston wrote that the Florida - based urban black people often refused to share their true thoughts with white people , who " knew so little about us that they did n't know what they were missing . "
Even in the year when black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages open discussions about race , many people are distrustful of the looks of outsiders .
" We are very careful how they tell our story " , said Hortense Jones , 59 , who lived here all his life and is a member of the oldest church in the city .
" You have to say it correctly . "
Eatonville has long been characterized by a paradox of victory and struggle .
At the same time , the black people are a historical model of their standings , but a community of almost 2400 people , where poverty indicators reach twice the national average .
It is a part literary hub , and partly an example of the American slavery , sometimes looked down , sometimes praised , southern , urban , black culture , blooming in the shade of oak trees .
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and defensive .
The picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora , ( everyone here calls Hurston ) .
In the sincere , strong dialect books , such as " Jules and Men " ( 1935 ) and " Their Eyes Were Watching God " ( 1937 ) , he introduced his hometown to the world .
Five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook transformed the city , which lies on Route 17 , leading Florida from its long - forgotten centre to one of the places in black history and human dramas .
Hurston , who was brave in both life and literature , even in drum roll , introduced his readers to the first mayor of Eatonville , Joe Clarke 's business , and then looked into the more trusted spheres .
He wrote , " From the road to the right we find modern public school , with a white corner on a brown background , carefully kept courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares for , though he can barely read and write . "
He mentioned the widow Dash 's new husband , and he wrote that Lee Glenn " sells all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in temporary accommodations . "
So , in a few hundred words , Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy , but also to illiteracy , re - marriage and sex .
It 's obvious that the veszélyes veszélyes 's guidebook was presented differently .
This description really did not please everyone .
" Zora told us the way they were , " said Ella Dinkins , 90 , one Johnson girl , made them immortal by quoting the silly songs that men sang about their beauty .
He added , " Some people did n't like it . "
Hurston is still remembered as the living freak who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville , Florida .
The 77-year - old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city , he usually arrived in a bumpy race without a announcement , smoking cigarettes , and long pants in a city where people still are proud of their dignified attire .
Most people were fascinated , Franklin said , but many were foreskin .
" People were always happy to see Zora , " Franklin said .
However , on the terrace facing Lake Sabelia , where Hurston was most likely baptized , swung in his chair , adding , " He never stayed too long . "
When Hurston died in 1960 , he was poor , and his books were no longer published .
It seemed that with most of the world , Eatonville had forgotten about it .
Although he was once a popular writer , Langston Hughes ' contemporary , and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s , was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce , Florida , where he lived before .
There were no significant memorials in Eatonville , or large public readings .
" I do n't think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us , " said Valerie Boyd , author of the book Hurston , published in 2003 , " The Rainbow . "
The turning point came in 1980 .
Orange County officials wanted to build a five - lane road through the city instead of the two - lane main street , Kennedy Avenue , which was an important part of the community 's life .
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the state - connecting Interstate 4 motorway on the western border of the city .
The proposal came when Eatonville was recovering after a difficult historic period .
Among other things , forced integration ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community .
In the 1950s , the fighting with the racial mixes tasted hatred with the community .
" At that time , a group of white boys came over and threw narzas and other things at the side of the road , " Franklin said .
" There was a lady who died in this .
They threw a watermelon out of a car . "
In a letter to the " The Orlando Sentinel " in 1955 , Hurston questioned the Supreme Court 's decision to impose a violent integration .
Today , residents say that while the desegregation of schools was positive in some respects , it weakened the cohesion of the Eatonville people and undermined the self - confidence of young people .
" Black children are used to hugging them - I remember -- man hugged his teacher in the morning and in the evening -- reported N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins , executive director of the nonprofit organization " Preservation of the Meg Eatonville Community " .
" This lasted as long as students and teachers were from a common place " , he added .
" We did n't hug our white teacher , because he was a white teacher -- I mean , there were cultural differences between us , " Nathiri said .
However , human rights have helped the rise of many other Zora Neale Hurston - in black writers , actors and artists who have risen above prejudices , as he did , with such optimistic self - confidence and ranks as the next : " How can anyone deprive themselves of the enjoyment of my company !
This is incomprehensible to me . "
In 1975 , Alice Walker piled on Hurston 's unmarked tomb and began to fight to return her reputation .
Five years later , a Hurston biography written by Robert E. Hemenway was placed on the shelves of bookstores , which again brought him to the role models of America .
The road construction project was just about to start when Eatonville 's most famous daughter was back in the center of attention .
And this time Hurston 's old neighbors saw him as a savior .
The community began to organize a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the county would destroy with its main road .
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening event two years later , and many have returned to the ceremony every January .
A few years later , the county stopped its proposal to build a road .
" The five - laneization of the main road made the community resuscitate , and it went at full speed , which means real civic pride , " Nathiri said .
Boyd put it more simply : " Zora saved Eatonville . "
The victory over the road construction project helped change the city ’s image of itself .
There was an increasing number of people outside the city , such as lawyer Rachelle Munson , who started coming to church in 1993 , and the locals began to reevaluate the past .
Eatonville was listed in 1998 as a national historical list .
In 2006 , the new one - storey library ( naturally named Hurston ) opened on the re - encased and beautified Kennedy Avenue .
Eatonville remains Florida 's thyme : it is not exactly ten kilometers from Orlando 's centre , but sometimes it feels like a suburban back street in the summer rain ; it is as small as when 27 black families founded it in 1880s .
( Today 90 % of the population is black . )
They still take caution in the outsiders who come here looking for Eatonville 's story , to say what they 're saying .
Most interviews require a prior authorization , and some things , such as Eatonville 's oldest fresco , which a white man painted and represents black people working in the fields , should not be photographed .
Many people in Eatonville , including the confident Jones teacher , who is particularly attracted to bright red , are afraid that their separate communities will be misunderstood .
And yet , as the Hurston Festival became wider , the pride of its hometown grew .
In particular , young people increasingly regard Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race : wonderful , with his problems and everything , neither better nor worse , equally proud , creative , diligent , foolish and confused , as well as other racial and ethnic groups in America .
An honest civil bond is heard from Franklin 's nephew , 18-year - old Edwin Harvey , who plans to return after graduating from college to work with the local government or the police , which he believes will need help .
And it seems that the younger ones have learned to describe Eatonville correctly , such as the 11-year - old Winter Park twins : Alondra and Alexia Kenon .
" Most people who just travel through here think this city is nothing compared to the others , " said Alondra Kenon recently , after the service on Sunday .
" But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know his history , then it 's a very nice city . "
We all speak the language of finance here in New York City
Nothing on the surface has changed .
If tourists did n't care about the newspaper stand and the giant television showers in Times Square , they would n't notice they 're in the middle of a storm .
They would never realize that bankers and risk fund managers , who have been in control of New York , have been living the hardest days since 1929 .
The couriers are still rattling their metal teaspoons through the sidewalks , carrying cupcakes for morning meetings .
There are still men with Spanish lips hanging between the blocks , carrying 50-something sockets of mule , hanging on a loops of yoke on their shoulders .
Office workers are still waiting in line for their breakfast sweet pastries at the food carts on the sidewalk , and it is still impossible to catch a taxi on weekdays between 4 and 7 .
I did n't feel like any crisis until Thursday afternoon , despite all the bad news , I decided to open a new bank account .
Although I deliberately planned to do this in the afternoon 's rest of the day at the local branch of my bank JP Morgan Chase , I had about 20 people in line .
Not at the banking banking window , where you can pick up or deposit money , but at the customer service counter , where older customers order checkbooks , tourists ask for directions to the Macy 's store , and where new customers open a bank account .
Many of them , I learned later from Starr , the banker of my " order " , were lined up with the same intention as me .
However , unlike me , they already took their money out of smaller banks in their homes , such as New Jersey , Pennsylvania and Staten Island .
They took money out of the so - called savings banks ( which are like home - building cooperatives ) from credit associations and small - town savings banks that operate only in one state and supposedly treat their clients as family members .
15 banks have been destroyed quietly in the last year .
In recent days , Washington Mutual , a bank with a capital of $ 327 billion , was placed under bankruptcy care , and when New Yorkers left for the weekend , another bank , Wachovia , earned a bank savings of $ 440 billion , to buy out .
The office and shopkeeper ahead , fearing another collapse , transferred their money to a bank that seemed like a safe haven , a bank that does most of the capital - injections on Wall Street .
The simple people in New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks .
A woman on her phone at the local Chinese store said she was bankrupt from Lehman Brothers Bank and her huge - looking CEO Dick Fuld , as if she were complaining about a lazy colleague .
And Lyn , the janitor of my apartment 's block , who 's been in uniform for 50 years , has changed the subject , not Brad and Angelina , or my food delivery , as we always have .
He said to me after I went to the bank : " I invested all my savings in money market assets .
I 've changed , I 'm not taking any chances . "
Muzhen graves were abused while Austria tilted to the right
Heinz - Christian Strache , from the right - wing Austrian Freedom Party , and Filip Dewinter , from the Belgian right - wing party Vlaams Belang , participated in a protest in Antwerp on Thursday , January 17 , 2008 , on which the organization " The Conquest of Islam " was introduced .
They were drawn with signs of traffic signs that represented mosques crossed by red lines .
According to the police , extremists on the far right are responsible for the abuse of Muslim cemeteries in Austria , which occurred on the same weekend when the far right parties were significantly advanced in the national parliamentary elections .
There was a serious damage to over 90 graves in the traunal cemetery near Linz , sometime between Friday evening and this morning .
The perpetrators used paint sprayers to draw Jewish symbols , such as a David star on some tombs , but investigators say that they were merely trying to hide their extreme motives , which are due to hatred against Muslim immigrants .
It is unclear whether the incident is related to the elections in some way .
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that they were " deeply shaken " in the sound of the tombs of the Muslim religious month , shortly before the end of Ramadan .
Meanwhile , Austria will conduct a conscience test after the parliamentary elections yesterday , during which the language of the political balance sheet was tilted to the right .
The two far - right parties , which gained almost 30 % of the votes , were campaigning for the future of Austria , a highly anti - immigration law , and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic .
Heinz - Christian Strache , President of the Freedom Party , who acquired more than 18 % of the votes , expressed his displeasure against the campaign against the headwear and burkets , and also against the alleged foods associated with Islam .
The party spoke at its final meeting in Vienna about the " European brotherhood " , which helps prevent the strengthening of Islam .
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets , arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing impersonation of Austria and Europe .
Public polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election that won the far - right , said that change was due to the largely young voting base , who are concerned about their future in the European Union .
Garry Glitter was banned from a trip abroad
Garry Glitter , a known rock star convicted of sexual assault of children , was banned from his trip to France and Spain .
The judges decided to ban Glitter six months after notifying the authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France .
The police in Kent obtained a ban on travel by Thursday after submitting evidence of rape convictions against Glitter against children .
Glitter , real name Paul Gadd , was not involved in the trial of Ashford Magistrates , but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers .
A court spokesperson said , " On Thursday , 25 September , the police of Kent filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court for the prevention of Paul Gadd 's trip to France and Spain on 25 March .
Paul Gadd did n't show up in person .
64-year - old Glitter informed the authorities of his foreign travel intent because he is bound by the law on the registers of sex offenders .
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days .
You must also notify the police at least seven days before you leave .
If you do not notify the authorities , you may be sentenced to five years imprisonment .
The Kenti police said they did n't want to discuss any of his individual cases in Glitter County and his whereabouts .
We learned from the spokesperson for the police in Kent : " The police in Kent are doing everything they can to protect children within the country and abroad .
" We think it 's easier to check someone if they do n't leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system to manage potential risks more effectively .
" The most important task of theenti police is to protect the population of Kent . We continuously monitor the behaviour of people in the records of sex offenders and people living in the county to minimize possible risks to the population . "
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year - old girl .
After his release , he flew to Bangkok , where he was supposed to board a plane to London .
However , he claimed to feel bad and refused to fly to London .
The authorities in the country refused to pass the passport test , so he flew to Hong Kong .
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter the country , so they flew back to Bangkok , where the officials of the Land police and immigration office insisted on returning to Britain .
Finally , he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there until his attorney David Corker went to the Court of West London , Uxbridge , because he was registered in the register of perpetrators of sexual offences under a court order in accordance with Scotland Yard 's request .
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the UK for possession of photographs of child rape in 1999 .
According to a source from the Home Office , Jacqui Smith , Minister of Interior , welcomed Glitter with comfort and joy that he was not allowed to go to France and Spain .
" I do n't take pictures on stage because I want to introduce the artist on a personal basis "
No set , no hair , no dancing shoes .
The masters of flamenco from close range , without the excitement of the performance : to get to know the everyday face of dancers .
On the one hand , the artist .
On the other hand , the ordinary man .
And these two sides can not be separated , except in moments far from the intimate audience , when we can fall on a personal motion , grab the depths of a caught eye , or wonder at the beauty of the idle but expressive hand of the artist who is not on stage .
In the German photo series Günther Bauer Flamenco -people , the Teatrality of singers , dancers and guitarists is combined with this less known everyday side of the masters .
Through the photos , the peculiar iconography of flamenco is presented from different angles .
The exhibition , which is part of the month of Flamenco Photography , reflects the growing international importance of flamenco from day to day , " says the creator , adding that the character of Flamenco -people could be anyone , since the observer , when seeing the images , realized that these images are not typical of artists .
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion , sadness , joy to the stage and captivate the audience .
However , stage photography is not suitable for the capture of their personality .
Their personality and character are in the very depths of their being .
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco with the camera . "
The Cante de las Minas festival was launched in 1997 by Bauer , which produced a series of portraits of flamenco singers , guitarists and dancers .
Thanks to the camera and the choice of topics , these portraits quote classical photography .
The following idea reflects Bauer ’s idea of flamenco faithfully : “ This is a music with traditional roots , which , however , changes from day to day and is always fascinating . ”
Not dancing , not singing or music alone , but rather the personality of the artist , his character makes the audience feel better .
These days , the main motivation of the works that can be viewed in the El Fotomata gallery is to find the connection with artistic magic , which is visible through perception , existence and the way of visualization .
The known figures of flamenco , including Diego El Cigala , Chano Lobato , Cristina Hoyos , Enrique Morente , El Lebrijano , Antonio Canales , Vicente Amigo , are the hallmarks of this photo collection of sixty artists .
The project also became a flamenco -antology , which will soon be released with an album covering portraits presented at the exhibition .
Bauer 's passion for portraits has been pushing him to repeat the idea with the series " Portrait of Veteran athletes " ( " SportsARTproject " ) .
Although the concept of Flamenco -people is slightly different from this , the photographer adds : " I love to photograph people , get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment .
In my opinion , the most difficult genre of photography is portrait .
You meet people , you meet people , you get a lot of personalities that you do n't even know sometimes , or who just take a few minutes to take pictures .
But even in these circumstances , as a photographer , I always try to realize my ideas .
The exhibition , Flamenco -people , is selected from the portraits of contemporary flamenco , can be seen in El Fotómata Gallery , which is parallel to Alameda de Hércules , in the Calle de la Mata 20 , until 16 October .
Vargas Llosa says the novel he 's working on is " recklessness . "
The scene and the plot are still unknown to him , but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing his novel . The protagonist of the novel is an Irish nationalist , Roger Caseman , who lived twenty years in the Congo and Amazonia .
The Nobel Prize for Literature writer at the Hay Festival Segovia event yesterday admitted that his current work was " ready - made recklessness " and " all signs show that it should not be written " the novel .
" If I were smarter , I would n't , but I will do it , and I hope I can get to the end of it sometime , " he said , with these words , at the festival of ideas , thoughts and opinions , which received thousands of writers , historians and journalists in Aqueduct for four days , and thousands of visitors .
The author of the " city and dogs " was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature and has also replaced the hopes of it .
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants , an old edition of Dickens 's novel " Our mutual friend " .
The public was soon taken by the public , during which the writer in Peru told a wonderful memory and a great deal of humor about how his special adventure of reading and the vocation of the writer of the desire to live life was formed ; how he would bridge the lack of inspiration with a disciplined writing method , diligent documentation , much repair and rewrite ; how he influenced the vocation of writers Faulkner , Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas , and what memories his stories would be based on .
The Latin American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives , but added : " I do not think literature is mere entertainment or a life of a flower " , because it affects people and makes them think , so he asked writers not to allow the temptation of lightness and to be held accountable for their profession .
The weather is shorter than the farewell of Pozoblanco , the horse bullfights are also cancelled
The horse bullfighting , traditionally held as the closing of the Pozoblanco holidays , was cancelled yesterday morning after the future horse torreadors found the arena 's terrain unsuitable for the tournament .
As a result , the Committee decided to cancel the bullfight with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez , Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández .
The weather conflicts have thoroughlyépépéped the series of celebrations , since two of the three events could not be held .
The second bullfight was missed on Saturday because of the rain .
The future characters , José Luis Moreno , Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista , would have fought with Castilblanco bulls .
So they only had bullfight on Friday .
The winner Daniel Luque , brought home three ears as a trophy , and was brought around after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle .
On the same afternoon , Alejandro Talavante gained a number of awards and trophies , but it was more than his own performance .
However , El Juli followed , who had little contribution to the old ageing of the Los Llanos Arena .
After a comfortable ride with the second bull , the audience managed to get most of the audience out of their minds .
Inlava , a van carrying two tons of hashish tried to escape road control
Four o'clock at the morning , fifty minutes .
The Basque Territorial Police is conducting traffic control in the administrative area of Armiñón (Álava ) .
The authorities will stop a van in which two people travel , and the passengers will try to escape the action .
The shipment , over two tons of hashish , was not conspicuous .
The investigators chased the passengers and one of them , a 28-year - old man was arrested and identified as A.A. J. , the Basque Government Department of Homeland Affairs said .
The man who was captured is charged with drug trafficking and forged documents .
The case took place in the administrative area of Armiñón , where the employees of the Álavai Traffic Inspectorate carried out a traffic check on the N-1 motorway .
When they tried to stop the van , the driver refused to obey , gave me a sudden gas , and then left the scene of the inspection .
The detectives chased him , and then the vehicle stopped a few kilometers off the stop lane , and his passengers fled from the highway to a forest area .
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them , and after reviewing the Iveco Daily van , they seized its shipment , 2178 kilograms of hashish .
The hashish balls filling the rear of the vehicle were transported by police authorities to take a more thorough investigation and measure the drug .
In addition , the inspection proved that the vehicle 's fake license plate does not match the data in the van 's papers , and therefore the arrest is brought to justice for theft of a public document .
The Basque Regional Police continue the investigation , which aims to arrest the other suspect , who , as mentioned above , fled the highway and , on the other hand , to determine the origin of the seized drug .
The 28-year - old accused A.A.J. was transferred to the police for the necessary interrogations , and within a few hours the court measures began .
They arrested actress Heather Locklear for driving under medication .
Heather Locklear , the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series , was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara ( California ) during the weekend because she was under the influence of drugs .
A witness said he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange manoeuvres , said a spokesperson for People magazine in California .
Witness said that he was pushing the gas to the " floor " at around 16:30 , crying on the engine , trying to leave the parking lot in the front and back , and going through his sunglasses several times in reverse . "
Shortly after , the witness who probably did not recognize the actress , saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car .
He also informed the police because he was worried about Locklear 's life .
When the police arrived , the actress was in her car , which partially paralyzed the traffic of the highway .
" He seemed distracted , " so the patrol took him to a drug and alcohol testing center specializing in this .
According to a police spokesperson , the actress was cooperative and the alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded . The spokesperson also said that , based on the first impression of officers , they believed that she was under the influence of Locklear .
Locklear was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified substance . Around 19:00 , he was taken to the local prison , where he was released a few hours later .
Locklear came out of a sanatorium in Arizona two months ago , where his anxiety and depression were treated .
Llamazares calls on the Federation of IU ( United Left ) andalusians to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares , Secretary General of the IU and the representative of the United Left , today stated that the regional federation of the Corps will make a decision regarding the former Youth and Sport Advisor of the Sevilla Municipality , Francisco Manuel Silva . Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to bring his family members to benefits .
“ I am a federalist in these matters , and this case is certainly within the jurisdiction of the Andalusian organization , ” Llamazares pointed out that the party must apply to the former member of the city council in sevilla .
On the other hand , the President of the IU stressed that in the detection of irregularities that Silva may have committed , the “ transparency ” should be borne in mind : “ At IU has always been on the plane to ensure that such matters are maximally transparent . ”
He added that the training is part of the " strict code of ethics for public servants . "
" May blood " , the epic work of Garci
Benito Pérez 's work entitled " National episodes of Galdós " inspired José Luis Garci , who evokes the famous anti - French rebellion of the Spanish in May blood , which , with the budget of nearly € 15 million , is the greatest piece of his filmography .
Accordingly , the director attempted to illustrate the human flow and social analysis in the work of the novelist known .
More than two and a half hours of May blood will be presented in the movies on Friday , and later Telemadrid will screen it as a miniseries in a range exceeding four hours .
José Luis Garci , a great admirer of Galdós ’s office , made his childhood dream of filming . All this was due to Esperanza Aguirra , who commissioned him three years ago from Madrid Province to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on 2 May. Garci accepted the invitation on condition that the story was based on the National Epparagraphs .
The 15 million budget was entirely financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid , and Garci had a special opportunity to present it with a contemporary set and costume " the confused Spanish people who had mistakenly stood up to the wrong leader , because the struggle for independence pushed the country to a great level of decline with the reign of Ferdinand VII , " he said .
The director apologized for not counting the budget of more than double - kicking Alatriste or Goya 's phantom . For this reason , he was forced to skip a few scenes from the script , which , like many others , was recorded along with Horacio Valcárcel .
So the director of the Restart resorted to his usual way of working , he recorded scenes with actors he had already started rehearsals with before filming . Casting did not , because Garci thought it " humiliating " , and because , as he said , " the director 's profession is part of the theater and cinema to find out what is going on in the industry in which we work . "
Several actors of May blood , such as Miguel Rella , Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo , have not entered the camera for the first time .
Garci , who boasts four Oscar candidates and an Oscar award , believes that the candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy , namely May blood , Seven French billiards tables and finally selected blind sunflowers , are not representing the young generation of Spanish cinema , " where should be presented " , he said .
Garci does n't expect awards with this movie .
" Initially you think you work for posterity , and then you realize that it 's only about getting along , and finally you 're glad if you have another movie , " says Garci , with 30 years of professional career behind her .
Isabel Bayón evokes the life and art of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Florenco dancer from Seville is also a memory of a Seville dancer .
Carmen Tórtola Valencia , born in Triana , was born in the Triana district and moved to London at the age of three .
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dance .
During his busy life , he fought as a pioneer for female equality , whether it was Isadora Duncan , Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt .
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing a corset that inhibits the freedom of women 's movement .
He started a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe , and his life was astonishing Isabel Bayón .
" I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa , she recommended to me Tórtola , whose personality really impressed me . "
The flamenco dancer said , " We are not here to tell her life story , but to capture her spirit .
I thought of flamenco styles about the titles of his dances .
For example , the " dance of the lashes " on guajira or " dancing of the snake " is tango .
" She danced sensibly and others think it 's my style , " she says .
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors : Miguel Poveda is now singing again after the Open Door at Isabel ’s performance ; and Matilde Coral , who in this case , had an exception to work with an earlier student .
" Matilde plays the older Torta , the mature woman .
I am happy that you said yes to the invitation , it is very honor to perform in my play . "
In addition , the production includes music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga , Miguel Ortega , el Pulga and Moi de Morón ; El Pájaro , batman Rafa El Viola , and actor Juanfra Juárez , who " plays a constant character who constantly attacks the true diva with his love . "
The play also shows the life of a woman who lives in London , but also travels to Europe , and also reaches far away regions , including India , the United States or Italy .
" I wanted to remind him because his personality had a great impact on his own age , but nowadays he is no longer known and much less appreciated in his work , " says Bayón .
The show starts at 20:30 tonight at Lope de Vega .
By the end of the Triennium , the diary of a newlyweds poet will also appear .
The first illustrated edition of the Diary of A newlyweds poet will be presented at Saint Stephen 's Church ( New York ) , where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobiia . The presentation is part of the series of programs entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium ( 2006 - 2008 ) , organized by the Regional Government Cultural Committee of Andalusia on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize award of Literature and the anniversary of their death .
In this way , Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium are the finalakkor of the work , the International Congress , the restoration of the memory house of Nobel Prize - winning poet and the “ Juan Ramón Jiménez : The Bright Summer Tree ” exhibition . This year , the exhibition opened in May , visited several andalusian provinces and is scheduled to visit New York for the duration of the International Congress .
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government acquired eight hundred copies of the diary of a newlywed poet , which was illustrated by Jacobo Pérez - Enciso , who published Perdo Tabernero and illustrated it to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets .
Without Paul Newman , America is n't so attractive .
" God sometimes has perfect people in his room .
Paul Newman was like that . "
The quote came from actress Sally Field , who worked with Newman in the film " Victims of Sensation " , and reflects the shock and helplessness that Newman 's death caused in the American cinema industry and throughout America .
How hard he got the Oscar .
He retired in 2007 ,
and he was known to be ill ,
But still , everyone was shaken by their death .
" Sometimes it is impossible to put our feelings into words , and I have lost a good friend , " said Robert Redford , " " his existence has made my life and this country better . "
No one was afraid that it might become ridiculous or overdo it .
One of the heroes of cinema and home went out in a particularly dark period , shaded by terrorism and fear of market conditions , desperate search for American self - esteem and dignity .
When times are so difficult and many people lose their virtues easily and there are very few people we can look up to , you do n't have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman .
In the eyes of the people , he embodied the platonic beauty and justice .
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and a protector of lost and won cases , ranging from the anti - drug foundation established in memory of his first - born son , who died of drug overdose , to the creation of a home - based bio - food brand .
It was a real gift to a country that could hardly transcend its suicide nutrition culture .
My overwhelming admiration wave has traveled all of Hollywood , regardless of nationalities and origins .
The last James Bond , the Englishman Daniel Craig , said he was n't a man , but an era died with him .
Another Englishman , Oscar winner Sam Mendes , said that his work with Newman clearly meant the highlight of his career .
Russell Crowe , the bad guy from Australia , called Newman " the greatest inspiration . "
" He set the bar very high for all of us " , said George Clooney , who may be one of the few who today attempt to follow Paul Newman 's lifestyle : they require honesty and privacy far from serious and camera .
It 's not always easy , if it 's possible in the midst of the media jungle today .
Yet some people try , and Paul Newman is his role model .
He was divorced once , but then he lived in a loyal marriage with Joanne Woodward for fifty years , and he certainly would have had many opportunities for infidelity .
" Why should I eat hamburgers elsewhere when the roast meat is at home ? " - he was joking .
In heaven , you can be proud that girls on earth are also fans , which is not very common in America .
" None of his performances were as proud as his faithful husband , loving father , caring grandfather and devoted philanthropist role , " they say .
The Matched Way of the Madrid Olympics
Many of us have dreams of a Madrid Olympics , and after 2012 failed , it may turn into 2016 .
But , I ask , are we really prepared for this ?
Because if we 're gon na start yesterday 's running race , I do n't think we 're gon na get it .
They called it the perfect contest , but in my opinion , it was the worst of many I 've ever been to .
It was characterized by a crowd of senselessness , and once it was appreciated , and I would be the exam room , clearly failing .
But let 's get started first and start at the beginning .
The senselessness began with the takeover of the serial number , because this meant that it had to arrive earlier .
This is not a problem in itself , but if you go faster , at least get everything at once ( including the chip , to avoid a job later ) .
That 's not what happened .
The first time only the number was given ( first pointlessness , only to go there earlier ) and ( after the usual line ) what a surprise , only a S - shirt ( second pointlessness , because I have XL size ) !
What kind of world do we live in ?
Or did they decide to save on the material because of the crisis and buy only cheaper , small T - shirts ?
But anyway , these things still break up compared to what happened on the day of the race .
Beyond the fact that we had to go there awfully early to pick up the chip , the queue lasted 15 minutes from the arrival and even the backpack had to be delivered .
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes , which is incomprehensible in a running race with more than 11,000 people .
So , as expected , the race started , and we have n't given up the backpack yet .
In addition , the rain made the waiting more than 40 minutes more pleasant , which was covered by popular uprising and stand - attack attempts .
I think that about 500 people will get pneumonia tomorrow , and some of us , including myself , will not be getting our place in actual time .
If you ask me about the perfect running race , I would n't happen to think of that .
So I think we can continue our dream of a well - prepared Olympic city .
Looking for a Microsoft ( virtual ) Receptionist
At MIT Emerging Technologies Conference , Microsoft presented a new image recognition and human interaction system , a kind of - not very intelligent - artificial intelligence that can , however , perform some basic tasks . For example , it can call a taxi ( or a vehicle in the company area ) based on information heard from the conversation .
This " Reception " can detect how many people are in the room , who are - in fact , notes what clothes they wear in the house , and also hears and understands the key words of their conversations .
In addition , you can group the people present based on the conversations .
In the presentation video , the receptionist lady identifies a third person , but knows that she is not a member of the company talking to her and is not an employee of the company .
He asks if he came to see someone and assures them that he will soon come to his aid .
All without the blue big screen .
Impressive .
But this is the music of the future , of course .
At present , the company has more important things to do , such as developing a new version of Windows operating system .
Many people said this week that Microsoft was changing strategies .
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer additional programs .
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running only the necessary programs instead of the commercial trash , the machines would be five times faster - bravo , Steve , that 's something .
They invented the Spanish wax , considering that Microsoft has attached additional features and extensions to Windows in every new version so far .
The change of direction will be paid .
Microsoft is right , the operating system is becoming more and more out of control , and software itself .
When Google Chrome appeared on the web , I joined the theory that Google took the first step to becoming a competitor for Windows .
Many people correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system .
The operating system will always be needed , as it is an essential element for the dialogue between hardware and software .
You 're playing the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother - in - law .
That 's right .
It will never disappear , but it is necessary to calculate the " death " of the operating system , not in absolute , but in relative terms .
Ballmer 's statement this week is a supportive idea .
People are paying less attention to the operating system and more and more attention to the web browser .
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and there is more and more time spent on browsing than we spend in the world of windows .
What is the most part of the application that comes with the system ?
Less is sometimes more .
And Windows 7 must be less , much less than Vista .
Less difficult , less overwhelmed , less complicated .
Microsoft aims to integrate its services online and ultimately to be an alternative to Google .
They need this very much , so I 'll give you an example of why .
I took this photo in a lounge for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month in Redmond .
On the soda machine , a poster calls them up to use the company 's browser .
In 2006 , an independent investigation found that 66 % of Microsoft workers used Google to browse the web .
Anyway , last week , the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced to be slipping .
It does n't arrive in early 2009 , but at the end , and moreover , in 2010 .
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together .
The mobile phone is increasingly a computer .
But the slide , considering that Android and iPhone are already on the market , will make their business worse .
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This is what Pablo Picasso wore in the Costa Azulon , Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick 's Blood Diamond , and Al Pacino in Francis Ford 's Coppola Godfather , and this is also one of the basic clothes of the mass of gay customers .
And speaking of specialties , we might as well remember the frog figure of the wandering circus ' kacky mustache weightlifter .
But what are we talking about ?
That is , the " tank " , as the English - speaking call it , but with Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles , no competition can be made .
First of all , because of its elegant name - although among friends it is referred to as "Marcel " , which is due to the sport , according to legend Marcel Cerdan was named after the boxer , singer Edith Piaf .
Marcel is also distinguished by its excellent cotton material , unisex tailoring , its unique emblem and its small Belgian flag .
But the Belgian company does n't just make tank tops .
Sports tops , retro boxers , cashmere swords , wool pants , seafarers , baby clothes , minisortoks - and even list - are all products of the company .
And they 're all in the category of comfortable underwear ,
It is unfortunate to wear them as underwear .
They 're too good for that .
" I want to be a young mother , no matter who the father is "
He is very similar to his brother , but he managed to achieve himself .
Monica Cruz is small and fragile , but full of energy .
Currently , the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world .
For Monica , modeling means more than some pretty and pretty girls give their names to something .
He was present at the promotion of Mango 's new headquarters in Paris and the handover of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company .
It is a very good place to live .
What are you doing in Paris ?
We present the Mango 's new autumn - winter collection , which my brother and I have planned with Penelope . In addition , we will attend the announcement of the second competition of the ' mango Fashion Awards ' and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera .
It 's a busy day , but it 's very exciting .
This is your fourth season at Mango . Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection ?
We both love the cinema of the ' 50s and ' 60s ; we took a lot of things from there .
And then , I often go around town and I watch women dress , how they change and sort out their clothes -- that 's one of my favorite pastimes .
You also work as a dancer , actress and fashion designer .
I think so , but after all , these three things are connected , because they have a lot in common .
I was interested in clothes when I was little , and I could n't wait to go to my grandmother 's and go through my aunt 's wardrobe .
Now , that was you on Canaan , almost up in an amusement park .
And then as a dancer , I always tried to watch my dress .
You know , we dancers like to invent our own style for hours and rehearsals , to have fun looking in the mirror .
And in the actress role , you really identify with your role when you get the costume .
See , everything is connected to everything , and with all due respect to designers and their expertise .
You just celebrated your 30th birthday .
No , no , no , no , no .
I feel better than ever , I like the 30s .
I think that 's what women are really worth , they 've had enough experience and make fewer mistakes in life .
And the biological clock does n't worry me .
I 've been doing what I want since I was a kid , and it makes me feel very happy inside .
And do you want to be a mother or not ?
Of course , I know I 'm gon na be a mother because I was born to be a woman , and I 'd like to be a young mother , and I certainly do n't want to miss that .
As for the future father , no matter who it is .
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love .
Let 's drop a few words about the movie , you made several movies last year that have n't been presented yet .
Yeah , and I ca n't wait to get them out .
I , who started in the theater , am very impatient and anxious , I want everything immediately , but of course I know that it is impossible .
I ca n't wait to be presented to you the last hour and the search for the tomb of Christ .
I wonder what you 'd think of them .
I understand you made your debut on the runway a few days ago with Naomi Campbell .
No , that 's not true .
I did n't go up to the runway as a model .
I 've known Naomi Campbell for a long time , and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London , directed for her own organization called " Women for a Better World . " I chose two of her own Mango collections .
People do n't even know how good - hearted Naomi is .
They talk so much about him , I know him , and I can assure you , half of it is n't true .
On the other hand , I always look on the bright side of your work .
He asked me to do a fashion show for a noble cause , but if he wanted me to stand on his head , I would do the same .
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake , I do n't know the impossible .
The back - up drunk drivers will be ordered to install " Alcolock "
After three drunk driving violations , the Ministry of Interior would order the car driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver was drunk or did not blow into the structure .
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being addressed by the State 's Attorney 's Office , which says that the pilot project will last for a year .
Since the aim of the project is to restore the market , the car driver will also have to take part in a repeat course on transport education .
In addition to the Public Prosecutor ’s Office for Transport Safety , the Directorate - General for Transport ( DGT ) and the Institute for Autoboszsági Technology Foundation ( FITSA ) are also involved in the experiment .
According to statistics , 30 - 75 % of the drivers arrested repeatedly for driving drunks are back in the car .
Alcolock would prevent this , since the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air in the air . If it is larger than the permissible , or if the driver did not blow into the device at all , the system will not allow the car to start .
The cost of the instrument of more than € 1000 would be borne by the offender .
A study conducted in the USA in 2007 proved that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of violations by up to 65 % in the first year after installation .
In Spain , it is estimated that 115 people could be saved every year by this rule .
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons : on the one hand , it is easier to prevent them from becoming a crime ,
On the other hand , it is easier to introduce it , since the implementation of the legal reform takes place in the usual medier , while the necessary criminal reform requires a basic amendment to the law .
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market , although it has already been installed in experimental mode in some industrial and public service vehicles .
The Assembly votes tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers ' Party which calls for the installation of the system in school buses .
In Mexico , in closed shoes
At 17:40 pm , the Spanish Air Force Prince Party of Asturias landed at the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City .
The sun was already in the air , but it was still so set that we could only see the royal party coming out of the plane using our hands as eye sensors .
At the foot of the stairs were the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities .
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street , did he know that the Spanish Prince couple was coming to town for official visits ?
- Well , good , then there 's no airport transfer for a while .
- No , no , sir , she 's Spanish , she just lived here for a few years .
- Yeah , or so .
But the Mexican press , they know all about the Prince of Asturias and the significance of their visitation .
Many are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar , the cordon of 27 sailors who are protecting dignitaries .
The Prince appears , smiling , in a sea blue dress , and then the Princess , in her long hair , she gets caught in a windy dress , but not in the usual shoes that flash her toes - maybe they warned her that Mexico City was threatened by a storm .
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras , and then they enter the room where the official reception is coming .
They are at the gates of their hotel , one of the four largest hotels in the city , a reporter of Mexican television .
The most valuable fashion prize
The most suitable place for the transfer of a fashion prize is undoubtedly Paris , and Valentino is among the most sophisticated and the coolest of fashion designers living today .
Mango recently announced the second competition of the El Botón - Mango Fashion Awards , which aims to introduce the international awareness of young talent in fashion .
The main prize is 300,000 euros .
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli , the Belgian winner of the first contest , saw her own designer clothes in the Mango window at the boulevard Haussmann 54 in Paris , and almost made tears of touch .
By the way , this is the second largest European business in the company and has recently opened on 1335 square meters .
The biggest business is in London .
In the midst of the many events and thanks to Valentine , the jury , we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris .
The president 's table of the gala dinner prepared by Mango was even more spectacular with the most enjoyable Chagalok .
Nati , who , due to his recent death , came with a heavy heart and sadness , wore a piece of the Company and some breathtaking gems of the ELAH .
Andik , the owner and host of Mango , had a good time . Together with Baron Rotchil , they were so chivalrous that they eventually remained without a suit , because they were both given to a lady .
Monica Cruz arrived in the store in her own designer pants and shirts , and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress . At the night opera visit to Gaya Toledo , she was so caught up in the ballet room , she was able to recall the old days and she went down to one of the bars and improvised a grand plie .
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit , but before that , he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone .
The next morning we were delighted in Oliver Martinez - he 's about two meters tall and he 's on a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris .
Stars under the starry sky of Paris .
Oh là là , c'est la vie .
1001 , the stress - solving number
There are not 1,000 , but 1,000 and one way to turn off the chaotic and messy everyday life .
And the good news is that we can find them all in one book that arrives at the bookstores on 30 September to bring peace .
It 's almost torture to ring at 7:00 a.m. , but it 's even worse to think about how fast it 's going to take me to live every day .
The office 's called a voltage , and the computer 's got a back pain .
Stress is the people 's disease of the 21st century .
But to overcome daily exhaustion and bridge problems at work is not one and there are not two ways .
No , that number is exactly one of 1001 .
In addition to yoga positions , classical massage or " spa " treatments , Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book , so that everyone can find the most pleasant and free - to - use solution .
The stress - solving work is called the 1001 relaxation method and the tranquility of it comes from Pearson Alhambra y DK to bookstores .

If you 're too low to refresh your adrenaline levels and you 're having a stress problem , it 's time to sit back in the chair , relax and focus on reading .
Those who speak in their sleep
Some kids talk at night .
I do n't mean people who wake up and tell them what happened to them that day , but those who talk while they 're sleeping .
The phenomenon may seem scary at first , but it 's actually completely harmless .
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus .
It is quite common , especially among children and adolescents .
I 'm sure they 've told a lot of them that he spoke at night .
As for its frequency , it can be completely rapodic ( for example , only once it occurs in a disease with high fever ) or more regular ( daily , once a week or once a month ) and usually the next day the child does not remember anything .
The appearance can not be traced back to a single trigger .
Often associated with other sleep disorders , such as nightmares , night alarms , night bed - wetting (enuresis nocturna ) or sleepwalking , but this is not legal either .
As already mentioned , it may be a condition with high fever , or even an accompanying phenomenon of stress or increased excitement .
In any case , they have not studied it so far .
The intensity of speech is also very variable .
It can be quiet , calm , can be made of unrelated words , mumble , but unlike all this , it can also occur in the form of shouting , crying or more long - term speech .
If the phenomenon is very intense , it is recommended to observe the child and to consult a specialist . The examination may reveal whether there is a problem that causes great anxiety and thus can offer a solution .
As already mentioned , there is a benign phenomenon , and therefore there is no cure unless it comes with a different , manageable form of sleep disorder ( for example , insomnia or stress ) .
But there are a few things we can do , and here 's a bunch of preventive measures :
Make sure that the child remains calm before bedtime .
Choose soothing games and avoid watching the child watching scary or aggressive TV shows or series .
To children who are prone to nervousness or more difficult to relax , we teach some relaxation methods to find inner rest .
It helps the child sleep more relaxed .
If you do start talking while you 're sleeping , let 's try to keep our peace .
Remember , this is harmless to the child , and the next day they wo n't remember anything .
Useful advice
Do not wake the child .
It would be unnecessary , because the child is not conscious , but it would reduce the sleep .
Despite his talk , he 's actually sleeping and resting .
Remember , if you are accompanied by strong anxiety several times , it is advisable to consult a specialist or explore what causes a high degree of anxiety from the child .
If you speak English ( this is the rarer case ) do not start asking questions to find out anything from him .
It would be unnecessary , since you 're not so conscious when you 're sleeping to gather your thoughts .
On the other hand , you can only hear the speech , but you can not see the dreams associated with it , so be careful with the interpretation of the dead and possible conclusions .
Never tell the kid that they can question his secrets at night .
Not even for fun .
This is a very serious problem .
So the most important thing is not to worry , because it 's only a few minutes of harmless episode .
Finally straightforward with the Illhaeusern
After a long dive , Illhaeusern 's team finally gained a new boost and won again in the home field .
Although there was no hilarious match , the yellow - blacks were put in a number of situations , one of which they eventually managed to win .
The pace of the match was not too tight , as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm .
The first goal was shot by the captain of the guest team , Kauffmann , but the remote ball was just touching the upper corner of the gate tree . Then Illhaeusern was taken over , and the shots followed each other : Fonderflick tried to shoot a remote shot , and Hirn 's shot landed above the gate . Romain spiccel , Diebold also tried to shake the Dannemarie 's defense with a remote attempt .
On the other hand , players were defending themselves in a block on the midfield , and only the ever - moving Riahi was shot .
The beginning of the second half was crucial : Riahi and Temporale were first placed on Dannemarie 's side . Right after the first goal : Diebold 's first shot , he scored a snap out of the illhaeuserni Marais with excellent position , and then he put it in the goal (53 .min ) .
The Illhausern goal player could not enjoy the glory for long , but was forced to leave the field twelve minutes later , so his teammates had to fight in a man 's disadvantage .
However , Dannemarie could not take advantage of it : they did not cause much trouble for the domestic team , who just took a little bit back to strengthen their defence . The last seconds alone saved some excitement , when after a great rush the ball got very close to the goal .
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before you fly to the United States , Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany .
On Monday , the demonstration held by fishermen paralyzed the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports . Therefore , the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protesters .
The latter promised to receive the President in a " constructive spirit " and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with " specific proposals " .
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the " crisis committee " , which was created by Breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the increase in the price of diesel , as the oil price exceeded the average price of € 1.14 per liter .
According to David Martinon , spokesperson for the President of the Republic , the President will discuss " with fishermen , what solutions could help companies recover their competitiveness , and make the working conditions and wages safer for sailors " .
Fishermen are determined to wait for Nicolas Sarkozy to arrive .
Tuesday morning , in Morbihan and kapunk County , traffic - slowing demonstrations were held , which brought about nearly 10 km long congestion .
They also paralyzed the transport of Quiberon 's yacht port , but the roads to Belle -île were not blocked .
They 've placed roadblocks on the Quiberon Peninsula .
At dawn , tyres and pallets were set on fire in front of the fuel warehouses of the bresti ports , while protests took place in Concerneau and in Saint - Brieuc .
Further movements followed the Atlantic and other ports of La ítél . For example , in Vendée County , fishermen did not board , while in Le Havre , about twenty ships prevented the traffic of commercial vessels .
La Turballe and Le Croisic fishermen in Loire - Atlantique County closed the block of the huge Total oil refinery in Donges .
Boulogne - sur - Mer 's fishermen decided to wait for the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday , by deciding on further steps .
In Le Guilvinec , the " crisis committee " has to decide on the next step and participation of the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on Tuesday .
However , some Breton fishermen do not want their interests represented by the leaders of the national fisheries committee , as the Committee did not support their efforts .
" The strike continues " , because " fishermen refuse to allow their demands " and " refuse to travel to Paris " , said Liliane Cariou , President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee .
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel , currently pay about 50 cents for litres , but believe that the operation of a boat would only become profitable if the price of diesel would fall below 0.30 euros per liter .
The wonderful Paul Newman
The unforgettable character of "utch Cassidy and Sundance Kid " in Connecticut , at 83 , was killed due to cancer .
Hillary and Bill Clinton , Nicolas Sarkozy , George Clooney , Julia Roberts , Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also paid their respects to the actor and actor who died at 83 , Paul Newman .

AIG would sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group , which is based on US financial authorities , wants to sell more than 15 % of its assets to pay back the $ 85 billion in advance , the Dominican edition of the Financial Times .
In addition to his international life insurance and American pension insurance activities , AIG would be rid of almost all other businesses – the newspaper clarified the source of the case .
According to Times ' notices , the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sales .
AIG has not confirmed this information .
The asset stock that AIG intends to sell includes the company ’s International Lease Financial Corp. , the 59 % share of Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company , its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments , the Times adds .
The paper says , however , that there is no final decision on sales .
AIG must quickly acquire liquid assets to repay the US government 's $ 85 billion loan , which will take the risk of losing its shareholders from 80 % of its capital and in the right proportion .
Paris Historique study of Morning Meeting ’s historic Morning Meeting session
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan . The Dow Jones index dropped by 6.98 % ( which means nearly 800 points of decline ) and Nasdaq fell by 9.14 % .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index ( DJIA ) sank by 777.68 points , thus closing at 10 365.45 points .
The largest decline in the index ( 684,81p ) was registered on 17 September 2001 , when the trade rebooted after the terrorist attack on 11 September .
Nasdaq closed at 1 983.73 points with a decrease of 199.61 , mainly based on technological papers , while the extended index of Standard &amp;Poor 's 500 decreased by 8.81 % ( i.e. 106.85 points ) to 1 106.55 points according to official closing data .
The Wall Street stock market was weak even at the opening , and when the Senate unexpectedly refused to recover the banking plan for the restoring of the market balance , it began to fly deep .
Members refused to provide the resources requested by the Minister of Finance Henry Paulson against 205 " yes " by 228 votes .
The plan was voted out by nearly two thirds of Republicans .
" This market has filtered bad signals , as Congress seems unable to approve a plan , " says Lindsey Piegza , FTN Financial analyst .
“ It shows how much the market expected this plan ” , he added , and then expressed his concern that if a few days later , such a plan would be “ too late ” .
" If the plan is really doomed ( ... ) then Fed ( American central bank - ed . ) and other central banks will be in line to deal with the crisis and the credit conditions will be tightened " , Brian Bethune , Global Insight 's leading economist , warns .
To further increase the sense of urgency , Piegza adds : " Every day after that , another financial institution goes bankrupt " in the United States .
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday , authorities made sure that Wachovia 's banking business was bought by its rival Citigroup .
In Europe , the crisis has suddenly accelerated , which has required urgent measures to save banks in the UK , in the Benelux states , Iceland and Germany . This indicates that the market is not only an American but a global crisis , ” adds the FTN Financial analyst .
The bond market has been significantly thrived .
The yield of the 10-year - old government bond fell from 3,827 % to 3,632 % on Friday evening , and 30 years fell from 4,357 % to 4,161 % on the previous day .
Obama won the first television duel
The first debate of the two American presidential candidates was followed by another one , which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner of the duel .
Not surprisingly , the Republican and Democratic campaign holders both claimed victory in the television duel that was haunted by one third of American households .
According to political analyst David Gergen , although John McCain 's performance was respectable , he did not prove to be " impressive " enough to stop his popularity from falling : this is proven by the polls taken five weeks before the presidential election .
According to the Gallup Institute , the Democratic candidate is better at fighting : according to the results published on Saturday , Obama has a five - point preference against McCain ( 44 % and 49 % ) .
39 % of the respondents who are most calculated , even indecent voters , believe Obama will win , while 25 % expect McCain to win according to CBS survey .
Obama is expected to further increase the advantage of his partner Joseph Biden 's great Thursday performance .
Bill Clinton warned me this weekend : " It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin .
He has good instincts . "
In his 70s , McCain never misses putting his own , undoubtedly vast foreign policy experience first . However , he emphasizes his opponent ’s “ naivety ” in these issues , which were at the heart of their first personal meeting .
" Senator Obama does n't seem to understand that ... " - has been said several times .
" I do n't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge required for the presidency , " said McCain .
This is the main attack platform that has been used by Republican TV ads running since yesterday .
Obama , however , put the emphasis on representing the future .
He did not let himself be embarrassed : he was collected and precisely put .
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world .
" McCain still does n't understand , Obama is now " - the democrat ad broadcast this weekend , which puts the Republican leader 's eye on the fact that he still has n't assessed the impact of the crisis on the American " street people " .
" In 90 minutes of the debate , John McCain had a lot to say about me , but nothing about you , " said Obama in front of 20,000 people who gathered in rain in North Carolina for the election meeting .
The confusion in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama , who the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy on the verge of collapse .
" Next week could prove a turning point " , said Charles Schumer , the influential Democratic senator yesterday .
Democratic MP Rahm Emanuel , a veteran of the Clinton government , said Obama " has such excellent instincts in the field of economy " as Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis .
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate , the current crisis is the " final judgment over the eight - year - long bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain " .
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the stock market fluctuations , it will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95 % of Americans . He added that the primary goals of the country include the creation of a possible energy independence by applying renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system .
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030 .
However , both presidential candidates carefully avoided issues that concern the banking rescue plan of $ 700 billion ( € 470 billion ) : the extremely popular plan was adopted last night by Congress .
Minsk : " You have noticed that there was a choice here ? "
Young and opposition officials protested Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected result of parliamentary elections .
On Sunday evening , hundreds of Belarusians gathered on the main square of Minsk after the closing of the voting rooms to protest against counterfeiting the election results .
Although results have not yet been published , many young protestors against President Alexandr Lukasenko have said , " Mr.iktator , resign ! " .
Some people admit that they did n’t even go to vote : “ What did I go to ? They ’ll do with my vote what they want ! ” says a young man .
The protesters do not believe that the regime , which tried to make itself a good face for foreign observers to connect with the European Union , would be ready for a democratic change of regime .
If the elections were considered clear by the observers , they could dissolve sanctions against the country , which were denied to 40 Belarusian leaders the visa and some bank accounts were frozen .
The opposition said that the elections were not clear .
" They kept us away from the election committees , and our observers could not participate in the counting of votes " - sorry Yuri Potyemkin , organized from the twelve parties , so he was a spokesperson for a very heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition .
" The changes were merely nominal " , emphasizes Alexander Milinkievics , opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro - European movement .
If the opposition delegates get into Parliament , it means they 're appointed , not elected .
But their access to Parliament allows them to be placed on television , to sit in the country ’s regions and to submit billing .
The opposition must therefore step up in political life , because " dialogue must be initiated with the European Union " .
Because if our highly indebted economy against Russia is in crisis and we are unable to renew , we risk being under Russia ’s control .
We want to be independent . "
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation , which is accompanying the election process , will accept the results of the vote .
They emphasize that the participation rate seems too high and that the broad organisation of the preliminary vote ( 26 % of voters in Minsk ) gave the opportunity to manipulate any kind of manipulation .
" You have noticed that there was a choice here?"- asks the question of the Social Democratic leader of Alexander Kozulin , who was released from prison in August as the last one to be released from prison , where he was held as a political prisoner .
No one was in the polling stations .
The Parliament will have up to five opposition representatives , the ones who are most appropriate to the leadership .
The silence of the night is falling again to October Square .
On television , President Lukasenko and members of the Central Electoral Committee will be successful .
Blood is safe again
President Francine Décary had a good reason to celebrate because Héma - Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood donors in the world .
And most importantly , he managed to regain the trust of people , which was severely shaken by the blood - related disadvantage of the 1980s and 1990s .
As is known , the national blood reserve treated by the Canadian Red Cross blood supply service was infected with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV ) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s .
Following the drama and general depression , the government of Canada launched an official investigation under Judge Horace Krever in February 1994 , which was designed to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to propose proposals to avoid similar cases in the future .
While Judge Krever submitted a delayed report , some provinces set up their own committees to design a new blood treatment system for Canada .
In Québec , the Gélineau Committee was responsible for this task .
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports , two blood supply services were created in Canada : one is the Quebec Service Héma - Québec , and the other is the Canadian Blood Supply Company responsible for all other provinces and two territories .
" When the Héma - Québec began its activity in 1998 , only 38 % of people had confidence in Quebec 's blood supply system " , Dr. Décary remembers .
The situation was desperate .
" In the following years , however , we managed to regain the trust of people as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field . " Décary proudly stated that almost 94 % of the Québec population had considered the Héma - Québec reliable in early 2008 .
But Dr. Décary does not forget that " trust is a very fragile thing " .
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998 , the Héma - Québec has applied the principle of caution .
During this period , many cases in Europe were discovered when the new variations of the Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease have infected people , the doctor says , who has been controlling the company since its foundation in 1998 .
" We had no idea if this disease was spreading through blood .
Therefore , we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports . In this case , if we are uncertain and there is a risk of developing a serious disease , we must apply precluding measures . In this case , Creutzfeldt - Jakob was a disease that causes brain lesions , thus inevitably leads to death .
Therefore , in April 1999 , we did not take blood from people who spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 .
And a few years ago , it was undoubtedly determined that the disease spreads through blood .
This case convinced us that we had a reason to apply the principle of caution . "
In 1999 , a technique appeared on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus . This nucleic acid test ( NNAT ) , which can directly detect the virus in the blood of blood transmitters , rather than antibodies that are created against the virus , for which the tests used earlier were built .
With the help of the NAT test , we could shorten the window period , which lasts from infection until we can show the virus in the blood using our technical tools , explains the specialist .
This period was reduced to less than a week .
This has led to a significant reduction in the risk of blood donors infecting the blood vessel beyond their knowledge , and that this can not be detected .
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of AIDS spread through blood transfusion .
Nowadays , the risk of getting infected with HIV is 12 million to one .
" In other words , this means we should allocate 12 million blood products until someone gets infected with HIV .
Since theéma - Québec distributes 400 - 500 thousand blood products every year , more than 24 years should pass to a case like this and someone is infected with HIV virus through a blood treatment .
I think that anyone can accept or prescribe blood transfusions to restore health nowadays , says the chief leader of the Héma - Québec .
" The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products .
We never know what kind of new pathogen is going to enter the system .
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion , which , like the West Nile virus , enters the blood with insect bites .
Therefore , we must constantly be alert , ” said Dr. Décary , and stressed that aside from the emergency reserves , the Héma - Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves .
" The needs of the population are increasing by ageing .
Since anticancer treatments have become more aggressive , patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets .
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donors , as the number of people in the network that are capable of blood is only 3 % of the population of Quebec .
However , all healthy persons , at least 18 years old , can give blood to the person who fulfills the conditions of suitability every 56 days , that is , six times a year .
On average , 14 % of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria , and those who have been in a country where malaria is destroyed are not entitled to blood for a year .
" With this 3 percent , we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals .
It 's very rare that we run out of supplies .
However , we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the existing ones age , because they can no longer give blood after a while .
But it 's very hard to convince people to give blood , but it 's even harder to keep them and make them become regular blood taxes .
In this world of rush today , one has barely got an hour to go to give blood " , pityed by Francine Décary .
The Héma - Québec , an annual budget of $ 297 million , not only provides blood products , but also human tissues , such as bone transplants , heart valves , eyeball tissues and skin tissue , which is used almost exclusively for severely burned individuals .
These tissues are analyzed , converted and frozen , then placed at theéma - Québec , which also manages the only public stem cell bank in Quebec .
Only blood from the umbilical cord , which was treated as medical waste , can be extracted from blood that is rich in stem cells , thus also allows the treatment of serious diseases ( such as leukemia ) .
" A few weeks ago , we celebrated the thousands of umbilical blood samples in our bank , and we plan to take over a thousand new samples every year .
At the beginning of next year we will probably start offering these for organ transplants , ” said Dr. Décary , who says the umbilical blood - extraction program is very popular today .
" Many mothers are sad because they do n't have the opportunity " - indeed , it is , because theéma - Québec has no way of making this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec .
Football - semi - finals of Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders at USL-1 3:1 yesterday and got to the semi - finals with a total 4:3 result . This was the second and crucial match for the results of the final match , which took place at Saputo Stadium .
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in 90 minutes .
While the first half - time went without goal , in the second round , the Montreal team found two goals , David Testo and Rocco Plancentino in the opponent 's net .
Roger Levesque from Sounders ' team was the only one who managed to play Matt Jordan .
Recall that in the first match of Friday , Impact 2:1 was defeated by Starfire Complex in Tukwila , outside Seattle .
The Impact is in the semi - finals with Vancouver Whitecaps .
In Minnesota , the Thunder team lost 3:1 in the first match , won 4:3 , but Whitecaps made the final with a 5:4 overall result .
The Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday , but the details of the matches are still being clarified today .
In a nutshell - Kovalev 's winning goal
The favourite Triassic of the hatalmas is ready for another season .
Alex Kovalev , Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led a three - way attack , and finally the S.A.V. won 3:2 out of penalty shots last night at Centre Bell .
Kostitsyn , the first star of the meeting , scored a goal . Plekanec finished the match with two goals , which was the fourth win of six team games .
The match was decided by Kovalev , who scored the only goal of the blast .
" I 'm not ready yet " - a warning from the Russian player .
" I need another game to feel really good about myself . "
" He tried to get too much out of himself in the first trimester , " Guy Carbonneau noted .
" But I think he was happy about the outcome of the match .
He 's had a huge ovation . "
Charest 's North aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year
Jean Charest was already in the québec Jean - Talon yesterday , where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc ( left ) is about to win in the interim election to be held today .
" To push back our last great northern border " : this ambitious long - term goal was set by Jean Chares at the Liberal Party meeting in Levis , Quebec .
During his performance , behind his back , they were screening images similar to " Moulin à images " .
The three huge projectors were followed by impressive footage : water power plants , mining , Quebec on " Google Maps " , maps ...
Such spectacular instruments are used in election periods .
The Prime Minister refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn , although he added that his schedule was very tight .
The "északi plan " is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister 's vision of Quebec 's future , which is embodied in a " new economic area " . It includes a workforce agreement with France , an agreement between Canada and Europe and a convention with several other countries .
Recently , opening to the North ( i.e. the northern area beginning at 49 degrees ) has often been in the Prime Minister ’s speeches , but he has never given a lecture on this topic .
However , the head of state merely insisted on explaining why he was " a treasure mine full of huge opportunities " .
It has only highlighted a few development opportunities : mainly water power plants , forestry and , in particular , mining , which is further stimulated by the growth of the catching countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures .
It is located in the north with "nikkel , zinc , copper , platinum , gold , silver , iron , titanium and even diamonds " , he described Charles .
This area , which is " twice the size of France " , is our territory , Quebec .
Not only in our place , but in ourselves , ” the head of state said , emphasizing that it would create a national founding myth .
He highlighted that Quebec 's development was largely determined by the relationship with the North : the gold rush in Abitibi , the Québec design work , the James Bay .
" This is ours , our future ! " he added , after taking a stage break , he looked at the huge map behind his back .
The North , which is 70 % of Quebec , includes a part of Labrador , which Quebec has always claimed for itself , the Prime Minister said at the press conference .
" This is our historical statement , which is confirmed by all governments .
There is a line of border that has been not agreed for a long time , and if there is an opportunity , I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government , ” he said .
On the other hand , “ in the light of climate change we need to rethink our North - related viewpoint ” , the Prime Minister said , speaking about the northwest gateway that opens every year as a result of the melting of polar ice .
In the opinion of the Prime Minister , in this new geopolitical environment , the capture of the territory is an important task .
And what about the indigenous people of the area , the Indians and Eskimos ?
The Prime Minister said that Quebec ’s government will pay special attention to them and will benefit from the plan , especially young people .
The two ministers of the different parties , Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau ( recently a member of the Parti Quebeccois ungavai ) , have already started the negotiations with about thirty local communities .
The Inter - ministerial Committee led by Benoît Pelletier also started its operation , in which Julie Boulet ( Minister for Transport and Natural Resources ) plays an important role .
The Prime Minister does not exclude the possibility of a large - scale meeting , " not necessarily a summit " , where they create a " common vision " .
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development .
The Northern Plan will be coordinated , systematically and environmentally friendly , " the Prime Minister promised .
Jean Charest described this " vision " as consistent with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers before him .
" Just like the former liberals , we think differently : our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges . "
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend , which began on Friday with a big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of the election of Jean Lesage .
One of the decisions adopted suggests that Beauharnois power plant be renamed Adélard - Godbout Dam .
" Our political partners , including Hydro - Québecet founder Godbout , Lesage , who implemented the quiet revolution and the national distribution of hydroelectric power plants , or Bourassa , known as the father of James Bay , knew how to forge the future , " said Jean Charest .
He also quoted another work , true , conservative , which was the programme of John Diefenbaker , Prime Minister of the United States between 1957 and 1963 .
In connection with the plan of the Eastmain1a - Ruper hydroelectric dam , President Charest highlighted that the planting was planned for 2012 .
" This is between us , but I plan to be there " , he told his believers , and his statement was received by a loud applause storm .
In April , the Prime Minister , who said that there would be no election in 2008 and probably in 2009 , did not exclude the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn , which is also allowed by law .
He stressed , however , that his calendar is already full , as he has undertaken tasks at the Chinese meeting of the federal council and at the Quebec - New York summit .
The party assembly held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to express nationalist decisions , which were almost approved without thinking .
They also want Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian radio and telecommunications council , and these members would have veto rights regarding decisions taken in Quebec .
The opposition , however , has received the main points of the Northern Plan skeptically .
Parti Quebec , Head of the Parti Quebec , Paulina Marois , re - proposed the North - Quebec development policy , which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001 .
Marois said that the liberal government came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy .
If they had not , " we would have gone far ahead " , she said , in agreement with Mrs. Marois Françoise Mercure , who was the candidate for today 's Jean - Talon vote .
The ADQ opposition party supports the government 's acceptance of the Northern Plan .
" We , however , would like this to be not a mere act , " said party leader Sébastien Proulx , who replaced Mario Dumont , returning from his freedom today .
Letters - A disgraced country
Vic Toews , Minister of the Harper Cabinet ( by the way , Minister of Justice ) , took the liberty of calling Louise Arbourt Canada " ashamed " last summer .
To defame a woman who has fought for justice and deserves all our admiration , this tells us a lot about the people surrounding the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself .
This is our government , who , of the Western countries concerned , did not deliver home his own national from the Guantánamo concentration camp .
This is the government that absolutely does not consider the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes he had committed .
This is the only government that , despite Canada signing the Geneva Convention , refused to give word and let a child soldier suffer under inhumane circumstances .
The only government who turns the Justice Department into a puppet theater while investigating the guiltyness of a defendant .
Let us remember that UNICEF , Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers are also demanding the return of Omar Khadr to a fair trial in Canada .
And our government turns a blind eye to the torture : it does n’t matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed spiritually , and many years of torture probably sealed his fate for life .
Although we are not aware of this now , but at present our rights , the insidious destruction of our freedom and democracy is taking place . " Democracy " : Harper constantly makes this word sound like a mere empty voice from his mouth .
So the time has come when there is no more morality : they can arbitrarily beat , torture and imprisonment any Canadian citizen , in the light of the convenience of a government leader who has been in a minority until now ( and what can come after October 14th ... ) .
Many electors believe that salvation can be found at a party that glorifies the virtue , the law and the Order . They do not see that this government is tapping the values that our country has given its good name and dignity .
Dear Mr Toews , the shame is more like this - do n't look elsewhere .
Opinion - The speech of Barrick Gold orwelli
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir , a letter was published from Patrick J. Garver , Deputy President and CEO of the Canadian Barrick Gold mine .
In his presentation in Orwell , Garver declares that the world 's largest gold - producing company has launched a six - million dollar libel lawsuit against three authors and a small - money publishing company in order to initiate a so - called " public debate " .
Although judges are independent and impartial , their decision , especially in slander lawsuits , is not made on the basis of justice , but by law .
It 's no surprise Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference .
Would the best way to open a public debate for Barrick Gold is to destroy anyone who has a conflicting opinion with his ?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial , authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts on defence and struggle in an uneven battle where the other side is supported by an army of lawyers with almost inexhaustible sources of mining industry .
In such an unequal struggle , however , they often use the tactic to destroy the defendant and conclude a friendly agreement , which not only silences the contrary , but also intimidates those who would try to deal with the issue again .
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate , he should have expressed his views in public .
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates , this happens differently , in Canada , the parties who argue do not usually punch each other with a stick , but they tell their thoughts .
The mine would therefore have been enough to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in a press , media , publications , paying for independent research groups that could have shed light on the issue .
But it seems Barrick Gold does n't trust the public , and it 's gon na take a step to mislead the requests and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada .
Mr. Garver might explain how to initiate a " public " debate if he does not take the public 's view ?
In the head of the Deputy President , this word probably means only lawyers paid for in a way , not Canada ’s total population : the meaning of the concept is thus narrowed .
In a democratic state , even the other scoundrels are entitled to freedom of speech .
But Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mostly supported by the public because they condemn the rough method of the mine .
The public is prepared to listen to Barrick and make a judgment , but it would be done on the basis of civilized arguments , not by a lawsuit for a lot of people to be silenced . ( In the case of the term " public debate " , Barrick Gold recently called on the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term . )
In addition to Garver 's surreal expositions , Barrick Gold 's process is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth , which are the building blocks of all democratic societies .
In the whole procedure , it denies the right to quote authentic sources , something about the dispute on facts and their interpretation , which forms the basis of intellectual activities .
If in a country like Canada you can study and discuss topics that are not pleasing to the rich companies of today ’s world , who will take the liberty of doing so ?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate , it could do so by the scientific standards that Noir Canada authors use .
You have the right to answer .
In our university circle we have been able to deal with disputes , differences of views and conflicts for a long time .
The reckless procedure of Barrick Gold shows that , unlike his claim , he does not want to engage in an open debate .
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debate in Canada . It is time for governments to implement measures that limit legal proceedings for such abuse .
Wall Street Rescue Mission - The Democrats and Republicans agreed
The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Bush government and Congress finally reached an agreement yesterday on the economic rescue operation , which has been the biggest tailor - made plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The $ 700 billion plan , which aims to stop the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months , must still be approved by the two houses of Congress .
The main points of the plan : more effective control of implementation by representatives ; new mechanisms to repay the state funds ; new provisions to keep the number of houses booked due to the lack of payments ; access to the payment of the leaders of the companies received from the aid .
Henry Paulson , US Secretary of Finance , Nancy Pelosi , President of the US House of Representatives and Judd Gregg , the Republican representative in the trial , announced the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two - day marathon hearing ended .
“ We have made a great step towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets , ” said Henry Paulson , Bush Government representative .
" We did everything to save the real economy and the American citizens from the current crisis that hit Wall Street , " the Democratic representative explained .
" The most important aspect is that if we do n't do this , then the shock , chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of Americans will be huge , " said Republican representative Judd Gregg .
The trial was accelerated within the last few hours , fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on the mood of investors .
They gave themselves a deadline for the settlement until the opening of the stock market this morning .
Two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations were willing to agree , but they expressed themselves , and they were not happy that the situation had increased to the end .
Democratic Senator Barack Obama himself attributed to the extension of the agreement with elements such as the preservation of home property or the payment of the leaders of the companies helped by the state .
" When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps due to the irresponsibility of other people , it is not very welcome .
These steps are necessary , " he noted on an American television show .
And when his opponent , John McCain , another channel , asked if he would vote for the proposed plan , he said , " I 'd like to know the details , but I hope so . "
" What I have read in large lines , it is already visible that it is a matter that we all need to digest , and by which we can move forward .
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable , ” he said .
According to the 700 billionaire plan , taxpayers would buy dubious demands from American financial institutions , some unsustainable assets at risk .
The plan was preceded by a crisis of 14 months , which was triggered by the release of the real estatelufi . This first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans ( secondary mortgages ) , and then spread to other debt securities , and ultimately caused the freezing of liquid resources and the stirring up of banks and financial institutions .
The first draft agreement was failed by a group of Republican representatives last week .
It seems that we 've managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed to provide some " poisonous " tools for companies in difficult situations rather than the government .
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied , a provision has been included in the plan , which requires that if the government has to bear losses within the framework of the programme for five years , it may issue new taxes to recover its resources .
As part of the new plan , a $ 250 billion payment would be made ; this could be followed by another $ 100 billion if the president considered it necessary .
The remaining $ 350 billion payout should be approved by Congress by a new vote .
In exchange for the help , Washington will earn a share in the supported companies , which will give him dividends of profits and which he can sell after the crisis is reduced .
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure of properties that cover the mortgages covered by the plan .
The developers of the plan would like the plan to be voted by the House of Representatives today , and on Wednesday the Senate .
However , despite their efforts , it is still not certain that the plan is approved .
Yesterday , the statements against the plan were repeated among Republicans and Democrats .
" It is clear that Washington will not hear your voice , " said Republican Scott Garrett , who is a member of the House 's financial committee .
" Yes , we have serious financial problems .
Yes , there are solutions .
But there is no one that would benefit the taxpayers . "
Brad Sherman , the Democratic representative who leads the small congress group , called the "szkeptic faction " , presents things differently , but comes to the same conclusion .
" Four hundred excellent economic experts , including three Nobel Prize winners , wrote to us to ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine which path he chooses , " said Sherman yesterday .
In Europe , it was once again understood that this is a global crisis .
After a crisis meeting , the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize a portion of the Fortis banking group in value of € 11.2 billion ( € 16.3 billion ) .
The intervention of the governments of Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy up its competitor on the verge of bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million ( US$ 2.9 billion ) due to the crisis of secondary mortgages in the United States .
With 85,000 employees of Fortis , it is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the top ten insurance companies .
" This is not a dump money " , said Wouter Bos , Dutch Finance Minister .
" In exchange for voting rights and influence in the bank .
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is uncertain . "
Meanwhile , on the other side of the English government , the British government seems to be preparing to nationalize another bank , which was lost in the financial crisis .
According to the British press , the government would assume the total amount of ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley , of which the real estate loans amount to £ 41 billion ( $ 75.5 billion ) .
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they would buy out the subsidiaries and customer stocks of the British bank .
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the British government has wanted to nationalize since the beginning of the crisis .
Paul Newman ( 1925 - 2008 ) - Farewell to the cast idol
Some say that his beautiful azure eyes were his main trump card , others said he was his main weakness .
Have you ever gotten rid of a mirror in Narcissus the charming American actor ?
Yes and no .
His shyness , sensitivity and innate talent also made him a distant style of the real monstrosities of the art world .
But what a huge track !
Paul Newman died of lung cancer on Friday at 83 , in Connecticut , California , and was one of the last icons of the American cinema 's flower age .
He was less monumental than Brando , who was a rival for a long time on the screen . He was more restrained and undoubtedly vulnerable , but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions .
The blending of blood often comes from extraordinary children .
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio , to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother .
European roots contributed to the birth of a symbolic figure of the American dream .
He did n't think much about himself , which only increased his merit .
In the early 1950s , Yale University studied drama at the Nintendo 's Studio , and then in New York , before the theater , television and soon after the world of cinema broke down .
In addition to being a civilian rights fighter , he was second place in the Le Mans 24-hour race as a racing driver in 1979 .
Now we can never know what shadows were in the life of this mysterious , private , dedicated actor who hated the shining of show business .
He was a man of truth , in the most noble sense of the word .
Paul Newman 's death at the end of the week shocked the movie fans : in his big roles , we can only see him on the black screen of the memories .
The seventh American art has been going through us , and the cinema has been changing with constant changes for over fifty years .
In our memory , we have a marvelous cowboy of "utch Cassidy and Sundance Kid " ( 1969 ) and a young man who is estranged from his sensual wife ( Elizabeth Taylor ) , whose role we saw in Tennessee Williams processing " Cat on the Hot Tin roof " in 1958 .
From the past ( 1990 ) , we can remember him in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge , who faces his age by not having his marriage fulfilled his hopes .
Paul Newman was also seen in his films with many other faces .
Robert Wise in his film " Someone Upstairs " , a stormy - lived criminal boxer , played an unforgettable performance as Rocky Graziano , which was originally meant for James Dean and after his death , started Newman 's acting career in 1956 .
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work " The Big Trouble " , which won the Oscar for Best Film in 1973 .
Robert Rossen in his genius film " The svindler " ( 1961 ) played a bitter , vindictive billiard player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese 's film " The Color of Money " .
Change times , but it 's always the same face : it was him .
He always has been .
The period of his career was marked by the change in ages .
The younger ones are mainly known from George Roy Hill 's cult film " Ice Breakers " ( 1977 ) , where Reggie Dunlop is played by a hockey team 's non - standard coach .
His fans saw him in the " The Big Jump " , listed by Coen brothers in 1994 .
The line was ended in 2003 by Sam Mendes 's " The Way of Damnation " , the last time he appeared in the role of an Irish mob boss .
Unlike many movie legends who left the film director relatively soon , Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time , although he condemned Hollywood with its glitter , glow and hypocrisy .
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not consider it " living denial of under - play " without any humor : he thought his game was too powerful .
However , the profession was not always gracious to handsome Paul Newman , whose role was simply falling into his lap for a long time .
Yet he played less often young and successful characters : he was more likely to form figures living on the edge of society - a nervous , alcoholic , malignant or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion were returned with perfect credibility .
As a director , Newman showed a less well - known face : in his soul , he was truly coy and sensitive .
In 1968 , in the film " Rachel Rachel " , which was adapted to the novel by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence , Joanne Woodward drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman .
The 1984 film " Harry and his son " , which was made in 1984 , commemorates Scott 's son , who died of drug overdose .
Yesterday Newman remembered the actor by countless admirers . His close friend and his old partner Robert Redford ( with whom he " The Big Trouble " and " Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid " ) , and said : " His presence made my life and the world better .
Greatness and joy of being : it was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor , who we have now lost .
In addition to his legendary career , he is clouded by his comments on civil rights , the environment , his struggle for independent film production and Hollywood 's evasion .
We often saw his image smiling on the packaging of sauces , sauces , biscuits and other foods .
However , the income from such sales has always been transferred to the foundation of children with a disease .
Newman never sat on his laurels : he remained committed to the profession .
In his letter to five daughters , he wrote the following sentences : " Your father was always and always unimaginably grateful for his lucky star .
It was a privilege for me to be here . "
It is also a privilege for us to follow the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist .
He was a model citizen , above all .
What did they produce in Zuschlag & Tsai 's account factory ?
Soon , on 8 October , the trial against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin .
The politician and his associates are charged with fraud and other crimes , including document forgery , which are particularly significant in the criminal organisation .
According to the prosecutor 's office , the winning tender money was used for their own purposes , and the performance of the tasks was often verified by unreal accounts .
The state and municipal funds , in total , about HUF 65 million , were transferred to the Young Left , partly in the pocket of some people .
The method described by the investigative authority was that the winning tender money was taken on the basis of cost accounts , which were not implemented in the past , and the associations never fulfilled the obligation they had undertaken .
The indictment says most of the accounts were fake .
These are the ones that have taken the invoices in the Józsefváros market , and the circular stamps were produced in Kiskunhalas .
And which companies should be named for the production of accounts , among others , he decided on the Balaton - felvidék kör kör road to which János Zuschlag sent him to the city of Lados .
According to the latter 's testimony , he had to look at bed and breakfasts and restaurants .
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there , and then he prepared the accounts to be submitted to the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport , the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour , and the Municipality of Budapest .
Most of these were written by István Lados , with his partner András Őri , who , according to our information , wrote mostly the reports necessary to obtain the grants .
One of the most important ones in Lados ' study trip was a beer house .
According to two accounts issued by the Zuschlags , the restaurant provided the meal of the 90-person group of the Safe Point Association .
However , so many of them , according to the CEO , could not have been allowed to join the restaurant at the same time .
In the same way , the bill issued to the Foundation for the Better Future - later , together for the Third Millennium - was full of formal and content errors in the summer of 2002 .
A Bunkacsonytomaji boarding house was only three rooms , more than ten people could not humiliate one evening , but the bill was about a hundred and thirty guests .
But the imaginary forms were over - fated even when they marked Pigal Kft . , whose books , according to the information given to the prosecution , were not included in the documents for the Right Future and Hoppa .
The company 's manager , Győző Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was called to the DA 's office and they showed him accounts , he immediately knew it was a fake document .
" Our company name and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp . "
He added : beyond the formal reasons , it was not right that 100 people were accommodated , because they have eleven rooms in total , in which there is not so many places .
Plus , the bill was for meals , while their restaurant was long gone .
The zealous account makers did not follow up on the fact that the travel agency they looked for only organizes foreign roads , so they have marked a trip to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account , which also did not match the company ’s account emission practices .
In addition , as it turned out in the investigation , VAT was included in the document , although travel activities to countries outside the European Union were VAT - free .
Among other things , the VAT rate was also a mistake on the four documents issued by Hotel szálloda szálloda szálloda szálloda szálloda szálloda szálloda szállodafülöp Kft . for the Right Future , because the service of the company is not charged by the designated 25.15 percent VAT , and the hotel employees only issued a machine invoice , but the invoice was manual .
In addition , the “ exhibitors ” also spoiled the account by indicating road freight for a company as a task carried out - it was revealed that the company was not based on the original investment consultancy .
In addition , there were formal differences - inappropriate invoice format , not real stamp - because the joint joint accounts for the Third Millennium Foundation , the 21st century Cultural Association and the Secure Point are false .
Just like Ravenna Bt . or kunartóértói Sporttábor , representatives of which denied that the accounts would have been issued .
Forgerers were not paying attention to , for example , that HIB Kft . in the Nybházi was under liquidation at the time ( 2001 ) when the Young City Association was eating there , and therefore the company ’s liquidator - officer – we know that he denied that he had issued the paper .
I was consciously issued
The other group of invoices is made up of those who were aware that they had to issue a fictional account .
The Foundation for the Chance Budapest has issued an account for the Third Year Foundation , at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists , for about four million forints .
The leader of Collab Ltd. , according to the indictment , was made by one of the defendants , Györfi Ludovic , to issue the fictional invoice .
Biogate Ltd. , currently under liquidation , also cooperated with the Zuschlags , which in 2003 provided the Better Future Foundation , the Atlas Association and the Red Pine Association with roughly five million forints of invoices , which were not behind which there was a real economic activity .
Money movement is not possible , because the accounts were then made available , but the organizations forgot to include it in their documents .
The next group of companies issuing the invoice are those that are linked to the accused .
Thus , the service agent of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft . , based in Budapest , was Iván Kubatov .
The company issued several accounts in October 2005 , in November and December , on the sale of computer equipment , worth around HUF 18 million .
According to the investigation , these accounts were purchased by kiskunhalasi Cash Investment Ltd. , which was charged since 14 September 2005 .
This company was managed by a Romanian man , to whom Iván Kubatov would also forward the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005 .
We understand Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued an invoice to the Atlas , Hoppa and the Third Millennium Foundation on behalf of the Kft .
The Romanian stone craftsmen Fa - Bani Jos Faipari Kft . and Jos - Investment Bt . were founded at the request of Iván Kubatov .
However , none of the companies actually worked , which the defendant said was the reason they did not get a job .
At the request of Zsolt Szente , who also made the paperwork of the company , he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to associations associated with Zuschlag : the Atlas and the Y - Generation .
On behalf of Cash Investment , Delta Trio , Fa - Ban Jos , Jos Investment and Linaxtrade , Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 accounts , worth HUF 14.2 million .
The prosecution considered 10 % of the amounts indicated in the accounts and the VAT had hit Kubatov .
The man even used Si - Beri Bt to issue fictional accounts , which were produced for the commissioner 's Pont application .
The Y - Generation and the Association submitted a tender for Modern Hungary in January 2006 to the social media organization Mihály Táncsics Foundation ( TMA ) .
They won 500 - 500 thousand forints , but the amounts were not translated for the purposes indicated in the application .
To make sure that does n't come out , five fictional accounts received from Works Team Ltd. were submitted to TMA .
These accounts were found in the search for the house at Árpád Kemecsei ’s office at the educational wallet .
At the trial , some of the defendants , as the prosecutor , probably reported on the process of billing .
It can be interesting , if you are the first defendant , John Zuschlag decides to appeal to the veil of everything .
His testimony so far is not very detailed , and although he has repeatedly promised to speak in all respects , he has not yet done so .
The question is whether it is in the interest of this , or for the benefit of the majority of the damage , 50 million forints , were paid to make a deal with the socialists , and Zushi takes the fall .
Who could be offended by the fact that his applications for house arrest have been constantly found in deaf ears to alleviate the circumstances of his detention .
While the perpetrators of much more harmful and non - reparable economic offences can walk freely , or at least wait for the end of the procedure against them in their own homes , he has no opportunity .
Psychology of overbilling : why are we issuing more money ?
In auctions , buyers tend to spend more money , overvalue the goods .
The neuroscientific and ecological foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior have been revealed by neurologists and economists at the University of New York .
According to their study published in Science , people do not want to miss a competition of the type , such as eBay auction , so they pay too high a price .
He was trying to map this neural scheme of research using experimental auctions .
One group of volunteers was lottery , the other group participated in a player auction , while the functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) method was used to study the active brain areas of experimental persons .
In both games , participants could win money , but during the auction game - in which an important element is the overbidation of the other party - the complex under the striatum , which is under the cortex , was intensely activated when the game was lost .
This area of the brain plays a role in the " self - rewarding " mechanism of the nervous system with several other functions .
Therefore , researchers believe that the price is increased by avoiding the intense reaction of striatum .
To support their theory , the members of the research team also conducted a financial follow - up investigation .
In this three groups bid against a partner in various circumstances .
The control group was simply informed of the realistic value of the product concerned and they made their bets .
In addition , another group was promised that if they were won out of the game , they would receive another $ 15 worth of money .
The third group , however , received just 15 dollars before the auction , but the group members lost this money in case of a losing auction .
The difference between the two groups was , therefore , that the win was emphasized for one and for the other , the loss .
However , proving the hypothesis of neurologists , members of the team playing against " loss " were willing to bet higher than the control and the " winning " group .
" These results can not be traced from any earlier economic theory .
They have only explained the phenomena at auction with the joy of winning and risk avoidance .
Only neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now getting to a third explanation , ” said Andrew Schotter , professor of economics at the University of New York .
Hepatitis : When to consult a doctor ?
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection , and in Hungary , chronic liver disease is mentioned among leading causes of death .
The number of hepatitis infections in Hungary can be 100,000 , but only seven thousand are treated , because of which : patients often do not know that they are infected .
The term hepatitis is a collection name of infections caused by various viruses .
Their symptoms have many similarities , characteristic of hepatitis and jaundice , but their pathogens and diseases caused differ .
Hepatitis viruses range in two main forms depending on the pathogen : hepatitis A and E through the feed channel ( for example , infected with food , water ) , hepatitis B,C,D and other viruses with blood and body fluids ( probe , vaginal secretion , saliva ) .
Travelers should be able to protect themselves against the A and B virus with vaccine , no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis appear two to three weeks after the consumption of the infected food , generally feeling ill , weakness , abdominal complaint , accompanied by nausea .
After this , the jaundice on the skin and the eyeswhite is formed , the stool becomes light , the urine becomes dark , the healing can take two to three weeks .
A million people die worldwide in a more severe type of disease , liver cancer and liver shrink caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected person gets medication .
Hepatitis C may have very serious consequences : if not treated , it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver , liver cancer .
Most infected do not even know about his illness , because the pathogen destroys the liver cells intimately , in many cases , only 20 - 30 years later the first symptoms occur .
Thus , it is very important to perform early prevention , regular screening tests .
In three groups , there is much more than average disease : between people who have been through blood transfusions before 1991 , drug users and tattoos .
The number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C virus is currently 200 million in the world .
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory examination , it is worthwhile to consult a GP when detecting any symptoms of unknown origin .
Recognizing the disease in time , the virus can be exterminated from the body , thus the infestation can be eliminated and the development of cancer can be prevented .
30 September is the World Day for Hepatitis , which was held in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world .
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses , the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease .
Whoever believes in God is less painful ?
According to a recent study , religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller , which could make the death of Catholic martyrs easier .
The scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment , studying the way the belief in God affects the perception of pain , and the British Telegraph reported .
In the framework of a rather bizarre study , 12 Catholic believers and the same many atheists were given electroshock , while all studied a painting of the Virgin Mary .
According to the results , Catholic believers were able to exclude most of the pain .
Thanks to the technology that scanned the human brain , it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for the control of pain .
The study is the first in a series of research in which scientists , philosophers and theologians are involved in different parts of the university .
The study was conducted precisely by strengthening a sparkling device to the left hand of the experimental subject , which provided the electroshock .
Researchers asked participants to look closely at two paintings , the image of the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century painted Lady Hermelin .
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a religious state among the believers , while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and thought it was soothing .
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner , during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive episodes , while either watching religious or general images .
Catholicians reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary they felt " safe " , as they " cared for " and " calmed , peace filled them . "
While watching the religious image , 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo 's creation was seen .
Miguel Farias , a psychologist who himself participated in the study , believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image , even atheists , only the right photo must be found .
" We should find a picture of someone who feels very positive about them , like a mother or a father . "
Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research .
" The practice of faith should be changed and in many cases changes our personality . " Wright added .
After the great results , the question is , if Leonardo or a similar - caliber painter show the believers a picture of a Madonna , what would it do to control their pain ?
Would the sight of the quality Virgin Mary mean even better results ?
You are what you share
On your tenth birthday , Google : people have at least as much in their pockets as they have in the sky ; you know where they have vacationed , what special orders they go and what interests them .
And that 's still not enough Eric Schmidt , according to one of the main people in the company .
As for skeptics that have parallel sceptics in Orwell , they do not see the essence of web 2.0 .
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google ’s main goal is to gather more personal information about their users , and this is necessary to keep themselves in line with the original Google Founders ’ goal , which sounded like “ We ’ll collect all the information in the world ! ” .
According to the Google - led speaker , the company is still at the beginning of ten years of world - changing work to manage all the information .
The question of what will happen five years later , Schmidt said , " You want Google to answer questions like " what to do tomorrow ? " or " what work would suit me ? " - but until then , software can not answer such simple questions , because they do not know about users .
Not all internet users are aware that search engines are correctly recorded in the internet search engine , which IP address they were searched for and what page they left after searching .
Through Personalized Search , launched two years ago , users can , for example , store their own surfing background story , look back at what they were looking for , what they clicked on , and in the long run , generate more personalized hits for them - Recommendations will be based on the same logic , offering products and services to us based on our previously stated and fixed preferences .
What if they use my data against me if they look at what I do ? - users who are worried about seeing Google ’s data monopoly .
In most cases , the potential power represented by the company can be scary , not guilt , fear of punishment , desire for freedom , or rebellion against power , causes counter - reactions in Internet users .
However , it is confirmed that all the terms sought are not only recorded , but may be passed on to third parties in justified cases , in such legal cases , the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected .
The loudest example of this has been perhaps the concerted action against Brazilian pedophiles , during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about pedophiles on the community side of the community that he maintained .
However , internet users concerned about privacy rights were able to sigh in May when the company , in conjunction with the EFF electronic rights organization , successfully proved its right in court against the FBI : Google can not be forced to provide any information that the FBI has requested in secret .
( However , the federal government has successfully fought up about fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms , which have been obtained by reference to the confirmation of the child protection law that was adopted years earlier , but has not managed to obtain search lists for individual users or obtain a full web and keyword list of two months . )
Therefore , Google ’s judgment is quite controversial : they are whipped by those who fear the provision of their personal data because they feel their intimate sphere and privacy is in a state of a state that they are starting to use Google ’s services and are engaged in a rebellion against the multicompanies in conservative image .
Meanwhile , the American geek culture and its enthusiastic computer fans , activists , and users are being hunted by the next generation of big companies , the " cool corporation " , unlike its rival , Microsoft , who was world - winning for Windows , as much as they both fight for the same goal .
This can happen because Google does not request an identification code from users in a different way than Microsoft , it does not ask for money for its applications , the open , free , constantly fresh source code and program package is more accessible , younger , cooled than the official software giant practice .
However , it can also be due to the fact that geeks have a precise understanding of the very problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet , which is one of the most frequently spoken keywords of recent years , web 2.0 has been involved .
Web 2.0 is about nothing but collaborating , about leaving us with intentional clues and exploiting the communication channels available to us and while these rates vary individually , the essence is the same : we show ourselves .
An average young person can lead a profile from Facebook to Xanga , and can also connect it to other services such as Twitter or last.fm , listing his music habits , and then attach them to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm , which automatically display their latest photo galleries on Flickr or Picasa .
While we can read about several examples of cases that show : the girlfriend easily finds out about the morning photo price of the common friends circle , seeing who her cheating friend spent the evening with or fired a company employee just because she describes her honest opinion about senior management in her blog : one thing is certain , the concept of privacy has been fully re - evaluated by now .
Whoever lives online is made up of what he shows himself , and this is how we can formulate the foundation behind the behavior of today ’s young people .
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid Google monopolyium can do so ( starting with Scroogle , who uses Google ’s search system , but at the same time deliberately does not leave a trace ) .
Not a few , for example , people who do not register on social media websites on purpose to avoid being picked up , Google ’s online applications can be replaced from word editor to image manager and newsreader with alternative versions that are not connected to huge server parks and that do not create the best profile of us so far .
Public opinion is n't so secret when Google shows the protein of its teeth .
With the current $ 156 billion value of the company , IBM ( $ 140 billion ) , Intel ( $ 124 billion ) or Coca - Cola ( $ 110 billion ) , AdWords / AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenue of advertising agencies , and the services introduced at an ever - accelerating pace cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft , but also for many other software developers .
However , critical viewers find the counterpoints that act as disturbing : for example , the top management completely rejected the protest of employees , after double the corporate kindergarten fee , found the management too expensive to eat the employees at a daily rate , but it all disappears , with Google still head - on in 2006 before the Chinese government and under their agreement , the company filters all the results that violate good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime .
One of the company ’s internal rules sounds like that they do n’t pre - advertise a new service , only when it ’s already available , but it ’s certain that the problems that are for the coming months and years can move the world at a new point : while some believe that Google ’s book and magazine scanning and archiving project takes such measurements that the company will soon face the US Supreme Court , others are afraid of the Health system , in which we can build a complete health profile with our previous findings , doctors and problems .
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database can also give a good base for the next generation of science fiction writers , the popular Cory Doctorow novel Scroogled pont orwelli describes the future in which only a person can get an alarmingly good view from Google data .
Two juvenile assisting the ozd double killer in the investigation
Two juvenile police have been interviewing the police for the double murder of Ozd , and they have been suspected to assist in the disappearance of the crime , ” said the spokesperson of the County Police Headquarters in Borsod on Tuesday .
The young people have recognised the act of burden , currently accused of criminal access .
The two juvenile - according to MTI information , two girls are on parole .
Crime is punishable by imprisonment up to 5 years .
The suspect in the old double homicide - a 23-year - old local male - was arrested on Sunday .
He 's been premeditated , suspected of a desire to gain , a crime of manslaughter .
In the investigation , it turned out that the 23-year - old young man owed a large sum to a 53-year - old man .
The suspect did n't want to pay his debt , so he lured his creditor to an old - school facility last Wednesday , where he killed him , and then his nine - year - old daughter .
According to MTI 's information , the young man was prepared to commit the crime , and this is a sign that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon .
The gun and the circumstances of its use are expertly involved in investigating the police .
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – were offered to buy the share package of 100 % of the Prague Stock Exchange .
Ludwik Sobolewski , President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange , confirmed the offer , which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded from the Czechs from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange .
This is due to the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands .
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state , which wants to sell more than 60 percent of the papers in a few months .
The Czech economic newspaper E15 knows that the Polish offer is the highest amount , which has been offered to the interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange .
According to the Czech papers , the Vienna Stock Exchange , Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange , New York Stock Exchange , London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted an offer .
Petr Koblic , the Chief of Prague Stock Exchange , said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the termination of the Prague Stock Exchange .
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5 - 10 billion crowns by market experts .
According to the shareholders ' agreement , about 90 percent of the papers could be sold .
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance , with a share of about 25 % , followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l . 13.5 percent .
The financial crisis from the perspective of European press
The European papers leading to their increasingly deepening international financial crisis on Tuesday are already saying " September 11th " .
The global financial disaster is due to the US President - the Roman President La Repubblica - the President has not even been able to enlist his own party behind the proposed law , which is a result of the desperate situation .
Instead of another Pearl Harbor , mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett , it is more appropriate to talk about September 11th .
Some of the Madrid press in Washington sees the scapegoat .
According to El Mundo , the lack of political leadership in the country has led the world economy to the brink of collapse .
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing , and then the whole world will suffer .
Bush 's plan was not perfect , but the threat of the Congressional vote is that Washington does not offer a political instrument to tackle the crisis .
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place .
The threat can no longer be ignored - points to the Geneva Tages - Anzeiger .
Some states today can provide a life - form to the financial institutions that are on the rise , and with the money of taxpayers , they can save them from bankruptcy .
But if more banks collapse , like dominoes , neither funds nor any more improvisations will be sufficient .
In the long run , Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national self - esteem and centralise control over fragmented financial markets .
On Monday , more than € 100 billion was received by Sick Bay Financial Institutions – the Vienna Der Standard recalls that concerns are becoming more realistic , that European taxpayers , like Americans , should go deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis .
The EU has not seriously addressed the crisis that sweeps through the old continent as a tsunami .
" Rescue " does not have to be a hundred billion euros , but it would be nice if I recorded : in which case it is reasonable to touch taxpayers ’ money to prevent greater damage .
The Bumblebee 's flight is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technology that can avoid collisions if it was not imitation of barriers sensors in the world of nature ?
Like bees .
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan , the bumblebees gave the strategic idea to Nissan engineers to build the next generation of avoidance systems .
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo , Nissan built the BR23C bioutan - type automotive control system , a roboticized minia car , which was fitted with the properties of bees , with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that eliminates all collisions .
During the flight , each bee creates its oval - shaped personal space , which is actually very similar to our safety barrier , explained Kazuhhiro Doi , technology PR and research and development brand manager at the exhibition .
It is important to play the role of the complex eye of the uterus , which can see in all directions in more than 300 degrees of view .
To copy the function of the complex eye , engineers touched the idea of the laser telescope .
This is the BR23C , which identifies obstacles within a 180-degree field of vision within 2 meters , calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor , which immediately transforms into a action to avoid impact .
During the fractions of the second , the obstacle is detected , and then the car robot mimics the movements of the uterus , immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to avoid collision .
In any way other than the current system , this evasive maneuver is carried out in a completely intuitive way .
" If that were not so , the automotive robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles " explains Toshiyuki Andoh , Head of Mobility Laboratory and the Car - Robot Project .
It should react in an instinctive way and immediately , as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and intra - internal layer of safety safety safety loop , a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable .
The whole process should reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees .
This process must take place in a blink of an eye .
However , in a way other than bees , the deviation can not be directed up , down or diagonally , only two - dimensional , and only towards the reversibility of wheels .
In this way , instead of the endless possibilities available for bees to avoid other bees , only rotary movement and acceleration were used here , as well as slowing down as the availability of the car robot .
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy density , which means they have longer life than lithium ion .
Andoh believes that the instinctive intelligent reaction is important , not the ability to process data , even less storage .
This device only has to process and respond to a few input signals per second .
There is no need to preserve them and respond to intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres , so it is constantly using only a few dozen kilobytes of memory .
No gigabytes or memory of megabytes are needed .
This is the first step towards developing the technology for immediate evasion , which , according to Nissan ’s estimate , can enter production cars within ten years .
Additional application may be the possibility of integrating the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the car driver to the specified end goal by avoiding obstacles on the road .
They 've got a name for the expensive kid .
The written version of the economic life package bill of $ 700 billion to buy bad loans from banks is now being used in several details .
In the first round , half of the amount is spent .
According to the Eastern Coast time , during the next negotiations until Saturday midnight , Congress leaders reached a conclusion in the debate about a total of $ 700 billion lifeguards for days , Reuters stated .
We have made a major progress , said Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives , who said that only the agreement is on paper .
The package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain .
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will work and will be effective , but there is also need for further action . Pelosi said it is not about saving Wall Street , but about reversing the economy ’s cart .
The written version of the package was published on Sunday evening 8th of the Asian markets in Washington time ( i.e. , Central European time before 2:00 AM Monday ) , but did not cause spectacular uptake on the fair .
The draft legislation on the programme , named the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilisation Act , will be voted by the House of Representatives on Monday first , and then will be held at the Senate .
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening , and then the White House welcomed the news of the agreement .
We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy , said Tony Fratto , spokesperson for the White House .
The program is also different from the original Bush administration proposal , which would have been about the 700 billion dollars spent on one - on - one purchase of poor quality credit - back securities .
Now , in the first round , up to half of the 700 billion dollar amount can be spent by using 250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on Monday , from which the Ministry of Finance buys credit - backed , bad - rated securities , and another 100 billion dollars will depend on the President 's decision .
The programme will be monitored by a separate body , including the President of the Federal Reserve .
The cost of the other half of 700 billion depends on another resolution of Congress .
Under the law , the Ministry of Finance may use a combined tactic : you can buy bad loans , mortgages and mortgage securities , and other types of " poisonous " loans at the same time .
The purchase can be made in the framework of auctions and directly - the competent authorities of the Ministry .
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the financial wallet guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay the price corresponding to the expected damage .
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means to avoid systemic risks associated with the collapse of a large financial institution , whether it is a matter of $ 700 billion , or of the purchase of bad assets or of insurance or the collapse of a large financial institution .
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed , he added .
But bosses of banks in trouble and waiting for state aid can expect their exit money - which is simply called the overseas slang gold parachute - to be limited by the government .
The restrictions on payments are limited only in certain cases , and the limitations depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance .
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys an auction , an extra tax will be imposed on the gold parachute unless they retire the levitated bank manager .
When buying bad loans directly , the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that management money is not exaggerated .
It is also part of the picture that existing gold parachute contracts do not change , the restriction only applies to new ones to encourage participation in the program .
This is the first time in American history that there will be a statutory restriction on remuneration of CEOs , commented on the action by the President of the House of Representatives ’ Financial Services Committee , Democratic Party Barney Frank .
In addition , in banks participating in the programme , the state acquires the right to obtain shares , thus reducing the risk of taxpayers , since eventually they can win on the transaction as soon as the economy and the saved bank recover .
The draft law states that for the next five years the President must submit a proposal to Congress which provides for how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector .
On both sides , of course , there were those who expressed doubts about the plan .
This is not what American citizens asked us to do , i.e. it does not protect taxpayers ’ dollars , the Republican representative Darrell Issa , California .
Mary Kaptur , a Democratic colleague of Ohio , thought that the measures were being promoted by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street .

Next year , you do n't need a visa to the United States ?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will take effect around 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago , in front of the leaders of the local Hungarians .
In his opinion , " Now almost everything depends only on whether the electronic access system or control system will be built overseas in time " .
He pointed out , however , that there will be no entry permit in the new system , but tourists will have to register before departure .
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now in Washington .
He meets Minister Condoleezza Rice , who is awarded the Star of the Central Cross of the Order of Hungary and is engaged in discussions with the foreign policy advisors of the Democratic Party Barack Obama and Republican President John McCain .
Package is included with Barack Obama and McCain
Barack Obama and John McCain , both the presidents of the two major American parties , provided Sunday with the government 's $ 700 billion bank - saving aid package , but there is a politician who demands the resignation of the Minister of Finance .
After days of marathon negotiations between Congress and administration , the banking package was announced at dawn on Sunday : a principle agreement was concluded .
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to defrost the frozen credit market became the central issue of the presidential campaign .
Obama and McCain are also making themselves more suitable than their competitors to lead the country out of the economic crisis .
According to recent surveys , Obama has gained some advantage once again , with the focus of economic issues , a melting advantage of McCain , which he gained after the Republican convention , with Sarah Palin 's nomination as vice president .
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday , Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly adopt the 700 billion package law .
He stressed that the proposal includes the consumer protection passes that he also supported .
" We must act now , with responsibility (... ) your job , savings , entire industries , the whole economy 's stability is threatened , " he said in front of the 35,000 people .
He did not miss calling McCain 's economic ideas outdated .
McCain explained in the interview to ABC , " We 're all gon na have a hard time swallowing this ( ...)but doing nothing is simply not a viable way . "
The Republican senator said that the proposal included setting up the Finance Supervisory Board and limiting the severance of top leaders , and insisted .
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations , but he had daily contact with the minister .
On Sunday , Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives would hopefully vote on the bill on Monday .
The German language area
The right - wing camp is intact , only the voters became more self - conscious within the camp – thus analysing the weak role of CSU in Bavaria .
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red - black coalition .
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de )
In the online edition of the left - wing German news magazine , Franz Walter , the revolution of Bavaria , eats his parents ' articles , analyses the causes of dramatic defeat of CSU .
According to the known political scientist , CSU erosion began long before the sad Beckstein -uber duo took over office .
Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them .
The change of era is also the whole Christian democracy , and so is Angela Merkel ’s problem .
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU , but a process ended on Sunday , which was likely to be ten years ago : a citizen was eliminated from his indisputable hegemony .
For the first time in the 1950s , CSU landed at 47.7 percent in 1998 , below 50 percent .
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections , so even in the Stoiber era .
This is due to the consistent modernization of CSU in the province , which devours its parents .
Sociologists have been proposing this for 40 years , but at the pace they were wrong . However , it could not be without consequences for voters CSU ’s loyalty to secularization , educational results , the resettlement of East and North German to the developing regions of Bavaria .
Modernization is associated with the growth of opportunities , and the political consequences of this are visible .
The right camp is intact , only within the camp the voters became more self - conscious , critical , self - headed .
It is also apparent that in the last few weeks , classical civil groups were the most distant from CSU ; they were free professionals , industrialists , graduates and tertiary graduates .
The CSU 's support has shrunk below 40 percent .
Die Presse ( diepresse.com )
The conservative Viennese newspaper deals with the confused domestic political situation , which was formed after the Austrian elections , in the article " Who , with whom ?
SPÖ wants to negotiate with ÖVP .
The ÖVP forbids SPÖ to interfere in its internal affairs .
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions , the Greens do not want to discuss the coalition yet .
The election is made , now everything revolves around the coalition ; in the debate on public television , party leaders barely allowed access to their cards .
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he would like to negotiate with ÖVP .
SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - in some provinces and in social partnerships .
The question is whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer with the current ÖVP president could be imagined as a vice chancellor , was left open by Faymann veszt vesztz .
As he said , the Schüssel - Molterer course was voted out anyway .
This is not the case .
Molterer was careful to respond to red offers .
As you said , it will certainly not work if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of ÖVP .
If the party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition , it is open to the party , the questions must be discussed within the ÖVP .
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly shown himself open in all directions .
" To prevent the red - black coalition , we are ready to take government responsibility , " said Haider .
Walkthrough : You have to break the vicious circle of poverty , segregation
The European Equal Opportunities Summit was launched in Paris today , and this year France is the host of the European Union ’s Presidency .
Lívia Járóka , the Fideszes representative of the European People ’s Party , called attention to education segregation in a message to the plenary of the professional council , because this is one of the most serious violations of the Roma children and this is also the most serious obstacle to their effectiveness .
The high level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand , Minister of Employment and Social Affairs , and Vladimir Spidla , European Commissioner for Employment , Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities .
The conference was invited to take place by representatives of governments , European social partners and the most important European legal guardians and civil society organisations in the area of equal opportunities .
Járóka , according to the press office of Fidesz MEP Group , warned that , in addition to discrimination in the field of work recording , Roma are primarily excluded from the labour market due to their low education .
" The vast majority of Roma youths do not have secondary education , and only a small proportion of them can obtain higher education due to poor basic education . "
Furthermore , járóka stressed that , as a fundamental human right , education has a key role in the enforcement of other human rights .
Investing in early education in Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the European Union Member States .
The congresswoman said it is necessary to raise awareness of these connections in the broadest possible way , among Roma and non - Roma .
Because the early age of the Roma student starts school , the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market are increased ; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid after income and consumption .
" Roma should ensure the right to quality education under the right of European Union citizenship and guarantee the elimination of low quality and separate education " , said Lívia Járóka .
The Member states believe that the European Union ’s objective and action - oriented cooperation is necessary to speed up the school ’s desegregation processes immediately , and that correct observance of existing and planned anti - discrimination directives is essential .
" Poverty , segregation , the vicious circle of unemployment , the opportunities given by Roma children to the democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen " , asked Járóka .
In the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All , the European Equal Opportunities Summit , which has been held annually since last year ’s Berlin meeting , aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non - discrimination at European and Member State level .
CSU : Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October , they decide the fate of the retired Huber - Beckstein duo
Despite the ugly election failure , heads have not yet fallen , at the tops of the Bavarian CSU , the discussion of personal issues has been postponed .
Party President Erwin Huber and Provincial Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may remain in place , asking how long the pardon will last .
The fate of the tandem with 17 percent disastrous vote losses will be decided by an extraordinary party convention on the last weekend of October .
The members of the many judged pair have perceived it in any case : they do not hold all their strength to their chairs .
They were trying to calm down the angry members of the faction and base , who demanded personal consortiums one day after the " bajor tsunami " because of the loss of the absolute majority .
Five years ago , with Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career , the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent , but now , a year after the coup on Stoiber , it ran from their power to 43.4 percent .
For 46 years , CSU was a " single ruler " in Bavaria , which gave 18 percent of German GDP .
Although conservatives still matter high in the southern province of the key importance of the Hungarian economy , they will be forced to become a coalition in the future .
As one of the first signs of the restructuring within the party , the Horst Seehofer Vice - President and Federal Minister of Agriculture , as Huber 's possible successor , will also be placed in the narrow recon team , which will start talks with the liberal FDP and the Free Electoral Group , which will be organized along right - wing values , about a possible government coalition in Munich .
The strange quintessence of fate is that Gabriele Pauli , who was used by the Huber - Beckstein couple as a coup opportunity , and then was relentlessly dealt with the ambitious local politician .
CSU leaders are now turning all their energy into some kind of stabilization of Beckstein .
In the transition , Stoiber , who has been waving the threads from the background , will be actively involved , calling the 28th September the most bitter day of his political career as the former provincial Prime Minister and former CSU president .
Huber made some bile comments to CDU on Monday , he said they deserved a lot more support from the brother and sister .
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as warning for CDU and Angela Merkel .
Following the Bundestag election due in September 2009 , Merkel can not be Chancellor if CSU , which played a significant role in 2005 's national success , is somehow not recovered by common force .
According to Merkel , who is difficult to hide his disappointment due to fiasco , CSU 's soil loss will not negatively affect the Berlin Great Coalition .
Which , of course , is relative : the wounded CSU will not be easier to handle , and the Social Democrats ’ crisis will last longer .
SPD has achieved 18.6 percent of its weakest results in Bavaria since 1946 .
Lukasenkoellens:110 - 0
No opposition MP has made it to the Belarusian Parliament following Sunday elections .
According to Russian observers , this can be explained by the welfare and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukasenko , but according to the European Organization for Security and Cooperation ( OSCE ) , by the illegal acts committed at the counting of votes .
The OSCE sending 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections .
Although the law of the 10 million countries has been without the opposition for a decade , the opposition , called the United Democratic Forces ( OSS ) , was seriously hoping that , following the amendment of the Constitution , Lukasenko , which renewed its presidential mandate in the controversial purity elections in 2006 , would allow some opposition representatives to appear in Parliament for the fourth time .
The OYS also stopped the pre - considered boycott .
The opposition was behind expectations that Belarus , which was increasingly dependent on Russia , took credit for the reduction of the ever - increasing Russian gas imports , and contributed to the Russian hand - in - hand access of Beltransgaz , which had passed through the country , wanted to improve its relations with the EU , where due to the Belarusian political structure , which was considered antidemocratic , Lukasenko and several high - ranking politicians do not receive entry permits .
It was a preliminary indication that the OSCE focused on positive movements rather than shortcomings , such as the ban on a third of opposition candidates from the start , when assessing the election campaign .
However , the OSCE ’s rapid report on Monday also complained about the campaign – during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press – and especially that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes .
However , the opposition said that there was a noticeable improvement in the political system : political prisoners were released , and Minsk was willing to face a minor confrontation with Moscow , still refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and Abkhazia , which had been separated from Georgia , although Russia , with which Belarus has been forming a federal state , has been independent for a month .
- We took two steps forward , one step back , but most importantly , the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun , said Alexander Milinkevich .
The opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election said it was desirable that this would remain , despite the fact that the " power was afraid to allow even a opposition to the weightless parliament " .
The opposition does not plan protest actions in view of the results , rather attempts to deliver a message on the need for economic reforms to the voters .
- We have a lot of problems with this , we have to print opposition papers in Russia , and local authorities are rolling obstacles to dissemination , but I still see that more and more people are supporting change , among the elderly , ” Milinkevich said , referring to Lukasenko ’s regime , which considers social security to be the main result , even the layer of officially supported pensioners does not consider it appropriate .
- The country 's debt , the increase in trade deficit , is a matter of time before the social security of the " funeral home quieter " , he said .
Russian observers considered elections democratic against opposition politicians .
Sergei Lebegyev , the leader of the mission of the Independent States Community , told the Russian news agency Ria Novostyi : " People believe not words , but actions , " so the lack of opposition is proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters .
Brunetta : " Breakfast is only before work "
The Chigi Palace has uniquely rotary doors installed in its history for the entry and entry of workers .
From today , this new measure will take effect against the clients , to filter out those who block , and then they will go out for coffee on the clock .
The anti - naplopó novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi , Secretary - General of the Prime Minister 's Office .
" The rotary gates , " said Brunetta - serve better and more efficient work , reduce deficiencies and increase services "
" New , more responsible and transparent period is coming .
This is the real reform , ” said Brunetta .
The Chigi Palace will complete the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers .
Masi says " installation of rotary gates is also important from a symbolic point of view . "
We have not experienced resistance from employees - the Secretary - General confirmed : " The workers approved the measure , everyone cooperated . "
So breakfast is over on the clock , no more coffee and brioche .
Brunetta says , " A good cappuccino at 7:00 a.m. , can do wonders . "
At the University of Rome
At a meeting held , the Minister explained : " In three months , the lack of sickness in public sector workers decreased by 50 percent , which means 60,000 people in more work than one year . "
He added that the Italian administration should be more efficient
" Which , according to the minister , has been twice the size of the private sector in the last eight to ten years , and has far exceeded inflation rates . "
At the same time , thousands of public servants gathered , joining the petition supported by the Italian Association for Environment and Consumer Protection , to protest the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation .
" While the Minister of Public Administration boasts data to support the reduction of deficiencies due to illness , the " tireless slopper " war is constantly growing , " the consumer protection association writes .
Italy has gathered thousands of honest and hard - working administrative employees to declare war on the illegal regulations of the regulation . "
The regional administrative court is under attack , inter alia , the cancellation of additional sickness money for service reasons , the extension of the residence period of workers on sick leave , which means the period within which the patient can appear and several other aspects of the new provisions provided for by the Minister .
Workplace accidents : Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
In Italy , 2,500 accidents occur every day , of which 3 deaths and 27 end with permanent disability .
According to the workplace accident insurance records , nearly 1,200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007 .
Numbers show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today , and requires almost twice as many victims as manslaughter .
Today Anmil organizes the 58th day of the victims of accidents at work in all counties of Italy , traditionally held on the second Sunday of October , to draw the attention of institutions , social organisations and mass communication to this dramatic problem .
" The worrying data provided by Anmil and the tragic events of the last few days also support the fact that prevention has a very important role in the workplace accidents , " said President Giorgio Napolitano , in his message to Pietro Mercandelli , President of the National Association of Accidental Rokkantak at Work .
The head of state sincerely praised the " long - standing commitment of the association to prevent prevention at work , the protection of the workers who suffered an accident , the help of the families of victims and the impossibility of public opinion " .
" Natural and honestly distributed outrage is caused by the tragedies of this nature , which attract the interest of the media and the public , but in reality , we have to face dramatic cases that are repeated over and over again every day . "
Napolitano openly confesses : " We are undoubtedly resourceless , education and information financing is crucial .
Initiatives within the school are of particular importance , which aim to direct the education of young people on the verge of entering the world of work .
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon , not to let the attention of the social importance of the issue be reduced , and to have more effective legislation that must be enforced .
The president of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed on his part , " how serious the accidents at work with death are , all of us , socially relevant , and from the institutions , they require that this be done as soon as possible . "
" Data on accidents at work shows slight improvement , but the number of deaths of this nature is still incredibly high " , said Pietro Mercandelli , President of Anmil .
" We do n't want this trend to happen , but it 's a decline , because it 's just the most tragic thing that happens when attention is coming down . "
" We believe that at general level we still do not do everything we can to overcome the phenomenon , which could be solved through a complex action programme .
We believe that more rigorous supervision and control would be needed , he stressed Mercandelli and more pronounced intervention in the field of labour training , starting from school education . "
" More efforts are needed to inform and make public public aware , " he added .
What would be most necessary , however , is a more responsible employer environment for a phenomenon that poses a social problem . "
After that , Mercandelli criticized " the gradual deterioration of the damage net to victims of accidents at work " and the " aid direction towards which the system has drifted in recent years " .
" The goal is to return the safety of the insurance to the workers , because the fate of the accident victims can not depend on the arbitrary and where the action of the lawmakers is handing out " .
MP3 players can cause hearing loss
Listening to portable devices with long and high volume , such as MP3 devices , can cause permanent hearing loss
In its report published in Brussels , the European Commission , on the basis of a professional opinion published today by the Scientific Committee on New and New Identified Health Risks ( SCENIHR ) .
" The expert opinion shows that 5 - 10 percent of people who spend five years a day listening to their portable music player with a high volume " can be read in the explanation .
" It is worrying that young people who use high volume portable music players and mobile phones in mass and often , are not aware that they can damage their hearing irreversibly , " said Meglena Kuneva .
“ Scientific surveys indicate an indisputable risk to which we urgently have to respond ” , the Commissioner added .
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information about them .
In light of the opinion mentioned , we must also review existing control systems to ensure that they are able to operate with proper efficiency and keep up with the latest technologies . "
Brussels invited the independent scientific committee to explore the problem , given the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise they caused .
“ Researchers confirm that we have cause for concern . The European Commission is ready to examine , in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders , what possible measures could be introduced to protect children and young people exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices , ” the member of the Committee said .
The current European safety regulation defines the maximum noise level that portable music players can emit in 100 dB , but there is still growing concern about hearing loss resulting from excessive use of such sound sources .
However , there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise storage , which can significantly reduce these hearing impairments .
The EU Scientific Committee states in its expert opinion that for those users who use portable player devices who listen to music with high volume ( more than 89 decibels ) for five hours a week , noise content exceeds the maximum current value for noise at work .
If you listen to music for a longer time under similar conditions , after five years there is a risk of permanent hearing loss .
This affects about 5 - 10 % of portable users , which can mean 2.5 - 10 million people in the EU .
Rome , Alemanno sets up the committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today , until March , results can be expected in June .
This schedule was set up by the Municipality of Budapest for the functioning of the Committee entitled " Future of the City of Rome " , which met this morning at the new headquarters behind Caracalla ’s baths .
In the next six months , President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission members will be working out Rome 's guidelines .
Following the final word in March , the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee to present the strategic plan officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June .
" This is a completely independent committee , in which all political , social and cultural ideas are represented , " emphasizes Alemanno , and its task is to develop proposals for Rome ’s development ideas , which political decision makers , therefore the Assembly and the Municipality Committee , can rely on .
There is no conflict of competence , we just wanted a platform where great plans could be made for the benefit of Rome .
In March , after his work , the committee will be dissolved , because he has a mandate for a fixed period .
In June , we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of Rome ’s Headquarter , the Mayor said .
For those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary , referring to the lack of binding force of the opinion it has set up , Alemanno says : " It all depends on the work the Commission will do and what quality of proposals it will put on the table .
If the quality is proven to be appropriate , as in France , in the case of the Attal Committee , which I take for granted in Rome , the contribution it provides will play an important role .
The power of politics is often disintegrated in the management of daily affairs and in the management of urgent cases from time to time .
In contrast , we , taking into account the perspective , look further and plan for a longer term and are committed to the development and future of Rome . "
The mayor of Rome wishes to point out that " this is not a useless " water head " by the Commission , as it is absolutely free , it will not cost the Roman citizens a Euro , but it will serve as a thought stimulation and aim to involve the best minds of the capital " .
Alemanno said that " there is an open - ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump in the quality it so desperately needs , thinking in a united spirit about its future " .
The future in which the mayor of Rome emphasizes : " it will not only be limited to the current municipal frameworks , but also look far away " , we see not only the future metropolis and the capital status in it , but also " the role that Rome , Europe and the Mediterranean region can play as the capital and which it must fill . "
Obama ? The first anti - American president .
An American politician who declared himself independent wrote , " Barback Obama will be the second anti - American president .
The first Jimmy Carter to destroy the American economy with his decisions and to have a close relationship with the enemy Islam ( as he still does today as a private man ) .
As the election time approaches , attacks on Obama are thickened .
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet : " This man is full of ambitions .
Obama is insolent in believing that he can gain the highest public dignity of a nation with a total of two governors and five senators in the past ! "
These attacks are actually meaningless ; of course they are racist , but they do not answer the question of voters whether they will be a good president . Then there are polls : they indicate that Obama will win with a significant advantage .
In this case , there are those who listen to your emotions and not your mind .
Inside the South States , a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in its editorial : we know well who the true American patriot is voting for in the polling pod .
The American way of thinking appears here , which remains hidden until the last moment .
" Just talk what you want , we 'll know where we 'll put the twins , Obama or McCain . "
Some people swear to God , if Obama wins , they 'll leave the United States .
Never heard such words until now , when the success of the black candidate is almost certain .
However , despite all these cleverness , the Democrats are a winning weapon by George Bush .
1500 people were asked what were the errors that Bush made during his term of office?89 percent replied that Iraq .
America changes .
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was kicked to the bottom by flying home .
In Iraq , 4500 soldiers died , and Americans did not have to pack .
The majority still believe Iraq was Bush 's weakness .
There 's a huge task for the man who 's replacing George W.
USA : the economic collapse is felt by journalists , the time of the restrictions has come in the editorial staff . Many people blame the Internet for the " death of the printed press " .
The PEW research institute asked five hundred American journalists how they felt about the future situation and the spiritual power of their profession .
Well , almost every journalist is pessimistic about his future right now .
However , they did not clearly state that their concerns had decreased in terms of authenticity .
They do n't feel as isolated as they used to .
The problem with American journalists is money .
They believe the 2008 crisis is a failure of a powerless economic model .
Other serious problems are the restrictions on newsroom , i.e. the editorial staff that makes the newspaper .
If we do not want traditional journalism , in the sense that the great public understands this , to minimize , this problem needs to be solved - said journalists .
Nowadays , American journalism is characterized by a well - visible and complex pessimism .
Sixty percent of journalists and top leaders working in the printed press are convinced that national zsásztisztika is on the wrong path .
At local level , 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions .
Printed versus electronic press .
The press staff is not having any difficulty seeing where the web is going .
The biggest publishers are making their way to the Internet , which many people believe is the " killer " of the printed press .
The " economic pressure " detected by journalists grew to 79 percent .
The 500 journalists asked to vote for technology , hoping that it might benefit the hackers .
Today , in the American press industry , there is a gap between editorial leaders , the directors , and the correspondents working for them .
At national level , 56 percent of managers are confident that their correspondents share their information with others , while at local level this rate can only be 23 percent .
Some people put this in a relationship with a safe place to work .
At national level , 47 percent of managers are afraid that they will lose their jobs within three years .
In the case of journalists , this rate is 30 percent .
In America , the question of " safe work " is on a team level ( for our editors , ed . ) .
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts .
In a vast nation like the United States with 300 million inhabitants , where thousands of newspapers , magazines , radio , TV and Internet operators operate , employers usually offer as much as they want , so the thing works on a " must or not " basis .
Director general payrolls are paid high , and editors can earn ten thousand dollars a month , in addition to paying pension and health insurance fees .
Freedom , however , works on a rather complicated principle : in the first year x day , in the third one , until after a certain time it reaches the maximum of 15 days .
But American journalists , according to their own admission , often get sick during the year .
Everything depends on the climate .

Carmelo Rinaudo , the President of the Second Criminal Division of the Court of Rome , rejected the application of Danilo Coppola , who was a resident of the city , who wanted to go from Grottaferrat to a Roman apartment .
Coppola is under investigation for economic bankruptcy in the context of an investigation into the agreement on the exchange of shares of Unipol - BNL .
Last week , during the proceedings against him , house arrest was lifted and changed to a residence ban on Grottaferrata .
His lawyers , Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella , requested that the real estate professional be able to move from the rural town to his apartment in the capital city .
However , the court considers that these commissions ( which the prosecutor has made a proposal to reject ) would allow the company to influence its affairs and access the evidence against it .
The elite in danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $ 700 billion rescue package submitted by the White House : a significant part of Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy .
This is also supported by yesterday 's New York Times , which informs us that due to the current crisis , there has been a breakout within the Republican Party , which is increasingly divided between traditional , restrained , East Coastal attitude to support federal institutions and business circles and a growing new trend against Washington and the financial world in the mid and South .
This Directive was critical in the House of Representatives ' vote .
However , the above event is just one of the major changes that the economic restructuring still ongoing is predicting or letting you see , and not only in the United States , but also throughout the Western world , and perhaps beyond .
It seems that the crisis , both in the US and Europe , only accelerates the already incubating phenomena that have been solidifying in this new atmosphere and finally being revealed .
The first such phenomenon is reactualization , re - entry into public awareness of the dual category of state sovereignty , about the re - establishment of the economy .
The crisis affects banking institutions that are close to foreign countries , but mainly , and fairly widely , bring people and families with them that live in a single country .
This is a direct political difficulty for those on the government : what to respond to the difficulties and protests of those who choose other people .
So the crisis seems to be worldwide in an economic sense , but in a political sense it is almost exclusively national .
It seems that political internationalism is essentially outside the coastline : the European Union is a gem of this , which is unable to designate a single political direction , in the midst of different interests and different national strategies .
So everyone is waiting for the intervention , the rescue package , the recovery and the new rules , but especially the opening of funds : because only the individual states have economic resources , a financial set that can make things right .
They have the tools and the authority to use them : in circumstances where they are , they have two invaluable sources that are likely to be never held by any other market or any international organisation .
In addition , the new focus placed by the crisis on the nation - state is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times attaches an increasingly important factor that is closely related to this element : this is territoriality .
Paradoxically , while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of increasingly sophisticated technology , and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world , we had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were less abstract than water , crop and petroleum .
From things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another , yet fully linked to a defined area , one area .
So whoever controls the area has a lot more cards than who was born in a place where there is no crop , no oil and no water .
I would also go to the second novelty , which suggests a kind of breaking line .
Whoever says that territory , state , government , necessarily says politics , in other words , leadership .
From this point of view , the economic crisis seems to produce two intertwined phenomena :
On the one hand , the objective recognition of the need for authentic leadership is for those who can handle the events .
On the other hand , it brings the total loss of credit to current leadership , especially economic leaders , who have proved to be completely unfit and proved that many of them are still obscure .
The two together have even deeper significance and in some sense more disturbing : the feeling of loss of credit , impatience , inertia and separation , which affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries .
It seems that the conviction of the population in an ever wider range is that the time of the social elite at the top of the day has expired , even before they have gone out , before they have their actions , experiences , lifestyles , culture , in the complex sense of the word , they would have taken it .
In short , the demand for leadership , in a plagued form , is a diverse but strong delegation movement of the ruling class and the traditional political system . This is manifested in the unexpected " outbursts " of voters , or in the sudden changes in the public mood . Such as the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria , the collapse of the working party unit in Britain or the rebellion of U.S. Congressmen against Bush ( and perhaps the victory of the Italian right ) .
It seems that the traditional elite , with its parties , programs , and even say that , along with its customs , press and renowned intellectuals , is becoming less and less understanding , therefore , less and less able to represent what has been going on in the deeper layers of Western society for some time .
Despite all this , " talking about the impending rebellion of the masses " would be a bit of a stretch .
But it 's not worth seeing with your eyes open .
We can walk on the wall with super - strong glue
With a super - powerful glue , you can overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider - Man .
This is the goal of several American research centers and a group of four institutions is close to the solution .
With a glue cassette of only 2.5 square centimeters , researchers managed to glue a 100 kilos body to a vertical wall and keep it there .
The American journal TANULMÁNY - Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton , Akron , Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory .
The material invented by the group of scientists was born from the further development of special , n. n. carbon nanotubial materials that existed earlier .
" The principle of glue operation must be imagined as a packet of spaghetti - like piping systems , " says Zhong Lin Wang , researcher at Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta .
Researchers drew the idea from the foot covered with the gecko microscopic blinds , which provides perfect grip for the animal .
Testing with various materials , such as glass , teflon and sandpaper , has supported the fact that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the soles of these reptiles , but at the same time " it is easily separated from the wall " , explains Liming Dai , researcher at the engineering faculty of the University of Dayton .
FALON JÁRNI?- " This material can be useful as a temporary glue " - adds Liming Dai .
We can walk through the wall , just like Spiderman?Maybe so , but researchers think about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices , because carbon nanotubes are good at driving heat and electricity .
Find additional applications in the field of space research .
Superheroes can wait .
The MÁSIK KUTATATATA - Berkeley University of California is also conducting experiments with a new adhesive .
According to the article published in the American Chemical Society , California scientists presented a hair fiber - like , microfiber glue that goes through self - cleaning during movement on the surface , thus always providing perfect grip .
Medicines?Fruit juice is prohibited !
You have to take care of grapefruit , orange and apple juice .
These high vitamin - containing , especially popular thirst drinks in summer , if they are added to the body together with certain life - saving medicines , change their absorption , amplify or reduce their effect depending on the case .
The professor announced at the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia , a glass of grapefruit , orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life - saving medicines , preventing their beneficial effects and jeopardizing the health of the patient .
Grapefruit juice has already been placed on the bench of the accused , when it turned out to be able to enhance the effects of some antibiotics , antihistamine , anti - anxiety , heart rhythm control and neurosystems to a toxic level .
COMPUTER RESULTS - Two years ago , the Italian Institute of Pharmaceuticals itself published the news in its official bulletin and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with these consumption and to pay attention to what they drink when taking drugs such as Diazepam or Metadon .
NO GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers , orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines .
A list of active ingredients that are being prevented from absorbing grapefruit and other juices could be included in the long term .
Michele Carruba , professor of Pharmaceutical Department of Milan State University , calls for this : " These discoveries are usually immediately indicated to various national and international pharmaceutical institutions who , if necessary , ensure that the information contained in the information provided by the given body is changed .
That is why we should always read the information on the drug that we intend to collect , and if something is not understandable , let us not let ourselves be influenced , but clearly ask our doctor or pharmacist , ” said Ansa Institute ’s specialist .
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for analysing the territorial context of commercial models and economic activity .
55-year - old Neoceynesian Krugman , teaches at Princeton University and is a well - known publicist of the New York Times .
Krugman is one of the most fierce critics of Bush 's economic and foreign policy measures .
After a few months of the September 2001 terrorist attack , when Enron went bankrupt , Krugman predicted in his New York Times article that the latter event would have more fateful consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of Twin Towers .
This forecast has caused a lot of debate , and has been put on the economist ’s eye several times , but now we know it was accurate .
" I am surprised and a little shocked at how quickly the public interest had exceeded the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom , " Krugman said at the end of 2002 .
The member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank , Lorenzo Bini Smaghi , said Krugman is a " precious economist " , but at the same time he spreads his criticisms against the excessive liberalism of Bush government in a rather " aggressive manner . "
Open Office , the third edition was worth the " Anti - Microsoft " package
Today , OpenOffice.org 3.0 is a personal productivity - enhancing , open - code application that targets ever wider layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office , from home to office users , free - time and public administration .
Following the work of SUN Microsystem supervised and voluntary developers for almost a year , the new Open Office comes to the public with more news : outside the welcome screen and the rethought , less Spartan user interface , it offers more relevant new features such as compatibility with Apple Mac OS X and support the new ODF ( Open Document Format)1.2 format according to the ISO standard .
Particular attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007 , so Open Office can open new extended Microsoft documents ( .docx,.xlsx,.pptx ) .
Interesting , some modules have specific features , such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations . This may be useful when sending files via email . Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphic module , keeping the page layout .
On the same interface , we can create " hybrid PDF " documents that combine the typical Adobe format with table managers or text editor elements .
The sharing within the apps has also been through a number of improvements : the spreadsheet supports the common use of workbooks , but prevents each other from overwriting their work .
Some companies are already working to make some of the features of OpenOffice available from the Internet ( the cloud , cloud ) so that the final version may be presented in the coming weeks .
The Italian version , after being added to the English version on mirror sites since Friday , can be downloaded from : http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
The program package is also available for Linux , other than the usual Windows and Mac OS operational systems .
On request , we can also take over the installation CD at home or at work .
Free is probably the biggest attraction for the spread of the home application , but the Open Office suite is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector , as it can count on many administrative and school projects .
There is no lack of education , consulting and service services ideal for small and medium - sized enterprises , which can open up new business prospects .
Open Office consists of five core modules : Writer , Word - matching word editor ; Calc , a table manager for Excel ; Impress , Powerpoint presentation ; Dbase is the most famous , Access database manager ; and finally Draw is the graphical module .
The 2008 target is to reach 5 million downloads . But if you consider that with the release of the new version we are already at 3,600,000 , this number will probably be higher than expected .
Kohl 's results are positive , this is the fourth doping case .
In the last part of the Tour de France , one of the participants , Austrian Bernhard Kohl , who was competing for the Gerolsteiner team , won the best mountain - level t - shirt , as well as the bronze medal .
The news came out on the Equipe Internet newspaper .
26-year - old Kohl is the fourth driver , Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol , and the German , also Gerolsteiner racer Stefan Schumacher , who gave positive results at the Cera test of the third generation version of the EPO .
Kohl 's blood sample , like the tests he 's been doing in the last few weeks , has been studied by laboratories in Lausanne and chat innenabry .
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result , the Austrian loses its third position and is banned from racing for two years according to the regulations .
The report on the positive results of Kohl ’s third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry , Head of the French Anti - Dopping Agency , and announced to the Associated Press News Agency that he indicated a positive doping result to the Austrian authorities .
The 26-year - old Austrian managed to stand behind Carlos Sastre in Spain and Cadel Evans in the US , and won the best dot - dot shirt for mountain - goer .

Italy has recently changed from emigrant countries to one of the most popular targets of reluctant immigrants .
This is why the New York Times is pushing this question , based on the case of young Abdul William Guibre in Burkina Faso , who was murdered in Milan last month because he stole a box of biscuits , dedicates a long article to the debate about racism in Italy .
The case is well described as what the New York Times calls " paradox " : in the northern regions , " the highest integration and the highest employment " , however , " the " anti - immigration and the North League 's support " are also the strongest in the country .
In support of the increased tension between Italians and immigrants , NYT also refers to cases in Milan , Parma , Rome , Ciampino and Castel Volturno .
In fact .
The new laws demanded by the League , which would make the reins closer to immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants , were set as examples of mood changes in Italy .
The trend also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic : " Giorgio Napolitano met with Benedict XVI at the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the state and the Church should cooperate to overcome racism " .
Students suffer from expensive rental fees , up to 900 euros in a room
The market for accommodation for university students is not affected by the crisis .
According to the latest survey by Sunia , the Vacation Renters Union , a student can pay up to € 900 for a single room in Milan , 700 in Florence , 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome .
" The phenomenon has now taken such amazing sizes , which , due to the considerable total costs of families , excludes a wide range of students from the possibility of learning , " explains Laura Mariani , Head of the Sunia Study Office . " In these cities , high demand from students has distorted the market to such a extent that a general process of growth has been launched against local residents . "
In most cases , real estate offers include a series of irregularities : contracts with no registered lease limits , with an associated apartment .
According to Sunia , an extraordinary measure would be needed to allow the taxation system to maximise prices by reviewing the taxation system .
The survey shows that in Milan , Brianza , a bed is also charged 450 euros ; the price of the single room is 650 euros ( the area of Bande Nere ) up to 800 euros ( Lambiate , Udine and Fiera ) , but it can reach 900 euros ( the vicinity of Vittoria ) .
In Florence , a bed is average of 350/400 euros , a room is about 700 .
In Bologna , where most students live in the neighborhood near the university , a bed is 250/280 euros if they are double and 370 - 500 euros when it comes to single rooms .
In Rome , in areas close to central universities ( San Lorenzo , Piazza Bologna ) , about 600 euros are requested for a single and 450 for a double room bed .
Something cheaper ( € 550 for one - person room)Prices in other universities ( Ostiense and Cinecittà ) .
Save some in suburban districts : 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina , Centocelle and other similar districts .
In Naples , a bed is charged 300/450 euros , one room from 400 to 600 euros . The price is highest in the vicinity of Policlinico , Vomero and Colli Aminei .
In Bari , a bed is charged 250/350 euros and at least 350 for a single room .
In smaller cities , prices are at absolute value , but represent a higher weight within the urban budget .
In cities such as Perugia , where students outside the EU often look for accommodation , there is another disorder : the rent for foreign students is about 25 - 30 percent higher than for Italian tenants .
Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso , the old cinema child 's time has been sacrificed in the cities
Traditional cinemas are closed for Multiplexes .
" A city without cinemas , blind city , like a face without eyes . "
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively showcase everything that goes on in the Italian cities , but also in rural regions .
The suppression of cinemas - the appearance of large , multi -term cinemas in the suburbs , and as a consequence , the failure of one - of - a - kinders in the city centre - seems inevitable and irreversible , but at the same time bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime .
When places with historical and memory disappear , " it 's like a friend leaving , a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences , " says Cinema Paradiso director . The film , which was an Oscar award twenty years ago , and the grand prize of the Cannes festival , tells Tornator 's story of a small - town cinema 's másodpercarist story , the yearning , after a movie experience that may have been lost forever .
The largest association of operators , the data provided by Anec , has been clear : 316 traditional film theatres have closed in the last five years . The biggest losses could be recorded in films in large cities : 10 film theatres closed in Florence , 9 in Milan , Naples , Bologna and Rome , 6 in Turin , and 5 in Palermo .
Among the most affected regions , Emilia - Romagna is at the forefront , which lost 82 single -term cinema , followed by Tuscany ( 44 ) and Lombardy ( 41 ) .
And that the number of newly opened multi -term cinemas in these three regions of Italy is the highest in the past five years : the number of rooms in Lombardy has risen by 195 , 81 in Tuscany and the same in Emilia - Romagna .
" The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally , " says Anec President Paolo Protti . " It is okay to build new facilities , but it is also necessary to ensure the survival of existing ones , because when a city cinema closes , not all walkers are willing to go to multiplexes .
Not to mention the unloaded financial funds for the support of operators : the expiry of the state is worth around € 10 million .
It is also shameful in ethical and moral terms that the government does not comply with the laws in force .
The market would need 16 - 18 million euros a year . "
This is the first Italian city to decide in its concern over closures to protect and boost one - room films in the suburbs and downtown , to address the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec .
The provisions include tax benefits to operators and benefits to the public to promote accessibility : viewers can drive into restricted zones and park in certain parking spaces with a discounted tariff .
" I like this initiative , " says Giuseppe Tornatore - " and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna 's example , even by introducing other measures .
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas , in order to be able to fight the domination of multiplexes , need to improve the sound and image quality , because today ’s audience is more demanding .
Protecting the traditional cinema was always an important question for me : closing Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the spark that made me finally do Cinema Paradiso , although I had thought about it for 10 years .
I have lived in Rome for 25 years , so when I go to via Nazionale before the closed Rialto or Quirinale , to see no posters blackened from the dust , I turn my head .
Tight ties between politics andndrangheta , arrested Mayor Gioia Tauro
" The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in the local government decisions . "
Severe charges were made against the California Anti - Mobility Directorate judges Gioia Tauro 's mayor and deputy mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone , and Rosarno 's mayor Carlo Martelli , who were arrested this morning for external involvement in the criminal network .
The handcuffs were also placed in the hands of Gioacchino Piromalli , a senior mediator between the clan and the administration , and a lawyer nephew of the same name as the boss , who had been convicted of participating in a mafia crime organization and was paid for 10 million euros .
" The disregard of all legal and moral rules , what is more , for good taste , " is written by the state 's attorneys .
" So the clan would have officially had access to the city hall , which would have given us further opportunity to control and manage the administration , which is already significant .
Agazio Loiero , President of the Calabrian Region General Assembly , does not hide that there is a " number of collusion between local institutions and organized underworld " in the region : there are areas where the spread of the Mafia is stronger than elsewhere where collusion is almost inevitable .
However , many local politicians resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta , they are the heroes who remain clean ' .
The arrests this morning are the continuation of the July events , when the police announced that they had managed to decapitate the Piromalli clan .
At the end of April , local politicians were exempted from their mandate to administer the municipality . The Gioia Tauro municipal committee was once dissolved in 1991 , even because of the alleged concentration between organized crime and local government .
Giorgio Dal Torrione , the Christian Democratic mayor of the dissolution , was appointed to the right - central coalition in the second round of 2006 .
He cried out a scandal when the County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee .
Marco Minnini , the deputy minister of the Interior , was brought to justice and accused of planning everything for political purposes . But the court stated in the arrest warrant signed this morning that the Piromalli clan had gone to the point of demanding a change in the A3 project .
The wire ordered against Dal Torriona shows that the state 's attorneys write that " he was willing to meet the demands of an enterprising group of the Piromalli family , which is well known to be close to the Piromalli family , to make decisions of the municipality to the clan . "
The energy comes from the waves , and now the great ones come
An inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70 % of the planet 's surface , and which is just discovered by large international energy companies
Waves , sea currents , floods , and renewable energy sources , which have been laid out by giants like Chechron who are now trying to put their hands on it .
For hundreds of years , they have been searching for ways to gain energy from the sea movements . In the ' 70s , during the first oil crisis , research increased .
Around 1980 , when oil prices decreased , the idea of using marine energy was put aside , but today the demand for environmental protection and the rise of oil prices again gives the sector a new boost .
The London World Energy Council ( WEC ) 2007 estimates that 15 percent of the world 's electricity needs could be covered by facilities that utilize waves of sea .
This amount is twice what the nuclear power plants are currently producing .
And there 'd still be currents and floods .
The giants are in the swing .
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement on a power plant to be established in Northern Portugal in 2005 .
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signature was announced .
Two years have passed since then , and more and more companies have voted for marine energy , including those who have been committed to supporting traditional energy .
" Chevyron studies the technologies that utilize the energy of the oceans and consider the possibility of cooperation with us , " said the spokesperson of an associate enterprise in the American oil giant , Wall Street Journal , who is an economic newspaper .
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of the license issued by the US Energy Commission to start the Alaskan project for the utilisation of marine energy .
The thing is not small , especially considering the fact that the US is in the middle of oil production in Alaska , and even President Bush recently launched a plan for further drilling .
In addition to Chechron , Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also on the way to extract energy from the sea .
The technology is waiting for a development .
Experts say that it is still primitive technology , because the energy from the sea does not dispel any doubts about environmental impact .
The existing facilities , such as Portugal or Scotland , are all small , and therefore do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem .
However , to generate energy on a larger scale , it is necessary to produce facilities that have a significant environmental impact .
There are several options : Ocean Power uses , for example , a connected buoy system .
The waves and the buoys are driven and moved by the pistons and cylinders placed in them to hydraulic pressure .
The pressure is turning a turbine , which feeds a generator .
The electricity is on the cables under the sea to land .
There are currently four similar facilities in the planning phase , waiting for federal authorisation .
Verdant Power , however , has already started power generation for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six turbine in the East River Seaboard in New York .
At the rate of the current , the water movement turns the shovels of the turbine , and this rotation feeds the generator .
Verdon said that he had a long list of partners waiting for the permission to use energy .
Waves after tide .
Currently , discriminated attention is deserved by the possibility of exploiting the tide .
Although it is a periodic phenomenon , the tide is more foreseeable than wind , sun , or waves , therefore it can be considered a more reliable source of energy .
New York , Maine and Alaska , and other coastal states spent $ 7.5 million in 2008 , to exploit the energy supplied by the tide .
