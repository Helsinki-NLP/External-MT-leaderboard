Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro area countries, inflation was higher than expected in November, with an annual rate of inflation of 3.1% after the 2.6% in October, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been down to just 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not cut the key interest rate, which it believes will favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment to create an inflationary spiral.
The ECB is committed to keeping inflation below 2%, or at least close to the 2% mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in a dilemma: it must "stop" inflation in order to rule out the need for further action.
In November, the inflation rate in Germany reached a 12-year record high of 3.3%, while in Spain it rose from 3.6% to 4.1%.
The rise in inflation in the euro area is due to higher food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat prices rose 88 percent, and soybean prices also reached a record high since 1973.
The price of cooking oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil has risen 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
The ECB forecasts that inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but expects a fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts expect inflation to be 3 percent over the next three to four months, but the annual average is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup identifies government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support had grown significantly by early December, with the party having the largest base for the first time since 2002, while support for the Socialists reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference is clear among party-loyal voters, thanks to the high degree of determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71%) are in favour of the MSZP compared to a fifth (20%).
The MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry barrier: they make up two per cent of the total population.
The number of party voters has increased by one percent in both camps.
Compared with the last low, general economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who rate the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" been so high (41 per cent), while another 46 per cent consider it "pretty bad".
After a more hopeful outlook in spring and summer, the families are once again pessimistic about the change in their financial situation.
The majority of the population expects the situation to worsen further next year, with only one tenth expecting an improvement.
A December Gallup poll found that 71% of respondents rated the prime minister's work as "rather bad than right", a historic high.
Thirteen percent of those surveyed have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters of Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% mistrust of the head of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be controlled without a change of government.
While 35% of voters voted to keep the government and the prime minister in office after the October riots, this figure has now fallen to just 20%, while the relative majority (33%) see the solution only in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent said they would "certainly" participate, and another 20 percent would "probably" cast their vote.
By comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55% would "certainly" go to the polls, while another 15% would consider their participation "probable".
74% would vote against tuition, 79% against internship fees, and 84% against hospital fees.
If the group of those who "certainly" took part in the referendum were included, the shares of those who opposed tuition, internship and hospital fees would be 81, 84 and 89 per cent, respectively.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budapest shopping area have maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budapest shopping triangle, the price of the usual "Napi" Christmas basket has also risen by 16 percent this year, but all hypermarkets have recorded price increases of over HUF 1,000.
After the "swing" in food prices last December, the percentage increase has not been drastic compared with the high level it was at the beginning.
However, it is certainly a deterrent to consumers that what they paid for last year at a price far below HUF 9,000 is not available this year for even HUF 10,000.
The price of the 'Napi' basket exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF threshold by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was HUF 6,800.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as in the previous year, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy seeds rose sharply.
Meal and bread prices were in line with the data of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, but at Auchan there were 1 kg of bread oats for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop for the product below 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola pledge below 200 forints, so the drink including pledge cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in this year's "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations show that Cora raised the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 percent compared to last year's Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan each raised 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the most expensive basket of the current year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the most expensive basket of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.
The average price increase in the previous year was still HUF 1,206.00, but the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices at last Christmas.
This was the situation which affected trade: it seemed that the department stores were not able to decide correctly which price range to apply to the individual articles, since the effect of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unpredictable.
(If the trader does not plan well for the speed of a product, he may lose substantial profits in the price range which depends on the intensity of traffic.)
The increase in the price of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical due to VAT that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than the previous year, and even the cheapest one had a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared with the last two Christmas seasons, prices have risen catastrophically, with the price of everyday consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This again does not necessarily confirm the data of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office recorded an increase in price of more than 30% over a period of 12 months.
So, in addition to flour, eggs are also used.)
However, if you look in the "Napi" shopping cart, it seems almost impossible to do so in the latter case, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has risen by hardly more than 10 per cent even in the worst case.
Clearly, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the fast-moving suppliers - after all, they have been able to pass on the drastic price increase to the multinationals.
In the golden triangle of trade, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are reported all the time.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
They buy in large quantities from all kinds of foodstuffs, and they sell them on pallets.
On Wednesday morning, all three department stores were in endless lines at the checkout, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower frequency of customers, so many multinationals complain to opinion pollsters that they cannot even achieve the sales they planned, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are being saved
More than a thousand infections in hospitals were recorded this year as a result of improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overloading of staff - all factors that are not particularly conducive to curbing infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, savings are also made on disinfectants.
A MRSA infection was recently diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was admitted to hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
There was a similar infection earlier this year.
The injured man of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but soon afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection.
By December 10, 1,094 infections caused by multi-drug resistant pathogens had been reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System from hospitals, according to Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been reported in hospitals, but the unknown number is likely to be higher.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium is carried by about a third of people in their noses without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as strep throat, tonsillitis, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics and are easily curable.
However, if the drugs are used too heavily or inadequately, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics become resistant and can spread rapidly in hospitals under the right conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened or permanently dysfunctional immune systems, but also in the elderly or in patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infections or blood poisoning, or sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA infection is not a special case, such incidents are part of the daily life of the hospital.
Infection should not be confused with epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA does not exist only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks when they are treated, and we have the antibiotics needed for treatment", says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are tested for MRSA upon admission to hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for curbing the emergence or spread of the multi-drug resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is predominantly found in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients admitted and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not as commonly practiced.
Not least because the state health insurance fund does not provide any funding for this study.
Most cases, therefore, do not come to light until the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, says the medical director of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but in Hungary there are also guidelines on the treatment of certain infections and pathologies.
Antibiotic therapies are intended to be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the agent, but hospitals do not always comply with this directive.
Among outpatients or those in primary care, microbiological sampling is even rarer, says Karolina Böröcz.
The savings are made on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by caregivers.
This is why handwashing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but domestic hospitals do not always have the ability to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often crowded, the beds are close together, although epidemiologically speaking, they should be separated by at least 1.5 metres.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less financially well-off hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are fewer nurses, many patients - all factors that almost favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections have been shown to be much less frequent, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections are costing health insurance companies a lot of money to control, so they're being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its control, was included in the government programme.
Initial indications are that the programme is successful - published data show that the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the development of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
The death-link police chief wasn't drunk.
The official report on the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the 22nd district has now been issued.
The now-retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car crash on Tuesday, was neither drunk nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the spokesman for the Budapest prosecutor's office, on Friday, after the official report on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the preliminary investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he took the wheel.
The former police chief drove his own car into Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district and ran over a 55-year-old man who was crossing the street at an unmarked spot.
(According to the StVO, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the steering wheel is secondary even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip.)
The pedestrian died of his injuries after being admitted to hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, resigned from his duties and requested retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth a total of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday, to be used for education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework in 2006 to finance transport and environmental protection projects with Cohesion Fund grants. e loan agreement of EUR 100 million was signed earlier, and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be used for the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has committed a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement for EUR 50 million, which will be mainly used for research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the 4 line of the metro.
It was agreed that once Hungary had clarified the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, the original contract and any modifications would be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary, totalling EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rates are linked to EURIBOR and the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, without commissions.
Bulgaria, the real estate haven of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all Europe is looking attentively at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying in the EU's still cheapest market, but rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most sought-after place to buy property in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and seaside homes.
Among the mountains, the most popular are the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, while the seaside regions include Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar, the racetrack, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik is also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior will attract investors sooner or later, for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the extremely favorable area of Russe also shows more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golfing destinations in Europe, attracting tourists in the summer and winter seasons as well as in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy property in Bulgaria are also looking for a change in their lifestyle.
The majority of buyers are English, but there are also interested buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties for 50 to 100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5 to 15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility and communication are important, but proximity to a major city, shops and doctors are also crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations for Germans in December).
The third group is businessmen who invest with the aim of increasing value in the medium to long term.
The capital city is also experiencing a steady increase in the price of real estate, due to the ever-increasing demand.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest property prices in the EU, it has seen a 21% increase in prices over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian six per cent
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is a heated debate going on between the industrialized and developing countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but is willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared with 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the developed countries are prepared to provide both financial and technological support to the developing countries in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on aid to developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol's adaptation fund is to be managed by a Council of 16, presumably under the auspices of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in Piace et Profit.
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to remain at the forefront of global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels), whether or not the "Post-2012 Agreement" is achieved, and that the Union would even be ready to commit to a 30% reduction if other major industrial countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to meet their commitments in a responsible and efficient manner.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the countries that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU, with its then 15 Member States, had already committed to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release from the Ministry of Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012 - in which case the reduction plans set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the international climate change scientific committee of the UN, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in its recent report.
This would delay emissions reductions and inevitably increase the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C, with consequences that scientists say are extremely serious and irreparable.
British Army is advertising on YouTube
British Army units have posted footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to the video portal to boost its popularity.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The footage, taken with miniature cameras mounted on helmets, is checked at Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where it is uploaded to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, and their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The UK Ministry of Defence registered under 'defenceheadquarters' in spring 2007 to publish videos of Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the UK Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Keeping Force (MNFI) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and the Department of Defense says the posts also serve to inform the public about the real goals of foreign missions.
Such published propaganda is almost free compared to traditional television advertisements, said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the legitimacy of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans are advertising with games
The army also has to fight against amateur film, which, alongside carefully edited, censored footage, also makes it to the net - such as those showing the deaths of soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the casualties are the main topic, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Incidentally, many videos of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genre" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, with the free-to-download shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's shoes in a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogashes in the ministries
The Minister for Labour, Mónika Lamperth, is not being too presumptuous: instead of a Christmas party, she is organising a working conference where her staff can finish 2007 with coffee and a chat.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas spirit with tombolas or punches in the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffets - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The largest Christmas party of any ministry will be held at the Defense Center this year, but the Ministry staff is not expected to attend.
The "Orphans' Christmas Party" is a celebration of children being given away by fallen soldiers, the "Mission Party" is a celebration of family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department is providing about 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are the most successful.
The Ministry of Economy's 4.32 million Forint Christmas party will be held at the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
The focus of the festivities will be on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4,7 million forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the State Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The room rate was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) with EU funds.
The building of the Vígszínház (Víngus Playhouse) was rented for the celebration.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information as we have not reached the relevant authorities.
What's with the suit?
The ILO building was open not only to NFU guests but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
About 500 people came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, followed by live music and dancing after the dinner.
At the request of [origo], it was reported that there was no dress or suit requirement at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health is holding the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 forints.
The Minister for Labour, Mónika Lamperth, is officially inviting her staff not to a Christmas party, but to the annual awards conference.
If you expect about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - will be served only with coffee and talks, the celebration will cost 350,000 forints.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai, and his colleagues will simply be in the Ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, which is expected to bring 436 staff.
The expenditure was set at 2,500 forints per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-offs.
Since the beginning of János Veres's term in office, the PM's staff have celebrated in this way every year.
But there will be no real party atmosphere - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration has been scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture is inviting you to a New Year's reception on January 20th, the Ministry's Christmas party is missing this time.
The 100 guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information provided by the department, the expenses are measured at 1,000 forints per guest.
The press department reports that it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions held each year traditionally begin with a short address by the minister and sound with restrained cheering.
As the relevant press outlets report on request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Education.
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment was unable to provide information on the cost of the Christmas celebration.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which will be held at the Museum of Arts and Crafts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions are forming their coordinating committee for the indefinite strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday a protest rally is held, and on Monday - the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the lay-off begins.
The strike is expected to cause significant traffic disruption, as rail traffic will be almost completely halted and Budapest's public transport companies (BKVs) will also be on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up to coordinate the actions on Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday and from Monday all organisations that have joined the strike will stop working indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law, was not defined.
If the National Council does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike action.
If the law is passed, however, the strike committees meet to discuss the next steps.
The agenda of the National Council on Monday makes it even conceivable that it will not come to a vote on the Health Insurance Act until late in the evening or even at midnight.
The strike, which will begin on Monday, will lead to significant traffic disruptions: railway workers will stop their work indefinitely, most public transport will be shut down in the morning and more than half of Volán's companies will be shut down.
At the same time, there will be one-way roadblocks in many places.
The call for strike action has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil society organisations - the list of participants is updated on the League's website.
Some organisations have announced indefinite strikes, others are planning temporary layoffs.
As of Thursday afternoon, no agreement had been reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ on adequate services, although more and more people are travelling by train around Christmas.
According to reports, the BKVs are on strike from the start of the day until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA Electricity and Heating Unions are on strike for four hours, and the teachers' union, for example the Democratic Teachers' Union, have called for 2- and 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is striking at different times in alternation throughout the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraw the draft reform of the health insurance system and submit a new concept for the social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
The third requirement is that eligible occupational groups should be able to access the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which is part of the Trade Union League, has not accepted the sub-line offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to Political Capital's Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was established in August with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, have increased the risk to Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's 'risk warning report' states, among other things, that the greatest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is the 'exacerbation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term'.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is presumably aimed at provoking such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
This is reportedly seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "Public figures have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now based their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian antagonism".
It is suspected that this would aggravate the problem, prevent reasonable dialogue, favour extremism, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, have "significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We recall that since the autumn of 2006 the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been on the rise, so that since the summer of 2007 several organisations called the "National Self-Defence Association" have been established.
"The common feature of these groups is that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly boasting of preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (disaster protection, national defence, law enforcement), citing the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state itself", it said.
And further: all this is done according to the method which tries to disguise various political aspirations based on the political and party obsession of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil nature and the form of the association is therefore not merely a means of avoiding legal obstacles which might arise in the course of registration with the courts - it is also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard also constitute a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighboring countries, so some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain neighboring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policies.
All this has implications for the political stability of the region".
The research institute considers that the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, and that the political risk to the region as a whole has increased.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard are reportedly similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the creation of the Bulgarian Guard was the mass riots of Roma in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as an occasion for the creation of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization was "national protection".
In their view, a veritable "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, according to Political Capital.
The initiative would have sparked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they are setting up their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the risk warning report by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and if risk changing trends are detected, the public would be informed, as in the case of the issuance of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, public holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of rearranging working days around public holidays has become established, but we will have fewer such days next year.
The European Union and the United States also have a different definition of a holiday.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
The days off are usually church holidays or are associated with important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year's Day: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are non-working days - the latter just so that New Year's Eve celebrants can rest.
We have a total of fourteen holidays throughout the year.
The state holidays are 15 March, which commemorates the 1848 Revolution, and 23 October, the anniversary of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20th, the founding of the State is celebrated, on May 1st, work is celebrated, on November 1st and 2nd we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each - Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday postponement" has proved effective in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
The date on which this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finally worked out has been determined for many years by the Minister of Labour in a regulation of his own.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, to civil servants and civil servants alike.
Only firms and establishments where the business is carried on without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays, are excluded.
The work schedule is now only a little confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December onwards, life in this country is formally at a standstill, as most people take the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve in the same time, or the holidays set aside for that purpose.
Next year, more holidays will fall in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be less reordering of working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the workday so that people can stay home for four days straight.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, can be a day of rest.
The second change is linked to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, the work will have to be carried out in advance on Friday 24 October.
The end of the year will be marked by holidays, however, since everything will be in place from 24 December, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six Scarecrow Things to Do to Anger Coworkers
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive -- harmless lies we never notice: they bring color into everyday work.
The question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or whether you better face the challenge and consciously try to avoid these misunderstood, irritating situations.
I'll give you some tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called", says a colleague.
That it's a missed meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make amends, perhaps by calling the marketing department and remorsefully admitting that you forgot to forward the message (which is the less common method).
Most of the time, an apology is the answer.
Before embarrassing excuses are made, consider what might cause your colleagues to feel truly uncomfortable and try to avoid such situations.
Borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, an office supplies, or a phone, and it's not there.
Yesterday the tape recorder was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the presumed lost pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
You should not borrow anything from your colleagues without asking, for they are rightly upset when they find out that something has gone missing.
So don't put envelopes or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it might hit you, and there's nothing left if you need it urgently.
Talking about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a garbage that has already been put out into the world.
Who did what to who?
Where and why?
Information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues should not be tied to everyone's nose if possible!
And when someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to keep silent like a grave rather than to point out the absent one, even if others know about the colleague's problems.
You're sick for no reason?
If you call the office to report sick, citing a headache, because you are feeling unwell or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: Your own work, unnecessary tasks, projects with fixed deadlines must now be done by your colleagues instead of by yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you know the day before that you will not be able to make it to the office the next day, or that something might happen that will require you to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither your colleagues nor your boss will be confronted with the unexpected absence.
The whole thing, the geeks, the phone calls.
You're busy with your work, but suddenly you're interrupted by the loud giggling of your colleagues?
Unintentionally overheard a phone call you shouldn't have heard?
You should not annoy your colleagues with humming, singing, loud conversations (running over their heads), trampling, constant insults, or nagging.
All of this can be very disruptive, even if they are not really engaged in one task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other guy's fault?
If a project is not finished on time, if you have forgotten to send an important letter or important message, you should not blame others for your own forgetfulness!
If possible, avoid the chaos of the office or the noise of your colleagues.
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected by them!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or make up for what was missed is all too appropriate.
In the office - a homelike feeling?
Training pants and slippers: Comfortable at home, but not at the office!
Even if the workplace actually permits it, you should not dress so lightly!
Don't be too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the point of dressing appropriately in the office - if desired, even pretty and elegant!
I am not sure how to explain this to you.
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
The radio is playing a strange tune: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The tempo changes, the bass is added to the sounds, and the real jewel is a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which is playing on mr2.
The local music scene hasn't exactly spoiled us with quality electropop for a long time.
But now you can see the traffic jam differently when you listen to Zagar's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even when garage rock with its guitar quirks is back, the local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, playing in the band Yonderboi himself, before - perhaps because an inn can't stand two pipes - starting his own path.
However, he only made his breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
The first is the "Season" by Ferenc Török.
The band, which had initially performed in smaller clubs, only became known to a wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, for almost the only trendsetter marketable in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one cared whether they liked to wear that brand.
The band responded as they should, with a new, even better album.
The new album, entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", may open up new paths for them, but the title itself expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term originated when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying accents would be fine, but the more loud guitar, the influences of rock 'n' roll, are noticeable - in keeping with the spirit of the times and the trends - in addition to the ethereal nature of the music.
These songs were used by the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", to present himself at the premiere at the Millenáris.
One song from the album has even become a radio hit - Mr2 Petőfi, who has been broadcasting pop music from early to late, has successively put the earworm on the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So, you all right?
The hvg.hu has asked about Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" does not mean much to me.
I think there are two classes of pop music, and that's not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be soft and insignificant, but it can also be produced only for the sake of sales, which makes it commercial music.
Even a good pop number can be made from an honest motive.
The receptivity of the listener also works according to this principle, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
For example, in foreign countries, especially in the West, pop music has a larger tradition.
It's not just teenagers and twins who go to concerts, it's the older audience.
They're much more attentive to the trends in pop music that are happening around them, because they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B.Z.: Of course, it's a good feeling to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we never wrote for the market.
We don't make music to serve a purpose, we make it for a reason.
The role of the audience is most often felt in concerts, where there is already an interaction, but this again only in the intangible changes of the moment.
But I've noticed that if you're trying to please everyone, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's on the road as a soloist and he's built his career more in the West.
Z.S.: We don't really go his way, except that they keep trying to interpret it into our music.
We see ourselves more as team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us have left his band and have taken a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" is number one.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
We had no plans to write a hit song that would be the driving force behind the album.
There's more to this song.
It was intended as the end of the album, where we wanted to break down the sound orgy and the more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them, what was the guiding principle?
The idea was to make a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir came into being - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls help design it?
For example, the song had been in the instrumental version for a while, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this song "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the tune that night, and later they taught the girls.
It all came about almost instantly and frighteningly spontaneously.
I remember being pretty electrified back then, but it was already needed by the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have gotten this strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, they sing perfectly together and are no louder than the music, so their singing is not just accompanied by the music.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Z. The fact that they were standing in the back was purely a technical problem.
We didn't want to give them solo roles, though.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little bit, forgetting who came from where and where is going, just allowing those particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I want others to feel the same euphoric state that we felt when the song was written.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
For example, in the case of musical creation, there was no such thing as a "no" - there were more difficult tasks in the mixing process.
Like in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play a concert piano, or in "Rock 'n' Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work anymore, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
E.g.: That changes with the concerts and now that I've "released" the album.
Right now it's "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth", and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
A groundless fraud
This is what Jerome Kerviel, the owner of the Komerční banka, calls his former employee.
He cost her almost five billion euros.
It seems more likely that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same as his colleagues, and certainly not incapable.
Unlike all the big banks, he was able to spot the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's a bit of a weak psychic", said his superiors, who reported him to the police.
But as Kervil's statements, published in French media such as the daily Le Monde, show, he was a man who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros from his business at the end of last year.
The crisis is not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed to make half a billion euros just from the American crisis.
He had foreseen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were early reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, which are given to low-income customers or those who have had problems with repayment in the past, were going to run into trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel did not believe that and was right.
By the end of the year, he had increased his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made my first half a billion dollars, I didn't know how to explain it", Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn't keep anything to himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits to falsifying documents to avoid being caught.
He even managed to trick his bosses into buying his business, even though the Eurex stock exchange was beginning to take an interest in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly up?
I don't think so, though.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank".
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant to a realtor, and in 2005, he became a freelance realtor with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never make as much as others.
"Ever since my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development", Kerviel told the investigating officers.
But soon after his arrival, the first big success came.
He made a lot of money with the Alliance's shares, betting half a billion euros on the loss of the title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you're making a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball", he told the policeman.
But the bosses were supposed to know about everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I made money, people closed their eyes".
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big blow came.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he tried to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that they had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He was on vacation, and he got suspicious.
"I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn't take a holiday is one who doesn't want to be looked at", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday a total of nine development programmes which will enable the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion kroner) in the next few years.
This is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion kroner come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The bulk of the money, about 150 billion, will go to transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money is being increased in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be worth 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and firms raise funds for innovative ventures.
The aim is to raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for research into the business world, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful of the new EU countries in acquiring EU funds.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20-year sentence for former president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the 20-year sentence of former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hazienda in the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997-2002) of this Central American state will be back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials whether Alemán is allowed to serve his sentence at home or if he has to go to prison.
A court found four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
The budget is
Yes, it is done.
The budget is approved.
What is so special about this budget?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and adopted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The current year's proposal was approved with the support of the Social Democrats (CSSD) because it had been submitted by Minister Sobotka (from this party), and the CSSD could not therefore afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives passed this traditionally unheeded, yet highly significant law in complete silence.
That is a paradox.
All government begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is obscured by the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciated topic for the media, and therefore they devote more attention to it.
A dispute between politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The public budgets suffered from three weaknesses under the previous Social Democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure which is legally compulsory, not only for pensions but also for social expenditure, which the "tacit" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit policy as a consequence of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and to a certain extent controlled.
The real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax, levy and bank credit, used other sources of investment, often by spending debt bonds, which over-indebted their city halls.
In recent years they have managed to pay off this debt by selling off shares in the energy and other supply networks which they had received from the State in the course of privatisation.
Now that spring is dry.
As far as we can tell, we're going to stick to official and verifiable facts.
The Commission has also been involved in the development of the European Union's external relations, and the European Union has been involved in the development of the European Union's external relations.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put their public finances in order.
Instead, these governments were adding more debt to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more prudently than our Republic.
This is a great disgrace, which is mainly due to the previous governments.
We are among the countries least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community.
Even if it has been possible to eliminate some of the nonsensical populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that unless the retirement age is moved forward and pension reform is implemented in the near future, then practically all politics in this country will end, and whoever is in power will be left with nothing but a mere administrator.
It is a bit of an exaggeration to say that then the ruling politicians will become civil servants, who will mechanically distribute most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
The budget of this year cannot therefore be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner forecast for 2008 would be completely redundant if previous governments had not spent as much as they could over the last ten years.
If we do not want the ruling politicians to become mere administrative officials, we must be patient and allow this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to collect in taxes and fees, to rest in preparing further reform legislation.
Only these will allow the progressive introduction of a balanced budget.
The following is a list of the names of the Member States:
Banks to cope with crisis
The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
This will bring over 100 billion dollars to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction off interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another $24 billion to make it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that national central banks have agreed to take such a coordinated approach to defending against or mitigating the effects of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest problems facing the economy, namely the growing shortage of free capital that banks can lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group in a report for his clients.
"Coordinated central bank action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost some $60 billion on nonperforming loans, mainly in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions to be lost.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what was to come when they decided to do this", said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad", he continued.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing bonds, credit will also become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and push the American economy into a recession, potentially affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for lending money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money to each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as further lowering interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is contributing to the heating up of the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the collapse of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be hurting developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN's coming-to-end international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he argued that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
Klaus said that not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mix of government and non-governmental representatives, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality is unacceptable.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a firework, which is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed at the launch of his book that the subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book was published in German translation, because "I often encounter caricatures of my views".
So now interested persons could read his attitude without distortion.
Klaus reminded him that he was not a climatologist, but that he thought he had enough qualifications to write such a book.
He was an academic, capable of understanding and evaluating technical papers, experienced in statistics and an economist.
The main thesis of the book was that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he considers it a dangerous restriction on freedom.
When asked by those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not consider the relationship between effort and yield".
Klaus had spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driving licence
600,000 drivers missed the deadline for changing their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for a change so that the authorities can issue a new driver's license by the end of the year.
But the ministry does not fear that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid driving license.
According to the authorities, the main reason for not changing their license is that they do not want to drive anymore.
While small towns are reporting a sharp decline in interest in driving license exchange, the capital's offices are being flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange has grown this week.
The city administration handles around 2000 customers a day.
You have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, some 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
It takes 20 days to get a new driver's license.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to make the required change by the end of the year and start without a valid driving licence will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
The police may also issue a warning in the event of a violation.
In the event of a violation, the fine can be increased to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the municipality may also impose a fine on those who do not drive at all.
He could, it was said, be fined up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the authorities to be lenient and to impose a fine of no more than 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand-krone fine.
The driving licence is a document where everyone can decide whether or not to have it.
It is not an identity card that everyone should have, and a valid one.
People who don't want to drive should turn in their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take it to the appropriate municipal office or to send it there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
But gradually, drivers are having to change other types of driving licenses.
People with driver's licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three years to change.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will end in December 2013.
Hanzelka said that the issue is about 2.6 million additional driver's licenses.
Court cuts sentences for detectives who were in league with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of having been involved with David Berdych's gang, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague High Court, which reduced their sentence by one or two years.
The original sentence for detectives working for the Office for the Fight against Organised Crime was 14 or 12 years.
There is no appeal against today's verdict, only review by the Supreme Court.
Mr Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but he is first to be tried at first instance.
However, in other trials he had already received sentences totalling 16 years.
He can't be convicted of anything more.
A district court in January found 19 people guilty, mainly for involvement in robberies, and the High Court today heard the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants denied the charge from the start, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police officers in consultation with Berdych criminals, among others, passed on information from police sources, covered up various robberies and helped gang members to evade prosecution.
The gang gave Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the loot in exchange.
The charges relate to crimes committed by the gangs between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also presumption of office and illegal possession of arms.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser-guided telescope, and a machine gun.
The gang has, according to the indictment, enriched itself by its robberies of many millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this case, Berdych and a number of others were found guilty by the courts of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's entourage have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet reached court.
The main proceedings have so far been avoided by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns from the hospital in Třebíč plus court costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for each father and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's lawyer, Ondřej Dostál, therefore strongly disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high", Dostál said after today's hearing.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion which produced the counter-proposal.
We'll see if it's worth mentioning.
We insist, however, that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all together,' said Dostál.
The amount should be between SEK 100000 and SEK 200000 for each of the four parents.
At first, the family in Jablonow wanted a million kroner for every month that they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used an expert opinion prepared for it by the Motol University Hospital in Prague as a basis for its compensation negotiations.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the children's parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying intensity and depth.
The men endured the stress situation better, even though they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
Women, on the other hand, are less able to cope with the aftermath of the trauma they have experienced, as well as with what is happening now, Veleba summarized.
Veronika and Nikola switched nurses at the maternity clinic in Třebíč on December 9 last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablonow.
The district governor of Vysočina (Bohemian-Moroccan Highlands) gave each family 100,000 crowns at the end of October to compensate for expenses incurred by the error of the district hospital in Třebíč.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured against liability.
In case of doubt, they must have recourse to a reserve fund, and only in exceptional cases can they request assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low amounts of damages to the victims, the amounts being determined by tables and ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions.
Polívka lost his kingdom Wallachia
Bolekívka lost the dispute over the trademark "Kingdom of Wallachia".
According to the judge at the Ostrava District Court, although he was the first to use the term "King of Wallachia", the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor over many years.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
His lawyer says that's probably not the end of the matter, and his client is likely to appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team wanting to parasitize Bolek Polívka's popularity", said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
Everyone thought of this actor and comedian when they heard the words "Wallachian Kingdom".
The same opinion is shared by Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
The Commission is also working on a new strategy for the future.
He says the reason is a money fight.
"After years, they have realized that the project is successful and that they could have something of it.
They want to parasitically profit from our work", he continued.
Profitable business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "King of Wallachia" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that was not the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From an initially fun action, a business and entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachische Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to have his name and signature used in passports and even offered his owners discounts on visits to his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" program for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian Kingdom", the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had devoted themselves intensely to it.
The cooperation of the now-disputed parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation of Polívka in Vsetín.
But since then, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to mount, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I. elected until St. Nimmerleins Day".
The leadership role was then assumed by Harabis' suggestion of Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
The contest for the throne and half a princess, prepared by Harabiš, could bring clarity to the dispute.
A new king was to come.
He didn't want to give out details or a date.
"We are not in a hurry.
It was supposed to be like the royal parade in Wallachia.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka can also join in,' Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: the benefits are fading
To tell you the truth, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and even the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The van called SW is a bit further, and I just have to change my mind.
For example, when I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, I complained about the lack of headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints are no longer there, because the body of the van is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Keep moving
I'll just go over the interior, so I don't have to repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty successful design, where I'm just having a problem with the awkward middle tunnel.
I'd appreciate a little more design where the car would otherwise make such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the days when we might complain about too short seats or headrests are over.
The page content has also improved considerably compared to 206.
As regards the space, the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork can be felt here too.
The van also eliminates the aforementioned lack of headroom.
Suitcases in the trunk.
The main thing about this car is the cargo hold.
I must say that it is very good for loading and space-saving (also because of the folding back window).
The cavities are equipped with buckles, which are an ideal compromise.
They are non-interfering, easily detachable, and can hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
The table in the basic equipment shows that it is 428 litres, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison with the best-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is clearly behind by 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when inviting a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positive, I must mention the very flat loading bay after folding the rear seats or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and a power output of 88 kWp.
And frankly, this is what a 1600cc engine that powers a family hatchback should look like.
It's quiet, low-power, and it's good for a ride.
When I compare him to his Škoda counterpart, who sometimes seems to have his exhaust covered with a rag, I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still to be announced.
With our engine, it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car once again beats with 80000 crowns in addition to Buche.
But we had copper-fairy bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, electric window lifts in the back and and...
The car costs a mere 531900 kroner.
That's a lot, but if you add up the extra equipment of a Fabia, you'll end up with a very similar amount.
So the only choice left is which brand you want to choose.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not successful
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which is causing local people to fear the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even report cases of increasing violence between immigrant and native children.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the case of North Kent, where clashes between local and Slovak immigrants are increasing.
Fighting, bullying and rioting among students have spread to the relationship between parents.
The situation has already developed to the point where the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The defendant argued that the boy had insulted her with racist slurs.
The police also had to intervene after an attack on two underage girls by a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and had thrown stones at him.
"As we were walking home, a boy climbed up a bush hut and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then uncovered his butt", described another unpleasant incident by a mother of a Slovak student in The Times newspaper.
Complaints come from both sides.
One local even described the quarrel with Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases show that the atmosphere between natives and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are reported to have come here in search of work.
Some 30 000 Slovak pupils are attending British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it will come true if you just choose the right one.
Gold and white beaches, high waves or a sea as calm as a pond.
Palm and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you will find plenty of it.
But there is only one island where you can find much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
In the days of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by the human eye.
Havana once became a storehouse or transit warehouse for the treasures the Spanish had stolen in the Americas and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the American mafia bosses, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during Prohibition) was seen as welcome and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
I mean, you know, Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
In Havana, high-rise buildings were growing, and cars were driving along the wide boulevards, which were among the iconic symbols of the 1950's.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, celebrities from the entertainment industry and politicians from all over America signed their names.
What about today?
You can also sign your name on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
The bar at the Hotel Nacional will mix cocktails for you.
And the iconic cars of the 1950's still drive around Havana today, because the once-imported shiguli and fiat cars have long since disintegrated in the salty and moist air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, has been severely degraded, nowhere in the surrounding area do you find so many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned up, like Trinidad.
The green light was given to this development, in view of the fact that tourism brings much needed money.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marotte, unique in the world and especially attractive to railway lovers.
Sugar pipes from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow-gauge railways to the sugar mills.
Their fleet has not been renovated for decades, and so you see neat and fully functioning locomotives whose counterparts are already in the museum elsewhere.
Destinations of the excursion
The most important places are not left out by the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana anymore.
It should be noted that the aforementioned Hemingway estate houses a museum that should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, their cavities accumulating fertile soil, which even weathered rocky areas are covered with dense bushes.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it when you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
It may also be interesting to note that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
The
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
She gained fame and wealth through the slave trade and sugar trade.
The wealth was embodied in the ornate beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has changed little in the last four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that there was no road connecting the area to the rest of the country until the 1950's.
This isolation helped keep it from being noticed.
Nothing was built there, but neither was anything torn down, and everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon to visit Trinidad, it is worthwhile to visit interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factories".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark, and where the music does not cease until the morning.
Other
This little town in the far east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way to get there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo to the island must overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape barely touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included on UNESCO's World Heritage List because of its unspoiled nature.
The best chocolate is made there, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in fact, it was made about a hundred years after Columbus' voyages), and from the hill where the former castle, now the Hotel El Castillo, stands, several table mountains are visible, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
You could write many pages about coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, an African religion practiced by the descendants of slaves.
But, as they say, better to see for yourself.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
The United States believes that the lack of troops and equipment is affecting the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go as planned, as agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the representatives of the countries which have deployed troops in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing plans for further coordination among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called for more NATO activity, Britain has made it a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and to step up development aid.
"There is progress in Afghanistan, but military force can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the residents to start their own economic and security development", British Defence Secretary Des Browne tells the BBC.
90%
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the US military.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
The United States, however, says that the Allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We're going to have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next period and how we can achieve them", Gates said.
The European Union is a great example of a democratic Europe.
"I am not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The countries involved have also been arguing in recent months about whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany has been criticized for being passive.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the demands of combat for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan non-insurgents unmasked: Germans playing games while our boys fight", the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild newspaper counterattacked and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Public debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to take on 159.2 billion Konas of debt this year.
However, in early December, thanks to the improved development of the state budget policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they thus rose by 40.2 billion.
However, since June, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the public debt at the beginning of October.
Each Czech is owed 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state has borrowed more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we may not cross the one trillion kroner mark until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns", David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, similarly observes: "We could exceed one trillion by the end of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next household we don't know yet.
If the political situation shows signs of changing and politicians are willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change", he remarked.
Debt is growing
The public debt stems from the state government's debts and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct borrowing or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The national public debt has risen this year to 719,4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the State has meanwhile increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable public debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Total debt rose by 13 percent year-on-year from the first to the third quarter, which is a lot considering how well the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the growth is mainly in bonds, where the growth is 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes", Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of the public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to borrow 159,2 billion crowns for this year.
However, in early December, thanks to the improved development of the state budget policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
The Commission also proposed a maximum of SEK 13.3 billion for the consolidation agency, a reserve of SEK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of SEK 43 billion of government bonds and a loan facility of SEK 1.8 billion for the European Investment Bank.
For naming a teddy bear, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who was charged with insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced to 15 days in prison and deportation by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old schoolchildren to name a teddy bear Muhammad, even though any depiction of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be flogged.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code with insulting Islam.
In fact, the matter began in September when the teacher asked her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
"The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", reports school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class, with the picture of the bear on it and the caption "My name is Mohammed".
The bear himself did not wear a shield with that name, but the problem is quite simple, that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and she would never have done anything that would have brought her too close to a religious belief, "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", which he considered to be an "innocent mistake".
This is an opinion shared by many of the teacher's students, who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "a person who never talks about religion in class".
It should be noted that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common middle name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can it be given to a toy, for example?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
The last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday failed to reach agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo concluded a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversies over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status", European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
The European Union and the United States have agreed to a new round of talks on the Middle East peace process, which will be held in Brussels on 1 January.
'No violence is expected in the near future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time', he added, indicating that there are clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which unites the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was given a new mediation mandate by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insisted on continuing the negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia has been and remains a champion of a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution", said Botsane-Kharchenko.
The unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration, the only solution for the future is for Kosovo to become independent under EU supervision.
Pristina is prepared to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
'Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached', said the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where the 'last-chance negotiations' have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future premier of the province, shared his regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan proposed by Belgrade 'belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations'.
The Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence for the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly concerned about a "domino effect" in a region which has been so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
'For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible', he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken solely and exclusively in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
'Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia', declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
'These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end up the way they started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied to journalists that "the parliament of Kosovo will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population will be made "in agreement" with Western countries.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference he chaired in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything possible to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must stop its colonization efforts, Bush said, reminding both sides of their commitments to the "roadmap" for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority ultimately aim to reach a peace agreement that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term covers the three major issues which are at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the 1948 conflict, which is now the State of Israel.
After the US president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be 'comprehensive and thorough' and provide a settlement on all points, listing 'Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water and security, among others'.
When Olmert took the floor, he pledged that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted "directly and without interruption" and that he would work to ensure that they could be concluded before the end of 2008.
Bush has set a deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two states", one Palestinian and one Israeli, existing side by side, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it received assurances from Bush in this regard before deciding to attend the conference.
The Arab countries, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, have initiated a plan adopted by all the Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly as it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects', said the Saudi prince in an interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
The prosecutor believes that the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are at odds.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Disciplinary Bureau of the Police (IGPN), a police car drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
"He was not on duty but was on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h without a blue light", a police spokesman said.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, 'not registered, therefore not approved for public use' (see below), was driven by two teenagers without helmets and came into contact 'at very high speed'.
"It hit the left side of the police car after it had ignored its right-hand drive", a police officer said.
The alcohol control carried out on the vehicle passengers was very negative.
The condition of the car (squashed wing, split windscreen, torn bumper) indicates the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary manslaughter and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main investigation team for public security in Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excluded the police from investigating the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident who were heard on Sunday evening confirmed "the police's version, namely that this small bicycle came relatively quickly to her left side".
Yesterday, some sort of grooves, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the floor, showed that the two vehicles had been stuck together until the police were able to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly spread in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, without helping the two young men.
Although the IGPN remains cautious, it would also rule out 'any serious error' in this case.
According to one police source, "this is a difficult aspect of the investigation that requires further investigation and very careful handling".
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
"We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her", says this Witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely distraught cop limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the teenagers, the fourth one was on the phone.
In view of the rapidly building tension surrounding the incident and, apparently, the certainty of those present about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in by their colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue workers arrived "about twenty minutes after the police had left".
They also used cardiac massages, but to no avail.
"I will not allow it to be said that the police did not help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police put down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to eyewitness accounts, in the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas shells fired by the police.
They then threw stones at the policemen, injuring them.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily detained.
Similar scenarios have been reported in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers have attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court's attorney's office have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers' movement received support on Monday from the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the public to send flowers to the judges who voted against the emergency and garbage to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
"Musharraf's promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
He was asked to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from office and replaced.
"All that we are advocating is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's decisions", the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to relinquish command of the army and become a civilian president "has not been valid" since the declaration of the state of emergency, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by November 15, the date his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government also denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the new law that allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is unplanned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the institute, which notes that the percentage of female users of the pill between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless allowed for better 'control of fertility'.
At any rate, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
In fact, one in five couples calculate the monthly birth rate, and if possible, in the spring, the time of year when it seems most convenient to have a baby.
Spectacular repairs at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members of the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a faulty solar array that is essential to the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring launch that has set several records for its duration, the distance of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools "crafted" by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday when astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to accommodate European and Japanese science laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to power them.
The second task of the crew was to install a 17.5 ton solar module already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After relocating it, the crew began restructuring the module's solar panels, which have a span of 76 meters.
And what happened was that one of the collectors, which you can make out like an accordion, was damaged by a pinched wire about a meter long.
The restructuring was stopped to avoid further damage to the collector.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a check-in and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the end of the 30-meter-long remote arm of the shuttle that the station was attached to to perform the repair.
He's one of the best space walkers at NASA.
Large, resilient, highly skilled, with a well-developed torso and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was chosen to "operate" on the "injured" solar panel.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rails on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained close to the lock, and, from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock from hitting the solar panels, which generate several hundred volts, had been conceived and "crafted" by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the collector to be fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before returning to the space shuttle Discovery today, with seven astronauts expected to begin their return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
EADS securities are sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defence group announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to offset the A400M deficit, EADS shares are currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007 in view of the backlogs caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which is delaying the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to 'between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion for Airbus', announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
The group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month lag.
As a reminder, EADS's business performance declined by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large A380 aircraft carrier.
The group had originally planned to deliver the first A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
The counting of the ballots on Sunday will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very tight election campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, broadcast on public broadcasts, which has already been recorded but whose contents are kept secret.
He is doing so in his capacity as the leading candidate for the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, which is set to win a landslide victory.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything slip when he received the foreign ambassadors, and he was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
'We know the price of true democracy and we hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud', he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they're wrong.
She is denouncing an election campaign tainted by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there had never been "such dirty elections, not even in Yeltsin's time".
After the crackdown on the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have retained the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus"
After these uncertain parliamentary elections, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008, with candidates having until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, who will choose the government and the president?
Whatever happens in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the current government will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have retained the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their fate", says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes even further back: Civil society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has re-established the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was followed not by terror but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "freely renouncing" the personal responsibility they had briefly assumed after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why do you think so?"
This phenomenon affects all strata of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral rolls of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
The conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why think so much?
Those in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A painful memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now open to the public.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have so far been unable to be accessed except for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individual and named, i.e. upon request of a former victim or his relatives.
The 11 countries responsible for its administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to make it available to researchers and historians.
The opening of the procedure is effective since yesterday, following the completion of the ratification process of this Decision.
The Commission
The historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct research, "especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health of forced labourers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The lists of concentration camp inmates or the Gestapo warrants for their arrest were compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labor and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent staff in Bad Arolsen are still processing tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, there is a part of the scientific community that shows only limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents", declared Professor Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
The current volume of trade between India and Europe is already 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said the EU and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its number one foreign investor, but according to the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
'A free trade pact will give the two economies a huge boost' and 'India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans', confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products by India, the European Commissioner said.The Asian and European giants trade '€47 billion worth of goods' and '€10 billion worth of services' annually, said Danièle Smadja, President of the European Commission Delegation in New Delhi, this week, and regretted that the trade between the two countries had not 'fullled its potential'.The EU and India will meet for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi on Friday, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso in attendance.

The Bank of England is aware of the concern and is offering £10 billion for five weeks.
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about curbing the ongoing worries about credit conditions, announcing a five-week offer of £10 billion at a base rate of 5.75%, an unusual duration.
"To alleviate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly tough at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about how to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase, which starts on 6 December, in the form of a five-week open market operation", it said in a statement.
The Bank further explains that in this way 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation at 12.15 GMT on 6 December, at the rate of land tax, and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually takes place for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is "ready to take further steps to maintain the" day-to-day "interest rates" of interbank lending at their base rate.
The interbank rate, which varies from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been pegged at 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts put into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penalty payments which have prevented banks from using them.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums circulated by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with more discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was drawn up in the context of a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), listed some 10 measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, the majority of which were 50% on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP floating rate, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After the UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was dissolved after the main debate, which occasionally led to violent exchanges of words between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the television talk by Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The Leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present all its proposals as an amendment to the draft law on the adjustment of the finances which had been examined by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America", Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 is hosting the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is expected to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the running of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational functions of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the 'most inspiring event' he has ever been to, says that his company and Melvin Benn's are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
"We have chosen Philadelphia as our market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
We have been negotiating with the city and the Commission has been motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Luckily, we've been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we're making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary location that will ultimately benefit the people".
C3 Presents revived the 2005 Lollapalooza festival in Grand Park Chicago after it made its mark in the festival world in 2002 along with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenues in 2007 respectively.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more of an urban green space", says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in some way, to give the impression of a rural festival in the European way and an urban festival in the American way".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is happy to take on the burden of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that will hopefully have a long life".
Charlie Jones says the festival's capacity is "very large", equivalent to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing has been confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer a taste for rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of audiences", says Charlie Jones.
His partners at C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is meeting the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal when no one less than the Terminator is opposed.
These temptations are part of the delegate's duties.
A politically sensitive mandate because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that are considered to be the best", he says.
The run to the festivals.
However, for Denis Turcotte, the promotion of local cinema is the top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At every festival on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's going to be about introducing the Quebec films, evaluating them, and making sure that the producers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It's going to be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the Santa Monica poster and will be shown at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock market on the verge of a year-end rally?
With just under five weeks to go before the end of the year, investors are already scrubbing their hands in anticipation of the year-end rally.
However, experts cannot make any reliable forecasts.
Banif believes that "on a purely statistical basis, the month of December is usually associated with a positive market trend in the stock market.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make short-term forecasts based on statistics alone, especially when serious tensions are determining the current market situation.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong rise in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that "the stock market price is determined by the liquidity of the market and the market participants, who, due to the lack of secure equity funds, invest mainly in pension funds, which are strongly affected by the upward trend towards high-yielding assets.
As a result, they believe that the stock market will be more likely to be a lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, "mainly because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US Federal Reserve rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the risk of an increase in the inflation rate".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an impending market rally.
"The odds are not very good", the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4 % since its peak of 15 945,7 points on 8 November.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could end the year with almost 16 000 points, as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional allocation of funds to the pension fund, which takes place every year at this time.
However, the expert points out that this year things could be a little different, especially because of the end-of-year rally taking place in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the Constitution Day.
The analyst considered that the price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the current market assessments are almost technical, which could lead to 'a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US mortgage crisis, in the near future.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
The choice of values to push the Ibex to new highs is agreed upon by analysts.
Solana from Intermoney says that "this year it's the big values that are next".
The expert would say that the two major banks and some real estate companies would be among the value-gainers, "because the electricity sector will be too expensive at a given time".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by increases in the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
"The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit", the expert said.
As regards the increased consumption patterns during the Christmas period, the market will be dominated by periodic consumption in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only experienced two falling prices.
When the technology bubble burst in late 2003, it brought the stock market out of its crisis and also initiated the last real year-end rally to date.
This year, when the Ibex 35 was up 28.17 percentage points, December saw a rise of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth consecutive year of profitability (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and whether it will also show a year-end rally remains to be seen.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day, Monday through Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically developed regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to take the leap to extend the opening hours of its branches to 8.30pm on weekdays and from 10am to 8.30pm on Saturdays.
The BBVA group, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its branch opening hours, has not yet taken a final decision.
The Bank's negotiations with the unions seem to be aimed at an agreement whereby 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open on weekday afternoons, although not for customers.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative to adapt to business hours will depend on Popular Bank's experience.
And that is precisely what Popular is trying to do with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those shops which, owing to their location, are able to cater to the shopping-minded clientele of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new opening hours but rather changed opening hours.
The Bank will therefore restructure the premises of those branches already located in business areas, while adapting them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of opening hours is combined with a new layout of the shops, which is characterised by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The bank representative in charge, Ángel Rivera, assures that the restructuring would not require major investments but would involve an increase in staff, since a branch now needed eight or nine employees instead of six.
The branches, which will even have additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept in nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches on Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía streets have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently operates approximately 2,500 branches.
And 60 others, operating under the name of Mundocredit, which specialise in immigrants, also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
These PopularMax branches will not use the BBVA model, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
"We do not want to compete with our customers", explains Rivero.
They have reached a provisional agreement with Telefonica to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco is doubling its market value for the first time, overtaking its rival Antena 3.
"We made it".
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange, as the station he was leading had doubled its value compared with its rival, Antena 3.
However, one aspect dampened his joy: "That's exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses", he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they had not "gone too low".
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
This profit reduces its losses so far this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now stands at EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%) and Vocento with only a 13% stake.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has since January recorded a total loss of 40.5%, so that its market value of 2.193.46 million is half.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, is rising: in the case of Sogecable, to 3.571 million, in the case of Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be inferred from the fact that they are 'two similar companies', according to Vasile.
The question remains uncertain as to the extent to which we can actually act as a stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it profitable at the level of the customer.
Telecinco announced a week ago that it was planning to become the first television station to generate more than 1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, as assured by Guiseppe Tringali, managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965,4 million of the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1,6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734,4 million), while net revenues from the television business increased by only 0,7% (630,4 million).
The main factor in the comparatively better performance of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the high payout ratio that the company has been able to display up to now: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría distributed a 100% dividend.
Vasile assures that the ratio could still change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol, with Mediaset as parent company, although it is too early for an official announcement.
"We are committed to the official compromise of paying out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always given out substantially more.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already increased by purchasing 33% of Endemol's shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing some loss-making trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This is the result of the reduction in the projected growth rate, which will decrease from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
It also reduced Antena 3's profit forecast for 2008 by 4,5% and for 2009 by 7,5%.
Three options. What are you doing?
The first.
Ibersecurities: believes in its high effective yield and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2. the
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) is in a more favourable position than Antena 3 (hold) as a result of the 'multiple incentives' and the prospering market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends that expectations should be reset in both cases in view of the 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate)
Congress approves the MIFID directive, which went into effect on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary work, which ended today with the Senate's congressional resolution on the supplementary/amendment motions related to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law, with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of the members of the Congress and the Senate, who in their negotiations and votes had sought to establish the best possible arrangements to ensure the safety of investors and to regulate the individual activities of entrepreneurs in order to guarantee an overall efficient market.
In addition to modernising financial markets, MIFID, which redefines the rules governing investment services, aims to improve investor protection, increase the supervisory authority of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows financial advice to be provided to both specialist firms and natural or legal persons and also contributes to the creation of new financial services firms (ESIS), advisory firms which join investment and intermediary firms.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding to the regulated markets multilateral systems for the trading of securities and systems for the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law requires investment firms to disclose the main features of their business profile, the way they deal with and manage risks on the market and to register all projects carried out, thus facilitating the CNMV's control tasks.
The Congressional Economic Committee subsequently made further changes, with the decision that securities must now be considered as "complex" financial instruments because of their high degree of risk to the investor, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
The Commission has also taken advantage of the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of graduate economists, 30 years after the 1977 Regulation limiting the fields of work reserved for economists.
The Senate also defined new positions in the financial sector, such as that of an economic intermediary who operates on behalf of others, does not require authorisation from the CNMV and can offer his services for the commercialisation of products and the acquisition of clients to several investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union gives the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to provide a comparison of location and quality with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be made in advance by using the same approach as the harmonised index of consumer prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
The Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator, which was determined in advance, was only a reference value and therefore did not have to correspond to the final result to be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a "temporary development"; he also assured that the price index would remain at a "relatively high" level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress Building that 'even if the current figure is not good', Spain's inflation differential with the other members of the monetary union has remained 'more or less' the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were "fewer surprises" in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%", the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance said in reference to the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to generate over €42 billion in revenue over the next three years
Northern Rock's holdings have fallen by more than half since the bank requested a crisis-related emergency loan from the Bank of England in mid-September last year, and now stand at just £12 billion (€16.8 billion).
At that time, the bank's assets amounted to a record £25 billion, a sum which has fallen considerably in two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe, it will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would continue the group after the takeover under the Virgin Money brand, would need to bring in about a quarter of the income of the UK banks that will be made up of assets there over the next three years to acquire exactly the £18 billion that are still needed to reach their £30 billion target.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to invest £50 billion (approximately €70 million) in advertising and marketing campaigns each year to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, which has three other companies as its preferred bidder to get it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested on suspicion of participating in urban corruption
Spanish police have arrested the current mayor of Totano (Partido Popular) in the municipality of Murcia this morning on suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo, who replaced Juan Morales, a current deputy of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the Totana municipal council, last May, could be the original mastermind of the plot, according to information from Cadena SER radio.
Officials are continuing to search the municipal and city planning records and are not ruling out any further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the prime suspect in the urban corruption case uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
According to Cadena SER, the lawyer of the "popular" and therefore privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested as he left his client's residence on the basis of important incriminating documents allegedly related to the plot.
In addition, other sources report alleged contracts paid by Morales to a Galician construction company, which included the conclusion of an urban development contract, which decided to develop a 200-hectare site.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, if elected, in Congress.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, to take over the office of President of the Congress.
This is what José Blanco, the PSOE's secretary of organization, and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at the party headquarters today.
The Prime Minister believes that the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is "important to be able to count on the best" in politics and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, the Mancha politician would "apparently" run for the party's chairman of the congress in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections.
Bono will replace Manuel Martín as Congress president, who announced on 15 November that he would not run in the next general election, would end his career in public policy and would instead work in the university sector on climate change.
The former minister had to admit that the prime minister had been pushing him continuously to return to politics since he resigned two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of the Vice President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to withhold from the citizens who would take over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, calling it an "act of transparency".
If he were to take office, he hopes to turn the Chamber into a 'house of respect and not of insult or screaming', so that it 'will appear more and more like the citizens'.
"Unfortunately, from time to time it seems that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is the congress, and the president of the government has been interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and "his good work" and indicated that he did not want to appear to have already taken office, as his political opponents would call it "arrogance".
The Commission
Since the climate debate is subject to unrelenting criticism from both climate sceptics and those who prioritize social and political debate on climate change, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a 'new treaty with the planet'.
However, this proposal puts him in a position to question the actions or inaction of his government, which has contributed decisively to Spain's being the EU's least compliant country.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance, which sectors are responsible, and why his government, which proposed the 'Planetary Treaty', did not stop this development.
The Commission is also now obliged to present to the Spanish people the measures it intends to take to combat climate change without delay.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to adopt a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
More specifically, who will have to sacrifice and pay to save the planet.
However, there has been and will be no such explanation in the future.
Especially because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures that can be used to combat climate change are not popular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threaten the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol penny proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous from an electoral strategic point of view that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the European Union.
I am not going to go into detail here, but I am going to go into detail here.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise campaign-ready politician does not have to speak, accuse, or demand, but instead pursues the demanding task of decorating the meetings and enthusiastically entertaining others with his gentleness and goodness.
This can only be done if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not presume that the bicycle will be the only means of transport in the future or that we are only allowed to refresh ourselves with a spare.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana for alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of Totana, a town in Murcia, the "popular" politician José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur on suspicion of urban planning violations, investigators said today.
The councillor was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office, where he remains to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction department 'Suelo Industrial y Vivienda'.
The three arrests are in connection with searches already last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land were to be converted for urban development projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4,000 apartments on the property after receiving illegal commissions from the local administration during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested but subjected to an investigation initiated and carried out by the first Totonas court.
The first six arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to the investigative bodies, the former mayor of Totana and the current independent PP MP Juan Morales are also under investigation.
His ex-wife, owner of a registered real estate company in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia, are also suspects.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G., whose companies were a subgroup of Nuaria and allegedly received the bribes.
The investigation is being carried out by the Municipal Authority for Urban Decen­saries, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out 11 additional searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly linked to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a well-known poultry farm in the region, who was said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria project was commissioned to build the largest housing complex in the Murcian region, comprising more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana for redevelopment, with the goal of building a project that would increase the population of the community to 25,000.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking lots in Vigo on the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector; and Preconiza, which specialises in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
The first.
If you agree, we will move away from the term 'Book of the Month' and try to invent a different name for the prize with the appropriate competence.
I already have a suggestion.
People, life is about change.
Of course, you are welcome to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains the commentary published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is, by the way, at the head of the PISA study), which relates to the commentary published in the same newspaper on 18 November, coincidentally on the same day as the publication of the review of the book Blackburn.
The content of the philosophy course has become a subject of public debate following the tragedy at Jokela school.
The man responsible for the brutal murders is a high school graduate who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The chairman of the philosophy education board, Pekka Elo, in an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, urged teachers to take a more critical stance towards Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching be removed from the sub-level curricula for the philosophy subject in secondary schools.

A colleague reports on the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, punishable by six months in prison.
If you rob a music store for less than 400 euros, this is considered a simple offence (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the store up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
Participation in a rebellious dispute is punishable by imprisonment from three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while data sharing is punishable by imprisonment from six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The sale of copyright-protected films which have not been authorized by the authors is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone has screwed up their demands.

My family doctor hands me one of his long, strange research papers, titled, "Money Activates Certain Brain Areas, Especially When Others Get More of It".
So the feelings that come from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was carried out by a magnetic tomography reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Life&Brain brain research centre in Bonn, "activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed".
The researchers found that when both participants were correct and were paid the same amount, their brain activity was always very moderate, but when one of them was paid twice as much, their brain activity was also higher.
I am not quite sure that it actually takes that much scientific effort to arrive at such a result.
The Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly investigating the perpetrators of the Balkan wars for the past eight years, based in the prosecutor's office of the former Yugoslav Criminal Court in The Hague.
Her term of office will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with tears and a smile on her face as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, namely former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain at large.
Their names are on a list created by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary film "La Lista de Carla" (2006, not yet released in Spain), a film that follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in the pace of a political thriller, in her quest to track down the escaped criminals and pressure the governments to tighten their nets.
What insurance plan is best for me?
Car insurance covering possible damage caused by the driver is a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right car model.
First of all, you have to understand what we're dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insured person.
This agreement is made in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company will receive the agreed insurance premium and is obliged to provide the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance policy which is composed of several factors, including age, sex, date of issue of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher premiums are due if there is a higher risk of accidents.
This is why both over 25s and women have to pay less, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, who, according to statistics and thus also according to the belief of the undertakings, are less likely to have accidents than single persons.
The benefit attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
The insurance companies must take into account a number of factors when setting the premium.
This is why the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose the car insurance policy that best meets his personal needs.
We now list the main points to consider when choosing an insurance policy in order to make a choice based not only on performance but also on price.
The choice of a cheap insurance policy for those under 25 is hampered by a number of obstacles, such as lack of experience and a 'young' driving licence.
Even if the best way to obtain the best insurance coverage is to take out a full-scale insurance policy, there are cheaper alternatives.
The prudent driver can choose a self-insured full-cask insurance, so that the benefits of a full-cask insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves the customer having to pay a part of the amount of the damage itself.
"The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and depends on the level of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid", explains Luis Noguera, Spain's chief representative at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage but not against damage to the car itself.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire, and vehicle loss.
Here's a word of advice.
If you are under 25, it is up to you to reduce insurance costs, thus increasing your credit by trying to drive safely and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the insurance company concerned.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the tariff.
The amount of credits and fines depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a good year, it can afford to increase the bonus payments", explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is passed, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract, because the accident rate decreases as driving practice increases.
The most sensible option is to opt for a self-insurance scheme.
"Typically, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, either in the event of an accident or at the time of driving", explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of training after the "beginner's fear" has been put down.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out a full-scale insurance policy, of course only if the financial situation of the person concerned allows it.
The insurance companies consider couples with children to be the customers with the lowest accident rate and their contributions are also low accordingly.
In this case, full-scale insurance with self-insurance (around 300 euros) would be the best option.In the case of a high credit, extended insurance, which only starts in the third year of the vehicle, is recommended.
"They drive more relaxed overall and have greater purchasing power, which allows them to make higher contributions", notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is possible to take out a full-scale insurance with self-insurance (around EUR 150) or an extended insurance scheme, which is only used if the credit is sufficiently high.
Finally, it must be said that car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidental damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough selection that is appropriate to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow are hoping to score points in Milan for the last eight
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the missing point in San Siro next Tuesday to reach their respective goals before the Champions League preliminary round, with the Italians needing the point to top their group while the Scots will be the ones to decide their participation.
The Italian team already has five points and confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not overtake Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two matches of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round of matches as FC Milan have to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they will compete for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th, which will take place on the 16th.
The Italian side will not want to speculate at home that Celtic Glasgow knows that if they win they would be first in the group and thus have a better starting position in the last eight.
Gordon Strachan's team could even lose a match against FC Shakhtar to qualify, but he should not rely too much on such circumstances, as the Ukrainians are tied on nine points, having lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to ruin the night for the Scots, who are again hoping to reach the last eight of the re-formed Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal from Kaka in the play-offs (1-0) and by a 0-0 draw in the second leg.
While FC Shakhtar awaits the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to concentrate on its own game, as both reaching the last eight and its membership in UEFA depend on its victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Benfica Lisbon, despite its lowest position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to play in the biggest European championship, could win third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people are in Vancouver for the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour after the band's break-up in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was 'excellent'.
The 20,000-plus people who attended the sold-out stadium were treated to a video of the band's history, which had caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The reunion and world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their greatest hits and two more new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo", released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on stage, which had been given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds of fans who lit up the GM Palace, despite the nerves of his wife Victoria, who had forbidden it in the days before.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star "has never seen our wardrobe, so I'm very curious to know what he will think of the performance".
Sporty Spice, who left the group in 1998 "due to internal disagreements" and two years later the group disbanded, expressed her nervousness at a press conference two hours before the concert.
"I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I could see that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made that decision", Chisholm said of the band's breakup she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that "the disputes have been resolved and everyone is now very happy again".
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
First, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane, according to a report by CTV.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will next perform in California, San José (December 4), and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be on stage in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears over gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is raging between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russian fuel exports to Western Europe will be affected.
The bulk of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will be charged higher transit fees by Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced shipments to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine will have to be charged more as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the main transit countries in talks", Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine".
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices up sharply.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom is supplementing its own gas reserves with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish National Health Service needs to improve checks on the criminal records of workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation by Chief Financial Officer Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in connection with the Glasgow airport bombing in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish National Health Service did not have precise figures on the number of foreign staff.
But his report indicated that other important checks were done correctly on a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Officer examined staff recruited from outside the European Economic Area following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an SUV drove through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Old Bailey in a video broadcast in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
The National Health Service is expected to carry out checks prior to the recruitment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Health Authorities use Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The Auditor-General's report now states, among other recommendations, that the Board should take up guidelines from the Criminal Records extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we have found references to these checks in some personnel files, they were not routinely carried out", the report noted.
Black said the Scottish Health Authorities would follow their pre-employment screening guidelines to a high degree, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign healthcare workers is available".
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that research prior to hiring potential NHS staff would identify people who might commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the current NHS Scotland pre-feasibility tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver", he said.
The Scottish Health Authority says that it currently has 1,161 foreign staff, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, partly because the boards would have trouble identifying those employees who are on indefinite leave.
The investigation also found that established control procedures were overwhelmingly followed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was concerned to do this work in the light of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport".
She added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take the recommendations of the report into account and ensure that best practices are reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment screening of all staff - including those from abroad - due to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the film biography of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded Best Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - featuring the soundtracks of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was made for just £3 million.
Nevertheless, it won Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree, two awards - for best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, which was named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened the doors to people like me", he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored".
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terror plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has detained 208 militants for their affiliation with cells that were planning an imminent attack on an oil plant and on clerics and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, in the wake of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, planned to attack an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid response force to protect facilities following an al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Interior Ministry, says that 18 of those arrested were from a cell run by a "missile expert" who had entered the country illegally.
He reports that the militants were planning to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of those detained were reportedly planning to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis seeking to go to Iraq to join al Qaeda militias fighting allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which hardliners among Sunni Saudis regard as heretical.
Al Qaeda militias see many clerics in Saudi Arabia as collaborating with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months", a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also included a 16-member "media cell" from Medina, which was aimed at promoting "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims who are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could give a glimpse of the future of the Earth
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet is even more like an Earth-like twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have been in conditions very similar to those on Earth, and scientists now believe that it might even have been habitable.
But because of the unchecked greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation, and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a very different course of evolution.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is being devastated by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which has studied the planets for a year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth might evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, whereas the planets are otherwise quite similar".
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario where Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment".
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
It 's all open
Mitt Romey said he doesn't think it's worthy of a presidential candidate to be interviewed by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidate eventually agreed to take part in a YouTube debate, where ordinary voters record and submit questions to be sent to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time, reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party, which is heading into next year's elections.
It's not known, just like the producers of CNN who helped support the debate, who selected the upcoming candidate's YouTube clips to show.
However, the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, was all about immigration.
That's one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to go to a polling station when they heard things they liked: The network noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke strictly about borders.
The most intense and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who has pushed himself forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation that he was lenient with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
The two were particularly bitter when the questioner asked whether either candidate would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegal immigrants a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Minority candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, were able to catch up on the issue.
Neither of these men has a serious chance at the nomination, but they both stay in the race, perhaps because they've hit the immigration loop harder and earlier than others.
At least on the immigration front, the candidates share broadly the same views: tighter borders, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were brought up.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the interviewers asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to the view that although the Bible was his favorite book, he might not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus supported the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all odds, ranked first in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed on whether Jesus would endorse her, he laughed and said that Jesus was too intelligent to run for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his thunderous applause in Wednesday's debate.
These two have been thrown up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate has united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the greatness of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall into; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sold, no politicians paid Paris hotel bills, no extra-marital toes have been licked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman had been hiding donations to the British ruling Labour Party of more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) over four years under other people's names, and that the party had failed to report this, is something that the contender Gordon Brown would have done well without.
When the Prime Minister two months ago refused to call an election, foolishly insulting the intelligence of the British people by claiming that opinion polls had no bearing on that decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly perceptive chairman of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once-feared Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a struggling bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change tax laws have angered business associations against the government.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities revealed unimaginable administrative fraud.
A trio of retired generals started a revolt in the House of Lords against military spending cuts, claiming that being Minister of Defence was a part-time job.
Now there are the multiple donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and its former head of fulfillment) has already resigned.
None of this means Brown is going to resign.
Yet governments may reach a turning point where they feel that they cannot govern.
People may not trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it's clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he doesn't even need to be around for long, that delay is over: the public service starts leaking; the cabinet ministers start babbling; the press searches for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction files, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's misadventures - as in the long "money for titles" investigation of political party funding - voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely swindled.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new wave of political donations is a good example.
The scumbag Abraham, who compares his donations to his charitable giving, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be true, but it was not his decision.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear, and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's deal but not that it was illegal, will of course have to ask some questions, just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief financial officer, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He was quick to condemn the violation of the law by his party, but he watered down that determination by resorting to a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry into the matter - led to the full measure, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a sweeping reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to abandon the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a Party member like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some biased facts.
The Conservatives are now clearly ahead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unchallenged integrity and solid competence.
Sharks
Is the credit crisis affecting America's credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's only natural for the dorsal fin to spin around excitedly.
Now that America's housing market is in decline, predators are targeting the nation's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both write-downs and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are either non-recoverable or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion charge from its U.S. consumer finance, in part because of the weakness of credit cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and casualties are still low.
According to Moody's, the third-quarter seed rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in US private bankruptcy law in 2005 led to a sharp fall in bankruptcy filings, which again account for a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would rise again whether or not the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
And confidence in credit card-based securities is pretty strong, despite the stagnation in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research firm, expects that spending volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the housing credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt as home loans dry up.
However, card issuers look at cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be of benefit to the card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the real estate is worth less than the value of the loan, and as a result card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond to the more volatile conditions much more quickly and flexibly than lenders by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and completely revaluate the loans", says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
Even if a sudden credit card market underwriting crisis is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and credit reduction push America into recession, industry will no doubt face a grimmer future.
Keep an eye out for those shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to stand trial for their role in the fraudulent scheme with former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow changed their pleas to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of wire fraud for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
The three former senior executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, came to light in the UK during two years of extradition proceedings.
In the United States, her case is the loose end of an investigation that began after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges initially brought against her in 2002 brought Fastow to the attention of the public that he was the target of a government investigation in connection with the Enron collapse.
The indictment against the bankers, known as the NatWest Three, alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron schemes that helped to drive the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its holding in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company under Kopper's control bought the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its stake in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Copper and others withheld about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enron bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence at the Louisiana State Penitentiary.
Copper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on a $1 million bond, which required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer mask the billions in debt or make weakening businesses look profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of over 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were overturned after he died of heart disease last year.
Not down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's a small amount of money for some of the rich Russians.
"It can seat up to 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for that many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president".
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of show-business consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers had set up booths, hoping to attract newly-income Russians to everything from mahogany-plated yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be reasonable for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us", he said.
"Russia is the second largest market for private jets after the United States".
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas was in its heyday.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans got enormous wealth and went in droves to Europe, where they were considered materialistic", said Marshall Goldman, a scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian flyovers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the most visible and generous money spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking to take their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference of the luxury industry this week attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who have a total of $282 billion, according to Forbes' list of the richest people.
Moreover, 103,000 Russian millionaires are in the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a think tank here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had first visited the fair together with the Russian retailer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-groomed and the men are all worth a fortune".
As they walk through the halls Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I've been looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The show seemed primarily aimed at the newly rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic for hours to visit a swollen warehouse that shamelessly stacked Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears.
Tickets were available for the public for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaics.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in clippers".
In fact, the dealers here say that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from big-time logos to the kind of sober brands with limited numbers that wouldn't be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaire envoys, or tourists, poured through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, sewn with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three car radiators for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that resemble interlocking chain-arm tires for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had coated with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-piece.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels", Mr Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his garage of 30 or 40 cars".
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash", he said.
"There are more of them than you think".
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company had set up four red telephone booths, modeled after British ones, filled with piles of counterfeit million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake bills for the millionaire's fair.
Passersby stopped to throw money piles around, cell phone photos while reclining amidst the surplus wealth, getting their hair cut by friends, or just to get a few million.
"Look, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", Mr. Karryev said.
Suspected malfunction in New Jersey death
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance on the white Cape Cod stopped two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police car was there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's boxcar coming", said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died".
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom police have not identified, who worked at the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help unravel a mysterious death that has sent mourning through the top of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to Police Chief Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious", Mr McCarthy said of Ms Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me".
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Board, and that she left behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators are trying to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical treatment.
"That's one way", said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation".
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have given little notice of their investigation or of the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh wouldn't say if Mrs. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if any part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes were hanging from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him adjust to the provincial and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing".
Hopes that the central bank will cut interest rates will lead to a rise in world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the Fed would try to calm credit markets by further interest rate cuts were bolstered by soothing comments from the vice chairman of the Fed.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number two of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said that policy must be "flexible and pragmatic" in response to the continued pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down frenetic markets in the face of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market performance from the latter part of September and October".
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of consumers' rights in the event of a serious accident, which is not covered by the directive, is not yet in force.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank was ready to step in and stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The comments also helped calm Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the US economy, now that US property sales hit a new record low in October.
The impact of the financial turmoil was underscored by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost-cutting measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6 per cent and France's CAC40 rose by 2.3 per cent.
The re-emergence of credit pressure on markets had previously been highlighted after strong demand for three-month European Central Bank guarantee funds granted to European commercial banks was awarded at a considerable 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the US central bank and the European central bank to follow suit and to infuse more capital into the money markets in London increased as credit tensions saw the three-month "Libor" rates on borrowing between UK banks rise to their highest since late September at 6.59 percent, after a continuous rise since 21 November.
England faced with decision on Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara's testimony
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to be the number six for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the Electoral Commission, is here on call, at least under this particular title, to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the desk of High Morries, the English chief executive, is gradually filling up with applications for national electorates, if not even part-time ones.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth batting position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to pinpoint exactly what enables one person to reach the top of his or her profession, while another never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
It's not just in cricket that the choices are difficult, that judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is this the right time for Bopara to ascend?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same question may be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees and good knowledge of the business, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or to sink.
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain at the right time when he can take a wicket and a batsman must get regular chances on the order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better than, say, James Anderson last season, who is likely to play in the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and the wind is blowing in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each to earn a place in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and was successful in the first, taking five wickets and 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to establish himself, who made the breakthrough into a major Test cricketer and who, although he scored a double century against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underrated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion in the course of today's web session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feelings for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Shah is best remembered for his sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class centuries and only six from Bopara, who is seven years his junior at 22, and an excellent balance against spin balls.
But Shah scored just ten runs in his two innings in May against the West Indies in the Test at Lord's, his home ground as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection by the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take his position back for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum from his strikes, which were still evident in Bombay.
The man from Essex, on the other hand, has a shallow sense of joy.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket field and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he recently ran over a four-wheel-drive vehicle at an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching from a distance, and say enthusiastically, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better pitcher, he's bowling his middle pace with some effect here on the pitches, which seems to suit him and he's hitting with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean Shah might not be in a good place if, as the Ceylon tea party suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have run out, and others hoping the city will return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them from their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan returning in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad", said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers about what happened in Baghdad and how safe it would be now".
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to withdraw for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow him to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local, US-backed militia had helped drive Al-Qaeda out of their stronghold in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, by a hand grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That is why I returned today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop build-up and the growth of local "groups of concerned citizens" who are armed and working with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more said they had been forced home by visa problems and cash-strapped Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country's sectarian death squads.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government pushed to stop issuing visas to Iraqis to force them to return to Iraq", the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left".
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shiite neighborhoods and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and lead to conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even excels in the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one area of education do the Saarland countries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-Saarlander for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this is the slogan the smallest of the federal states posters ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the Institute of German Economics' Education Monitor Cologne (IW).
The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students here can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
The proportion of foreign students is therefore high at 15.6%.
But the Saarland also attends higher education in higher numbers than the average number of rural children - many of them without a high school diploma.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used", says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their qualifications at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also comparatively strong.
The number of students studying in dual programmes is the second highest in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite the practical training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
The Saarland Ministry of Education has therefore now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"We have initiated a number of reforms in the general education sector since the first Pisa study", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
In order to ensure that children start their studies earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge - a model that is now being copied by other federal states.
Whether the performance of pupils is improving in the long term will be shown by future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of high-risk pupils fell from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians are better at calculating.
And to the chagrin of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise you could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in secondary schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks
Venezuela's clocks are about to start ticking differently than the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez turns the clock back by half an hour in the South American country.
In Spain, Chavez is becoming a joke.
According to the official newspaper of Venezuela, a new law will set the clocks to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The US-hostile Chávez justified his decision by saying, among other things, that the United States had imposed the division of the world into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the severance of relations with neighboring Colombia over a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will have no relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it because of my dignity alone", said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the country's citizens will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spit in the face" of Venezuela with his decision, he had criticized Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chavez is the talk of the town.
A new mobile phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people from the Internet.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos spoke, annoyed at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant interludes of the left-wing populist and having overcome him.
German threat 2007 wage minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts gave a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect to earn less in real terms in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The reason for this is the modest wage growth, the increase in value-added tax and the price surges in food and energy", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the Bild newspaper.
The new burden on workers could also be applied to unemployment insurance.
The Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
The Federal Agency for Labour should not be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or subsidies, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the explosion in food and petroleum products had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
The prices increased by 3,0% year on year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has detected lightning flashes in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, just as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that lightning strikes on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 35 miles [56 km], reports Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the science magazine Nature.
The famous "origin theory" holds that lightning caused life on earth: thunderstorms in the ocean triggered reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been there in the very early history", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is little life on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius are sometimes observed.
"Venus may be the devil's twin to Earth, but she is a twin", Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has taken on such a completely different development is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the history of Venus exploration, since no spacecraft had been on the road since the early 1990's.
The latest research, now being presented in several Nature articles, not only underscores the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, the researchers say.
"They also show that our neighbouring planet has more in common with Earth than was initially thought", ESA said.
In addition to the already known North Pole whirlwind, the researchers found a swirl of clouds at the South Pole that rotates much faster.
The phenomenon resembles air currents in the Earth's winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-closest planet in our solar system is nearly the same mass as Earth, and at a diameter of some 12,000 miles [12,100 km], it is almost as big.
The planet, also called the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it spins much more slowly around itself: A day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus' surface temperature is 460 degrees Celsius and its pressure is 92 bar, scientists believe that both planets formed under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained in the oceans on Earth, but on Venus it was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is fixed in carbonate rocks, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not present the outside world with a divided nation on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding of the Dalai Lama's reception by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universal to me, even though I respect the diversity of cultures", said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took the blame for the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not abandoned her traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too", said Köhler.
The European Union has been attacked for expressing its displeasure at the Dalai Lama's reception.
Mr Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "showcase policy" in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery, there were intense irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership has not only expelled German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL information, it has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministries.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
China has rejected any official reception by European politicians of the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao reiterated the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the rest of the Tibetan region, which includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like in France.
The Federal Minister of the Interior called for all efforts to ensure that social discontent in Germany did not turn violent on the streets.
Barricades were burned, rioters fired shotguns at the police: after the serious youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must be careful that we do not build up social explosives and release them by force.
We have to take this seriously", he told the Hannover-based Neue Presse.
Not every young person can cope with the rapidly changing social reality.
The Federal, Länder and municipalities were already working hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes are already being shown".
But it is too early to warn.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, youths had been fighting with the police in the streets in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burning in Toulouse.
The German Turkish Community's chairman, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as volatile as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under 25 years of age is "above average".
The first thing is to provide more training places.
Kolat stressed that "we need to give young people a perspective".
The chairman of the Turkish Community added, however, that "social control in the family" is more prevalent in Germany than in France.
Many young people with immigrant backgrounds also did not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat warned: "But we must be careful".
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft directive on the protection of young people's rights.
Meanwhile, the night was largely quiet in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were on the scene, a helicopter flew over the area with spotlights.
Authorities reported three arrests and a couple of burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the day before, a contingent of about 1,000 security forces has been keeping the peace.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
On the night of Tuesday, some 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were sparked by a traffic accident that killed two teenagers on Sunday.
According to the initial findings of the prosecution, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the teenagers.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor's unrealistic appearance documents that the coalition is at its end - and that nothing can be expected of her.
What country does this Chancellor live in?
After her dismal appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was furious and lacking in content, one must say: not here - not in the country which would finally have to be ruled by her.
The accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy was rejected by Angela Merkel with a bitterly arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said, and she showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has made it clear to all that her accusation is true.
There was no real interest in, or even a feeling for, the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself as a disgraced politician who is running away to foreign policy and stays in the dark.
The Commission is not in a position to accept the amendments, but it is in a position to accept them.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a directive.
Now she's clinging to the floss, so the upheaval can come to the people.
It damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking about the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a fringe phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low-income?
She's got a few extra sentences left.
The number of times she promises to be a good mother is telling.
Merkel needs three tries to get a halfway straight sentence.
She'll stumble on the ground when it's done.
Attack team
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are in for a hard-fought battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tensions between the candidates are clear from the first topic.
He's made New York a "sanctuary for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani, for his part, counters with heavy charges: "I would say his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants", Giuliani countered, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of privately employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are on the attack: With the Republican base still without a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-directed 30-second videos that Internet users uploaded via YouTube are little more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we brought Hitler to power", John McCain blames his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a lot of praise from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn what's called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning as torture.
But the main themes of the campaign have now moved beyond the Iraq war and torture debates, as the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the audience applauds.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong", Romney says cringe-stricken, pleading with grassroots and television audiences that he was still among the pro-abortion crowd in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is caught off guard when asked what he thinks about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian
One day after he resigned as army chief, Pakistan's ruler, Musharraf, was sworn in as president.
Ending eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to uphold the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus evading international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after taking the oath, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, fulfilling another Western demand.
The country's Supreme Court, which had been filled with lawyers who had been with Musharraf since the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, an attack on a military convoy killed five soldiers and wounded four others.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghan border.
The Fathers of the Grass Roots are returning
Germany's supergroup of the seventies is playing music again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
The revival features a recording of their big time hit "Live 1974".
Even then they were much more famous abroad.
The sensation that is intended then takes place in the form of three gentlemen sitting at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box, their cables and, most importantly, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the bloody white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
On the left, Michael Rother, 57 years old, in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, seen from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves, concentrating on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
It doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The band's return to music has caused some excitement amongst the Krautrock fans.
And I can tell you that, in fact, targeted searches have shown that while the name has been in the collective pop memory, it's not at all sustainable enough to have painfully missed this band for 32 years.
But why should the Germans not be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the 1970s?
In particular, what is misleadingly called weed dressing was always more valuable in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life's Work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, the audience was filled with German pop faces asking questions.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the La Dusseldorf and Neu! bands in the Laudatio, the amazement was boundless.
At concerts, Michael Rother would later join the Red Hot Chili Peppers onstage like an old pal.
The problem of ignorance at home and of the deception abroad is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony because the trio existed for only two years and during this time also developed a far less potent force than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously worked with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first, the music was played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label run by the church.
Rother had briefly worked at Kraftwerk and then made a name for himself as a guitarist in Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-run communards.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to torture himself as a nanny.
More like a high-profile artist.
It was also said that the garbage contained a wimpel of the singing group Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of it was Harmony's.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the next one was called "De Luxe".
Because as quiet and humble as the music sounded, the band was suffering from material hardship.
The collection of travels was not just for self-discovery.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a recording audience of almost 50 people, as one might imagine.
Rother had a desire to force harmony and to practice it occasionally.
For Rodelius and Moebius, an immoral demand.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric realm and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album by Griessem is the work of Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of nurturing Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
It was already excavated like a solo work by Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia is taking place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British alt-punk and author of the book "Herb Rock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of influences of grassroots rock on subsequent pop music.
Harmonia is filling the supergroup vacancy.
Brian Eno's line floats with the most bizarre sounds in the room: "The only true music, yours is the future".
There are pictures of the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
The legend is formed by projecting additional black and white photographs of devices that are wired in a confused way.
Before that, the three veterans are back to improvising.
No longer by gluing microphones to the organ and drums to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments through self-made effects.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tech-savvy fools.
The house choir won't change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, the song is whistled and whistled under a sound cloud and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!"
Weed was always a very English word.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever shouts '68' is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia cannot be relieved of that now.
Even the most obvious things are thought through on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
It can be nerve-racking or bring fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murder Peace", two more films deal with the Balkan War.
But neither is convincing.
Either the concepts are too action-oriented and gestural or they're too touching.
That's not what Richard Gere can do in "The Hunting Party".
The good news is that although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely there, in the dark backdrop of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere has been found.
We had lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s because too many nice, unimportant roles in female-oriented films and too many press conferences on Buddhism made you want to look away.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and confusing these days like a train driver's lease?)
He gives a wonderfully eye-winking account: Basically, his war correspondent Simon Hunt is what Gere might have become if fate and the film industry had not been so gracious: a man whose best days are long behind him, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, has retained considerable remnants of his former charm.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party" along with the German production of "Killer Peace", which also opens this week, is just continuing the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
"Murder Peace" is a short process: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from Kosovar snipers, which promptly makes one fall in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not the sole cause of all evil, the television film is losing itself too quickly in the midst of talk and action.
It's still a kind of Cobra 11 alarm without the highway but with war.
The Hunting Party, on the other hand, is an exemplary exploration of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters setting out to track down the Serbian war criminal "The Fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at a different time with a different director and a different screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times, small teams go into the woods to accomplish something the military can't, and both times it's a journey into madness.
One of the reasons "The Hunting Party" failed is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the down-on-his-luck cynic with a heart as he's presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also inspire him to have a romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
And finally, The Hunting Party will go down the drain when the reporters in the last five minutes of the time-out process do what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to their just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still free and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to agree on this occasion) of not intensifying the persecution because of secret political arrangements.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar that one remembers a famous Brecht poem.
It says of the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I see with compassion the swollen cheeks, suggesting how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have just such shrewd minds, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not confined to the genre of Balkan war films.
Recently, this paper reported that all of Hollywood's Iraq movies were big flops.
I would add that there has never been a good South African film.
Almost always, when a star wanders the world's crisis hotspots or minefields, they come up with something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Borders" with Angelina Jolie, or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It took decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with Schindler's List.
Some films will probably mature - the Vietnamese classics "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were not universally celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe we know now where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the writers of the recklessness that it takes to tell a good story.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you need to have the sarcastically distant artistic vision of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change.
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrible ways, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust criticised for Olympic withdrawal
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with harsh criticism from politicians and businessmen alike.
Many want to continue fighting for the water games.
But von Beust urges realism in the assessment of the chances.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, said on Wednesday that a resignation was "not good for the economic location".
No other project has unleashed such a great motivation in the city in recent times as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the momentum of sport policy could not be maintained to the same extent".
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it "based on a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday maintained earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic competition, but the German Olympic Sports Federation", said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbond, expected in early December, on Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period up to 2028 as we have envisaged".
Nevertheless, the dream was not forever forgotten, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will not be competing in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to take a chance by burying the plans at this stage", HSB President Günter Plos said on Wednesday.
The refusal to apply is also contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
In the same letter, von Beust described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD citizens' group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has put its bets on the Olympia map and left out housing", said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the small Grasbrook has always called for integrated planning for Olympia and subsequent residential use, the CDU has unilaterally opted for the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics had caused a great deal of excitement in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg had failed at Leipzig.
These aren 't Warhol 's boxes .
If you think of Sweden and the wooden box, you think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
You think so?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue.
Most of the 94 "Stockholm type" eyeglass cases listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 eyeglass cases, internal investigations at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm have now reached a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo boxes" that former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies - and probably most of the around 100 other "Stockholm-type" eyeglass cases in circulation on the international art market.
The history is tangled, a confusing interlocking of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the paper cartons of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
They were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to have a few wooden brillo boxes produced in Sweden, but these were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes which, at the time, were authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Stockholm type" and have rightly entered art and auction history.
Some of them have sold for over $100,000 at auctions.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around 100 wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 and that Warhol then left them to him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six museum-owned brillo boxes, Lars Byström, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three privately owned Swedish brillo boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first ground and smudged, then painted white with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, however, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press plate with a paint roll without a base - and it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's brillo boxes", says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve. "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not reach a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibit materials".
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it was investigating the "serious allegations" made in the case of the soap powder boxes.
But ever since, there has been a relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had taken refuge in a Manila hotel have surrendered to demand the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot be held responsible for bloodshed, leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been locked in the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003, among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police who were supposed to be guarding him had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops surrounded the hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough", said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us".

United Internet becomes major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, the company said on Wednesday evening.
You now hold 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There had been speculation about a takeover.
The option of increasing the proportion of Versatel is left open.
The move is aimed at consolidating the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Earlier on Wednesday, speculation had already surfaced about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house only held the shares for a third party, the financial market said.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares of the company for 31.4 million euros.
The companies also entered into discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", a United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies have set up the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to settle for a good 10 percent stake in Freenet and not use their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies, however, remained open to all options, including in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had been concluded in mid-November.
The months-long and difficult to trace poker around Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile subscribers and 1.27 million DSL and full-line subscribers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch previously held directly 6.01% of Freenet's shares.
It was agreed that Drillisch would bring in another four per cent.
The right to buy 18.49% from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
