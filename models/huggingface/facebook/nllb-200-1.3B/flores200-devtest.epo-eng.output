Although one experimental vaccine appears capable of reducing Ebola mortality, so far no treatment has clearly proven to be usable to treat the existing infection.
One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicate that it is less effective than expected in preventing death.
In a trial of PALM, ZMapp served as a control, meaning that scientists were using it as a benchmark to compare three other treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and recognizes that the Olympic family certainly needs the development of a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the UOK's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, rather than by the loss of a certificate.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the misuse of the scale, so courageously described by Larry Nassar's survivors, could have gone unnoticed for so long, and welcomes any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the UOK share the same goal  to make the sport of gymnastics, and the others, as safe as possible, so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot give, like color or three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown with pale or carotenoid-colored lower edges.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a well-developed stem called a raky, but they do have other features of feathers -- branches and twigs -- the researchers concluded that the raky is probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers speculated that the specimen shows an adult feather and not a go-down, although it is a tail of a young dinosaur.
The researchers speculated that the specimen showed an adult feather and not a goose bump, although it was a tail of a young dinosaur.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office reported that nineteen of the injured were police officers.

They found that the Sun operates according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by nothing else but their brightness and their rotation.
The brightness and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby index of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby index, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic inversions.

The work done was largely theoretical, however the program was written to simulate an observation made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team looked for the effect that tidal forces would cause between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the darkest matter around a galaxy is a kind of halo surrounding a galaxy and is made up of many small particles.
TV reports show white smoke coming from the power plant.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered Extremely Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant is "very much disturbing and alarming, because it has a very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have been infected with the bacteria in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two of them are hospital health workers.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people in their vicinity.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of TB patients appears to be small; 6,000 of the total 330,000 infected at any given time in South Africa.

"Their temperature behavior is not as stable as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with those that are deep caves in the ground", said Glen Cushing of an astrogeological team at the U.S. Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a technologically simple experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put the pre-printed sheet of paper with an indication of their preferred candidate in an envelope.
Once officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, polling stations have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest to the absence of envelopes before the start of the election and that no envelopes are added except those of the orderly counted and entitled voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under careful control, according to specific procedures.

However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since remained in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of murdering his son.
She is being held pending an official indictment and trial, but any witness testimony may be affected because her image has been widely publicized.
It's common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently, and courts look at the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists do seem to be approaching a dangerous line when they publish photos or other details of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for prosecution, clarified to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the prosecution is made.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants to have based on the pre-1967 Middle East war.
Other issues that are likely to be discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, while the PA agrees to leave the presence for only five years.
Shooters in the auxiliary pest control trial had to be carefully monitored by the foresters, while the trial was studied and its effectiveness assessed.
In partnership with NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooters Association (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers will be recruited as part of a hunting program by the Sport Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation were given detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
Martelly's first CEO in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a measure to advance the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were sparked by the failed organisation of elections, some of which were postponed from 2011.
About 60 incidents of non-functioning iPods being found to be frozen are reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEKI) has reported 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week MEKI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 new incidents of find-cooling, which the company calls "minor".
The ministry reacted by calling Apple's delay in the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake hit Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Office of Emergency Management said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong as hostages, seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been released, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed his father's example and chose a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth during his free time.
His research showed that delivering the hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetal lung in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid homage to Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night of two moons.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the poll share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II would be the last Australian monarch.
At the extreme end of the opinion poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist had to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints cast doubt on his ability.
He could not take the medication needed to cope with his pain, as they are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Some people confirmed the discovery, using various hardware and software, until the early days of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may eventually be a source of water supply for the Earth, as well as of organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow flying machines to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while also reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate flying devices with greater accuracy and to give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is being operated, and the overland trains will not stop at Wembley, nor are there parking lots or parking-and-driving facilities on site.
Fear of lack of transportation raised the likelihood that the game would be played behind closed doors, without supporters from the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Upsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process is believed to have taken longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin fringe, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus fringe, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in a variety of ways. It can be rolled down to thin designs.
You can pull it to get a thin wire, which can be folded and braided, and then you can hammer it or roll it to a sheet.
You can make it very thin and stick it to another metal, and it's so thin that it was once used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using beet juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been deprived of their electrons (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a spray toilet in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage have been found in the houses of the mining towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the phone call and sends it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
You need a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has made possible is providing a much easier and faster transportation.
Because of it we have a train, a car and many other means of transport.
Below them are the more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey on the scale from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including homeless pets) that eat the much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is a concept of niche, a specialization that each cat retains, so they don't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in groups called herds.
Gregon consists of one to three related adult males and many to thirty females and young.
The females are usually in close kinship with each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds function quite similarly to herds of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to the prey.
A very harmonious athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times harder than a strong man.
A tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of rough, shouting words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds as much as possible.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find edible animals (prey) by smell, smelling the tracks on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very subtly. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the surrounding environment and then attacking them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) split from the main population from which it originates (as if they cross a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island, so they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from that in which they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to, to be a strong competitor, have different characteristics or adaptations than they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, over the course of thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take out carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is vegetable. Without vegetables, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the greatest predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in its mouthpiece, meaning that nothing that met it could escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a bipedal tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water, even a giant dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus would have no chance against it.
Although you would recognize most of their food, the Romans did have their own set of strange or unusual feasting items, including wild pig, peacock, snail and a type of rodent called a glira.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have parties together where they would lie on their sides and eat their own dishes.
Among the dishes of Ancient Rome there could not be foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and also an inner sanctuary, which was only open to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't that important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family took place in the fresh air.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simply open sales desks in front of the street. They used stone to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norwegian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and along the way westward, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of what he discovered, Inuit tribes had already lived there by then.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in the early days of its existence the large parchment document (its dimensions are 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for holding.
So it's probably just a label.
The landings of D-Day and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, these were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly larger group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that also defines the dimension of society in some way.
City-states are the ancestors of nations. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over a few generations, a continuous cultural trail and a fairly large dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving a relevant historical record and fail to be recognized as appropriate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government with a congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked any power to collect taxes and, as there was no national executive or justice, it entrusted the execution of its decisions to state bodies, which were often not cooperative.
Nor could it override tax laws and customs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before any change, and states approached the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, are the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, so Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, in a geographical sense, an "archipel".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors in transit recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founded a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the indigenous ways of grain production and hiring Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) occupied western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for capturing still images is 35 mm, which was the dominant film dimension at the close of the era of analog film.
It's still in production today, but more importantly, its proportions have been inherited from the sensitive formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, a bit confusing, 36 mm wide and 34 mm high.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is thus called 3:2.
Several popular formats (APS format, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The much-insulted and often ridiculed rule of thirds is simply a guideline that creates dynamism, keeping a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective location of the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, became the object of critical investigation.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-encompassing power touched everyone from king to citizen.
One of the main Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to reduce suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist specifically for this purpose.
For over a thousand years the central authority of the church was in Rome and this concentration of power and money made many doubt whether this dogma is obeyed.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in a number of international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain traversed international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Since such tactics had a limited reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited military use of submarines.
During the 1912s the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid a recurrence of such a situation in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at the former workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had its own way of showing different time periods; each era in China or each family that ruled was a separate dynasty.
The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those periods fierce fighting took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
In addition, after the Revolution, positions were open to all male candidates, which allowed success for the most ambitious and successful.
The same is true of the military, because instead of military ranks that were previously based on class, they were now based on personality.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this everyday life. He frequented a cave, which became known as Hira, on Mount Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has been preserved through time, gives a clear picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
Located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find one, even if you know it exists. When you're in the cave, it's a complete isolation.
Nothing else is visible except the cloudless, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world is seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramidal structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and among the smaller pyramids, many tombs and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "arc up" mark looks like a V and the "arc down mark" like a bracket or square without a bottom side.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the heel (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward arch usually produces a more delicate sound, while the downward arch is stronger and firmer.
Do not hesitate to add your own stamps with a pencil, but remember that the printed stamps are there for a musical purpose, so they should usually be observed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth were on 6 October 1789 brought back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women.
They drove to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd, making noise and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd made the king and queen open the carriage windows wide.
At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the frightened queen.
The military expenses of the American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to compensate for a large part of the expenses and the percentage of the bonds circulating in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the surplus profits derived from the vast exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic income of the American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that helped the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is usually called the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ends by consensus around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers in practice a wide range of ideas, from the technological push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influences, and that technology in turn has for societies consequences that are inherently its own, rather than socially conditioned.
One might say, for example, that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being designed to lower the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals and with the passage of time appeared customs and culture associated with this geography, and those, more harmonious with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
In the twelfth century its status declined mainly because the crusaders returned with silks and spices considered more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow pace of media, Western styles could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major achievements of the period was the use of buttons to fasten clothes as a result of the Crusades.
A subsistence agriculture is an agriculture carried out to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seeds indigenous to the ecoregion with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to grow a crop.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring people together with similar views, who feel overlooked by social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics determining a subculture as distinct, may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often sign their membership by recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, affectation and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to mention the few unfortunate cases of children who, as they grew up, were not socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune or malicious mistreatment.
Some children who became wild were imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases such abandonment of a child was due to the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability of a child by the parents.
Children who became savage could experience severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others were said to have been bred by animals; some were said to have lived in nature by themselves.
Raised only by nonhuman animals, the savage child displays behaviors (within the framework of physical limitations) almost entirely similar to those of the certain caregiver animal, as well as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scalping is not a learning method, but a tool that provides support to individuals within a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, and teacher is a variant of scaffolding and the little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
A virtual scaffold is built into software and must ask, suggest and explain procedures that might be difficult for the learner to do on his own.
Children find themselves in a custodial institution for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not supportive, caring and educational, and yet it happens.
We see the guardianship system as a safety zone for these kids.
Our guardianship system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The custody must supply all that is necessary, which they lacked in the house from which they were previously taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The special features of the Internet add dimensions to the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "sustained relationships" as new motivational aspects when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to major breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is especially claimed that it is possible to guess whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech pointed out that people who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and represented.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the range of visible variation.
Dissociation and recombination remix the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy its needs for amino acids from available plants.
And what's more, failure to do so has serious consequences: slower growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest sources of crop resources to get would be proteins that we get from leaves and beans, but those are hard to digest for primates like us if they're not cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide high-quality proteins, which contain the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep apnea is the process of intentionally waking up during your usual sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to regain consciousness without fully waking up.
If you notice that you're resetting the clock while you're sleeping, it can be left on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to turn it off.
Among other biorhythm-based options is drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which will make you get up to urinate.
The extent of inner peace a person has is negatively correlated with the extent of tension in body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive force there is in life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle on the way to that goal is your own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the divine yoga. By visualizing various deities, one cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates the enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. After the war, a clash of systems, processes and cultures caused the countries to split.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years and have real battles, with replacement armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 the Polish defence was already broken, the only hope remaining was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time impeding your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The most notable recent example is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mostly U-boats, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began breeding them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and furs.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in flocks wandering on hills and other pastures, often cared for by goat herders, who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These breeding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although train tracks consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Scaffolds appeared early enough to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it became clear that tracks would be more efficient if they had a iron stripe on top.
This became a popular practice, but iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out more quickly.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The earliest known form of transportation was walking, people began walking vertically two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk vertically as often.
Dupied specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecines from 4,2-3,9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropes are believed to have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to minimize future suffering to some degree.
It's like taking anti-symptomatic medication in many cases. But if we want more than a temporary solution, then we have to find the root cause of the problems and we have to deactivate them.
Of course, the world has been greatly changed by the scientific and technological achievements of mankind, and the problems have been made greater by overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of mankind.
After the Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten bill signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant, a few blocks away.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap's Posters".
The first public reading of the document was delivered by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap posters known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and nails, they lay eggs and they walk on their two back legs, like a tyrannosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, using computer slang.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of a drug or a toxic household chemical.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term derives from a long-standing familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Rabocytes and litosymites are both nidicular, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
Across the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests, or their child's best interests.
Such couples may choose to plan an adoption for their baby.
During an adoption procedure, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to understand through the scientific method how the world works. That method actually guides most scientific research.
But it's not alone; it's also an experiment, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, and questioning and observation guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all subjects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became apparently separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend critically on the presence of endogenous cycles and how the biological clock produces them.
Periodic rhythms, which do not simply respond to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-contained oscillators that continue a period of repeated independent operation even without external stimuli.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, either marking the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a spectrum of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the severity of the wrapped piece of genetic material and whether the wrapped cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in the cells of a germ line can pass to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the sights, including flora and fauna of the living nature.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit Borneo and take pictures and learn about orangutans.
Every morning people leave small towns by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others who are heading to the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuting everyone is somehow involved and contributing to a transport system based on the use of private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere from one of its stable states that has been supporting human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, we rarely hear a similar level of complaints about water quality or about collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems handle these kinds of complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you cannot predict a driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly uniform setup; thus traffic flows tend to have some moderate uniformity and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, develop and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the length of their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places against predators.
Today the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are libels and ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That made sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long and collects water from several thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one ever managed to surpass the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and technical skill in their construction.
The Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its laws and official relations.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements - such as gold, silver and copper - since ancient times because these are found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he further theorized that they would become new substances to form what we see.
An alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could slide into a point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good help for a lot of people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil has fallen out of favor and use has declined.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new comes out.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a slope, so splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the hidden side.
It's less thick under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more seas on the near side, because the crust is less thick. It was easier for lava to spill out onto the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people act or challenges them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalised during maturation into adulthood.
These theories explore what is about certain people, what makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Theory of Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former peers. One edge of the spectrum is the effort to remain one of the friends.
This type of manager is difficult to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, evaluate work efficiency, assign tasks and demand responsibility from people.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done before and take it into their own hands.
After all, in the end, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often this behavior results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high-quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may be misunderstood by their local managers.
The presence of a real Invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal for putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently throughout the functioning departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as of shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to researching cognition, so it narrows the scope and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior has led scientists to continue research.
It's a long-known fact that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and change a number of mental functions.
The progress of new technologies has made it possible to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction undertone, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and also handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, it is also incorporated into some home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are an important part of any teaching. Quite often a teacher would like to take his students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art, sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is another great way to think about travel and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year a new version of the website comes out, but the old versions remain available to use as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing skills in students.While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical of audiences, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "makes students more understanding of the world around them". The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is an instrument that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable learners to become more analytical and critical; by actively reacting to online materials, learners can define their positions in the context of others' writing and also outline their own viewpoint on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a charming bilingual capital of Canada and it has a wealth of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
These and more things highlight Ontario as what outsiders think is essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated, some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
This comparison of populations surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens combined.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is incomparably the largest and, in terms of fauna, it is an independent continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or attached to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and it took root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama initiated the Kabbalah from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say that they are married, regardless of whether they are actually married.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what you might consider to be harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, held in the arm, etc.
Be firm when you disagree with men's proposals and don't be afraid to back down (whether cultural or not, a difference is not necessarily to be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by Phoenicians, Romans and Benemerites as a strategic port with the name Anfa.
Destroyed by the Portuguese, it was rebuilt by them under the name Casa Branca, but they left after the earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco under the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is among the least interesting places in all of Morocco.
Around the old town centre it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tachin, ceramics, leather goods, nargils and a whole range of glitter, but all are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east next to Rwanda.
In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma, covering most of the city's streets, mainly in the city center, with its magma.
Goma offers adequate security, but one must check out every visit outside it to know the status of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano in addition to the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to drive through Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
In addition to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu became a bored metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today Timbuktu is a poor city, but it is a tourist attraction because of its reputation and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was inscribed on the Red List of World Heritage Sites because of the threat of sand from the desert.
It was one of the main stops on the PBS special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in north-eastern South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe and south to the Crocrodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which supports a different fauna.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the most symbolic of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation entrance exhibitions for the park.
It is also useful to buy a Wild Card, which provides entry, either to selected parks of South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and it is the place that many tourists consider the most interesting.
The line of buildings that forms the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering histogram, which is evident from the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross over to the front, which is located on the coast of Kowloon.
The vast majority of urban growth on Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on land reclaimed from the sea on the northern coast.
This is the area that the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest enclosed marine mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) across the coast further into Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest in the Indian territory is given the name Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just a mangrove swamp, however. It contains some of the last refugees of the impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or marshes.
In 1966 the Sundarbans became a reserve and it is estimated that on its territory there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 sighted deer.
Buses leave from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river) all day, but most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading west and to Jakar or Bumthang.
Since interurban buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
The majority of the districts are connected by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Public taxis are fast and comfortable means of transport to nearby places such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres wide and have two corridors of 3,50 metres wide.
The vertical under the bridge is 15 metres wide. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when the planned Brazilian customs crossings will be completed.
The Guarani were the most notable indigenous group living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, living as quasi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the home of other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived off hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was created as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since then, when Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields at Las Cañitas.
Here you can also watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Stay informed at the Asociación Argentina de Polo about tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value has been equalized with that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be changed in the only bank on the islands, which is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
All over the islands, British pounds are generally accepted and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
On the outer islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but you can take British and American money; ask in advance to know which payment method is accepted.
Since it is almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, change the money before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer, while in the northern hemisphere it has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed 30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely freeze, but wind and humidity combine and you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no separate rainy and dry seasons: the rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals have gotten used to the presence of humans, the animals are still wild and one should not feed or disturb them.
The park authorities ask that everyone stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they look, the bison, elk, deer, bears and almost all other big animals are capable of attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept a proper distance. Because these animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, guard their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep the campground clean.
The city of Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and is home to just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the scene of the infamous naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting at the town led to the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland has many beaches thanks to its location between two ports. The most popular are in three regions.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are at the Waitemata Harbour in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with shops lining up along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One. It's not a complex beer, but it's delicious and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many wines worth drinking from France, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be better.
It's perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but bottled water is easy to find if you're worried.
The idea of flat white coffee is foreign to Australians. The expression is short black, cappuccino is rich in cream (not sponge) and the tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standard. The juices are expensive but delicious.
Throughout the year there are many excursions to the reef and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Kubozoos appear near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks are, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and they'd swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the sea. Their main habitat is estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but you may be able to book through such agents other types of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agents generally offer plans that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even combined plans with flights and hotels.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to provide you with other documents for the destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests must, however, be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees decide to camp out on the spot and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to camp out next to the music.
Remember that music on the main stages may have stopped, but there may be parts of the festival where it will be playing until late at night.
Some festivals provide special campsites for families with small children.
If you're going to sail the northern Baltic in winter, be careful about the location of the cabin, because going through ice causes quite a terrible noise in those most affected.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Passengers on cruise ships are visa-free (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to ensure that guests spend the maximum amount of their time and money. Windows and clocks are usually not there and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special meals, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them inside.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness damages mental capacity and every good athlete is aware of how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who drives a vehicle in high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice or frost.
On roads with ice or snow, friction is minimal and therefore one cannot drive as if on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, the amount of snow that can block you can fall very quickly.
Visibility can also be limited by snow falling or wind, condensation, ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, freezing and snowing weather is normal in many countries, but traffic flows mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the most attractive tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The word safari is popularly used to mean a land trip to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and ordinary tools allow for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards sometimes seem timid, so binoculars will help you see them better.
A walking safari (also called a camp march, marsh safari, or walking) consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021 with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Having hosted the 1964 Games, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked the flights and accommodations for 2020, before the delay was announced, you are probably in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but, in the case of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, and typical tickets will cost around 7,000 yen.
Polishing wet clothes can help keep them dry. Many hotels have borrowable ironing boards and slats, even if they are not in the room.
If no iron is available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you may want to try using a dryers, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may shrink it or, in extreme cases, cause a burn in it).
There are different ways to purify water, but some are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, you can boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different efficiencies, and if you care about this, consider buying the water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unknown in their home regions.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation or, worst of all, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons or carry infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals capable of injuring or killing a person by force are generally not counted as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, sometimes passing through isolated forested areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be very careful: there are steep slopes, narrow corridors, and winding roads.
Signal speed limits are significantly lower than those of front and rear sections  often 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and they are strictly adhered to, even more so than otherwise.
It is noteworthy that mobile phone service is nonetheless much stronger here than in many other sections of the road, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very tasty and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of its neighbour in the south, Austria.
There are many fruit pastries that contain apples all year round, and cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts. Popular pastries usually go especially well with a cup of intense coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try the ones called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a food consisting of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Candy can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is usually added to curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a vast term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without additional qualifying words, the term generally refers to the cuisine originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now readily available throughout the archipelago, the Java cuisine offers a variety of spicy foods, with the flavours favored by Javanese, namely peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Hanging from both sides of the saddle, the footings act as supports at the rider's feet.
They provide the rider with greater stability, but they can present safety problems because the rider's feet might eventually get caught in them.
If, while riding, you fall off a horse with the foot caught in a kick, you could be dragged by a possibly fleeing horse. To minimize this risk, you can take various safety measures.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth, fairly narrow heel and sole.
Additionally, some saddles, mostly English saddles, have safety bars such that a falling rider can pull them back to unhook a foot belt from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing site in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer amazing vistas. Climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new paths out of the walls' endless possibilities.
Down-slope winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which one slides down a snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, who are known as Hskia maniacs and who plan entire holidays based on skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downskiing has been considered a sport since at least the 17th century and in 1861 Norwegians founded Australia's first pleasure ski club.
Skiing: This activity is also called skiing, skiing or ski hiking.
It refers to alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but it usually does not involve them, since the latter take place on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as if it were a hiking trail.
Under good conditions you can cover slightly longer distances than on foot, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of skiing without a heavy backpack on well-maintained roads.
Europe is a relatively small part of the world, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, to travel through several countries you need to complete visa requests and passport checks again.
The Schengen area, however, operates in this regard as if it were one country.
Provided that you stay within this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply separately for a visa to every Schengen country, which saves you time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what goods are antiques. Some tax authorities consider as antiques those goods that are over 100 years old.
Because the definition varies by location, in places like North America, the average age may be lower than in Europe.
One could consider handicraft objects as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Boazing is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture around its trade is important also for many other artisans.
Even in tradition, not all the Sami were engaged in large-scale breeding of boaceans, but they lived by fishing, hunting or something like that, using boaces mainly as draught animals.
Today many Sami people work in modern jobs. Tourism offers important income to Samoa, the Sami region.
Although the word Gypsy is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about Roma.
If a travel warning is issued against the country you are visiting, it may affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
It is also a good idea to consult the advice of foreign governments, even if they are directed to their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
A warning is just a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and too simple compared to the more detailed information that one can have elsewhere.
Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon capable of causing damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and it consists of different types, which depend on the location, the terrain and the atmospheric conditions.
Wind gusts, hail, excessive precipitation and forest fires are the manifestations and effects of severe weather, in addition to thunderstorms, tornadoes, thunderstorms and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather are blizzards, snowstorms, winter storms and sandstorms.
It is highly advisable that travelers be aware of any type of risk of severe weather that affects their area, as this can affect any travel plans.
Every visitor to a country that could be counted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An online search for a course for hostile media will most likely show the address of a local company.
A course will generally cover all the issues presented here in much more detail, normally with practical experience.
One course will normally last 2 to 5 days and will include roles, a lot of rescue and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines about survival in the wild, but there are few such works about war zones.
Travelers who plan a sex-change operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness to issue passports without a gender (X) or updated documents corresponding to a desired name varies from government to government.
Whether foreign governments are willing to accept these kinds of documents also varies greatly.
Security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period after 9/11.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not wait to pass the scans without their privacy and dignity being intact.
Surfing is the backward flow of waves that have broken at a beach, often at a reef or similar location.
Due to the various underwater formations, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections where a rapid flow to depth can occur.
Most of these deaths are caused by trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you swim out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to find a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills or whether you've been spotted, you might prefer to wait until you're rescued.
The return shock occurs earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have particular difficulty in re-adapting to their native culture.
By returning home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some habits of the native culture.
When you first travel abroad, people probably have patience and understanding, because they know that travelers need to adjust to the new country.
People may not foresee that patience and understanding are also needed with regard to the travelers returning home.
The pyramidal show of sound and light is one of the most interesting things for children in the region.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Here you will generally hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The interplay of sound and light is just like a novel.
The Sphinx is placed on the background and it is the narrator of a long story.
They project the scenes on the pyramids and they light up the different pyramids.
Discovered in 1819, the South Shetland Islands are claimed by a number of countries and have the most bases, 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, on which is the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island and Deception, whose flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a striking natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
After joining with the plateau here, the mountain range of the peninsula later reappears forming the Ellsworth Range, which is 360 kilometres long and is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel mountain range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson massif, whose highest peak is Vinson at 4,892 m (14,070 ft).
In remote areas without access to a mobile network, a satellite phone may be the only resource.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you have to be outdoors with a clear view of a satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider may also inform you about the connection to this service.
For those who plan a sabbatical, it is increasingly popular to travel and study.
This is especially popular among those who finish secondary school, because it gives them a year off before going to university, without risking their education.
In many cases, if you take a sabbatical course abroad, it can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education when you return home.
Normally there will be a membership fee to join these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and on the lakes one does not necessarily need a yacht.
While the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for any type of yacht, smaller boats and even a kayak give a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland: one in seven or eight Finns owns a boat.
Such popularity is only seen in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. But it is a rather unique statistic (for example, in the Netherlands one in forty people own a boat).
The majority of the various Baltic cruise ships also include a stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can fully use a few days to visit the historic city, returning at night on the ship to sleep there.
If one disembarks only on the cruise excursions, a separate visa is not necessary (since 2009).
The brochures of some cruise ships include Berlin, Germany. As can be seen at the top of the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience regardless of age and background, especially if you've never flown or if you've been through a traumatic experience.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes related to others that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear that is based on not knowing or not being in control.
Courier companies make good money for quick delivery of goods. Often time is very important for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some lines, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but there was a problem on other lines and smaller companies.
If they sent goods by freight plane, on some routes they could spend several days in the discharge and customs.
The only way to do this faster was to send things as registered packages. According to airline regulations, you cannot send a package without a passenger associated, and here you are, seizing the opportunity.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a very large ticket package for the privilege (or, even better, your company does it for you).
However, it's not cheap: on a rough estimate, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy class fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
Generally, it's not worth the trouble of looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of air travelers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably, and they pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were restored between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations failed.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and vibrant commercial center, located by a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
Between the wide boulevards, the buildings with glass facades and the modern business centers, traditional red-brick roofs, 18th-century bazaars and old mosques and churches stand out, but the atmosphere of the city is more Mediterranean than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the adjacent island of Eysturoy and on it is an unusual octagonal church.
On some tombs in the church courtyard are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through the intriguing village.
To the north and easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners when Lord Byron reported its grand merits in praise.
The 403 bus line from Scotturb regularly runs to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), which is the site of world-famous apparitions of Mary.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass cemetery and also a place with an almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived their past here and there are still many people who had loved ones who were killed or forced to work to death there, whether Jews or not.
Please behave in the place with as much dignity, solemnity and respect as it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the site with marks or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
But most posters are only in Catalan, because the law declared it the first official language.
In any case, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
In the metro, the regular announcements are made only in Catalan, but the unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have gained a reputation as self-centered, unkind and arrogant people.
This is often just an inaccurate stereotype, but the best way to keep smooth relations with Parisians is best to behave as if you were bien élevé (well educated). This will make the journey much easier.
The abrupt manners of Parisians will quickly evaporate if one shows basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park has abundant forests, mainly of beech, pines and firs, and it presents a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The diversity of vegetarian communities is remarkably high due to the variety of microclimates, diverse terrains and different altitudes.
The region is also home to an extremely diverse variety of animal and bird species.
There one can find rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and urogals, in addition to many more common species.
During a visit to the monasteries, women must wear skirts up to the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do supply laundry to women who arrive unprepared, but the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you if you bring your own laundry, especially if it is light-colored.
Similarly, men should wear knee-length pants.
You can also borrow this one from the storage room at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed after each use, and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. There is one size for all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like those of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and it uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially in the summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available additives, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Every noun, in addition to the word Sie with the meaning you, always begins with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs and objects.
It probably makes reading easier too, but writing gets a little more complicated because you need to know whether a verb or an adjective is used in the substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced correctly according to how they are written.
The main letters worth noting are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the subsequent vowel.
Furthermore, r and rr must be pronounced differently: tsar means dear, while carro means chariot.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively easy and regular in most cases.
So reading this grammar introduction would help you learn a lot of Persian grammar and understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if one speaks a Romance language, it will make it easier to learn Portuguese.
But still, people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so close that it is not worth learning it separately.
In general, pre-modern observatories are obsolete today and they remain as museums or educational centers.
Because then light pollution wasn't as much of a problem as it is today, they're usually located in cities or at universities, places that are more accessible than the ones built in modern times.
The most modern telescopes for exploration are huge installations in remote locations under favorable atmospheric conditions.
Looking at cherry blossoms, also known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the prune flower was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other aristocrats around the imperial court.
Because plants look best in the wild, don't give in to the temptation to remove specimens, not even one.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting specimens will also cause you to be expelled without question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to explore. Once you get there, you can buy almost anything.
But still, since you'll be in the High Tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to fight the heat (always) and the strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the patriarchs from the Bible Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base your holidays on.
This would allow, for example, to visit castles in the Lauerval or the Rhine, or to go by cruise to interesting towns on the Danube or by boat along the Erie Canal.
They also specify routes of known hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is among the most important holidays of Christianity. It celebrates the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers living in Christian countries or elsewhere around the world have adopted many of the traditions of this holiday.
Traditionally, one spends the Easter night awake in an open space to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
On the Sabbath night of the Easter weekend, more traditional churches often hold a Easter vigil and the parishioners begin celebrating Christ's resurrection at exactly midnight.
All the animals that first arrived on the archipelago came either swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the long distance between the islands and the mainland, mammals could not make such a journey and therefore the giant tortoise became the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since their arrival, humans have introduced many mammals to the Galapagos, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience a polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good chance of seeing the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark almost always.
You can also enjoy the stars, because these regions are sparsely populated and light pollution is usually not a problem.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Costumes are the normal workwear and co-workers address each other by surnames or job titles.
Workplace harmony is paramount, as is emphasis on group effort rather than praise of individual achievements.
Workers usually have to get their bosses' approval for all decisions they make and they have to follow the instructions without question.
