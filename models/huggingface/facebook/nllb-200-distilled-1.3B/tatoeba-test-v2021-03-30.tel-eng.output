He's our boy.
I'll start swimming very soon.
How are you coming?
Sin cried.
What were you talking about?
Mary bought a new dress for the party.
Lalita called.
My father sleeps with a telescope.
He is no longer near the house.
He had two pencils, one long and one short.
The elderly walk slowly
Ah! How beautiful is the Taj Mahal!
We didn't sleep for days.
Ram came to the school.
He touched me.
He is Ram.
Tom washed his hands of the lust.
Oh, my God!
Of course
Are you okay?
I realized that you are my brother.
Emmitt! Is this true?
When will Sita go?
It's not that easy, you know.
What's in the box?
Is there any good water there?
This plant has some burnt leaves
Emmitt! Is this true?
The station is nearby
Tom washed his glasses with hot soapy water and rubbed them on the cloth.
Do you tiffany before you're seven?
Did all this really happen?
The boy is a little monster.
It is clear that there is no other way
Sita smiled beautifully.
Did you do your homework?
Some dogs survive
There are islands in the sea.
Have you eaten?
He teaches Spanish to children
What time do I have to get to the station?
Happy International Women's Day! The day is marked by the celebration of the International Women's Day.
Where did you put my book?
She has been teaching music for thirty years.
He made a bookshelf for her.
Mary was devastated when she heard Tom say that.
There is nothing to fear.
Today is not over yet.
She refused to say anything more.
We want to hear
Are you still afraid of what might happen?
I was very hurt.
I should have been able to do it all by myself.
The nearest bus stop is somewhere.
Who did not come?
What's your room number?
When will you come back?
As far as I know, he is not married yet.
We don't understand French.
Sin cried out loud.
Have you ever been to Paris?
He had no children.
We must get rid of him.
My bag is nowhere to be seen.
They sing a song.
You seem very happy.
We should hire trustworthy ones
Why didn't you make it.
Show me where it hurts.
Give this book to Ram.
The caterpillar cries for milk
I know you'll tell me no.
These pencils are the same color
I'll be very careful.
I ran home.
Did you do your homework?
That is a very stupid question.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
What color do you like, blue or purple?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
She sits on the table.
We were playing tennis there.
I don't believe him
I don't like coffee.
Shall we go out to eat tonight?
Ram has arrived.
What good is it to call them that?
What did you talk about.
Are you okay?
Oh, my God!
Stay where you are.
Do you live around here?
What are you doing tomorrow, Tom?
We played basketball yesterday.
Give it to Ram.
Sita smiled.
I've never been to Japan.
They are animals.
How many mangoes do you want?
What time is it now?
I don't know where they are.
He put it
Are you okay?
Thank you for welcoming me.
It is difficult to speak English well
I'm really sorry about last night.
I wouldn't go there today if I were you.
We did it on purpose.
Oh, Raju fell down the stairs!
These socks don't stick when washed.
She's not a doctor.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
He was clothed like a woman.
How did you put this doll?
There is nothing left.
Children love cake
The game is meaningless.
You came so soon.
Bananas are delicious.
Let us take that opportunity.
Bring some tea.
How much is the book?
Come, I'll give you some too
I can't keep you here much longer.
You need to speak up.
I'll leave this time.
I don't need anything.
How many mangoes do you want?
How tall is she?
It hit me.
What do you take?
It was while I was eating a banana.
It's not a sentence.
Mary had lied to you, but she didn't tell you.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
She was terrified.
Sitting all day is not good for you
Let him stay there.
Did you do your homework?
How are you?
What's your pen?
What a surprise!
The steam scared the cat away.
The movie is about to begin.
Is that true?
Why did you call me?
What is the meaning of the name "rose"?
When will you come from Vijayawada?
You can do it.
People believe that God exists.
I made a mistake, even if it wasn't my intention.
I am learning Burmese.
You can eat lunch here in this room.
Do not hesitate to ask me for help.
It's time to leave for school, isn't it?
It's not all your fault.
I'm hungry again.
My father is not at home right now.
Ram came to the school.
Is Lata here?
I make mistakes too.
Mary's boyfriend threatened to leave her.
That's a party.
Tom was very scared.
Did you do your homework?
I have a headache.
Music speaks where words cannot.
Is the work done?
Emmitt! Is this true?
How long has it been?
I don't know who won.
Beyond sight, beyond the mind.
I thought it was useless.
I'll get off at the next stop.
Is it really that bad?
I'm not allowed to do that here.
What time is it now?
How is the stomach?
I started talking.
Mary bought a fake purse.
She was on her way to school.
The next morning, the family was in the kitchen.
I'm not the only one to blame.
Do you know why he's so angry?
It sounds very interesting.
Is it Chinese or Japanese? Is it Korean?
It is better to leave him alone
Help came too late
Is that true?
You don't have to be ashamed.
Go there.
What are you saying?
Is the work I said done?
Don't interfere with my work.
Two birds with one stone
This is education.
Is there anything else to say about that?
The error
She was breathing cold air.
It is very valuable.
Did you do your homework yesterday?
What else do I have to lose?
Are you mad?
You'll understand when you're my dad.
The game is not only a great cowboy but also a good doctor
Tell me about your daily life.
You can go swimming or fishing.
My computer is expensive.
Where is Mary?
He earns three times as much as I do.
I never saw him.
Are you willing to do this?
Are you okay?
How are you?
Go there tomorrow!
I usually do that.
Lata came from school?
Why can't giraffes sing?
How quiet this temple is!
I know he's coming.
It's not my fault.
The work is almost done.
I heard you were sick.
Why did you lie to her?
It's not that easy.
You are fat.
A cat came out from under the desk.
Get some tea now!
I don't have time to talk right now.
I don't speak Japanese.
Brush your teeth daily
When did you stop smoking?
The steam has long arms and legs
It's an evening study.
He asked how many languages I spoke.
I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
And he washed his hands of the blood .
You must come once.
Did you see that?
Have you ever had a heart attack?
We need money to do what we want to do.
I do not agree.
Who are we?
I heard the bell ring.
Can I use your phone?
Shabaash! The doll is good!
Where's your boy?
Only animal products contain fat.
Please don't give me any more coffee.
My advice to you is to do that.
It's an evening study.
He did not keep his word
Is it a red rose?
Did you do your homework?
She answered the door as her heart beat.
Is that right?
Lalita has invited me to the wedding.
It may take all afternoon or longer
He took revenge
Shabhash, you put this toy well!
I drank coffee.
How are you?
