Parliament has not ratified the amendment to free Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, as part of a criminal law amendment, a proposal to cancel the paragraph on the indictment of opposition leader Julia Tymosenko.
MEPs rejected the amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the door to freedom for the former Prime Minister, now imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for entering into a supposedly disadvantageous deal with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not final and the court is expected to rule on the convict's appeal in December.
Tymosenko calls the verdict political revenge by the regime and has provoked a process of suspicion of bias by the court also in the West.
The bill to repeal Section 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to pass.
The Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already had its defeats.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the Islamists are the winners of the elections, whether they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary law of Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya is becoming a crime-free country because you cut off your hand for stealing.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible disrespect of the faith is punishable by death penalty...
It is the Koran that will unite the society of opposing tribes instead of the personality of the dictator.
In Libya there will be an order we cannot imagine and certainly would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly striking that the Islamic warriors gratefully accepted the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it wasn't an American general who was leading the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We have participated in the shootings, served Islam and our politicians have turned their backs on the dictator as a political ally without any benefit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
So there's no problem for the locals to get rid of the crusaders.
Without the land occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
As long as those Sharia-followers keep us from it.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A statistical tornado hit Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states has published GDP information for 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only looking to Italy, but also to Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their economic development forecasts for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
Both countries revised the data for the second quarter, in which Germany performed better than expected (up 0.3% from 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original report was about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading for a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts predicted.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to forecasts and periodically recalculated data.
The euro area and European Union economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which was in line with analysts' forecasts.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on 10-year bonds is 28.45%
The yields on Spanish and Italian bonds are rising to critical limits.
The problems are starting to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation in the region worsens.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort .
The Czechs have qualified for EURO.
They beat Montenegro 1-0 and celebrate qualifying for 200 million
The football team has completed its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has defended its qualification with great success in the second half and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first half and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech team also won thanks to super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with a 1-0 win over Montenegro and celebrates its qualification to the European Championship.
The Montenegrin team was under pressure until the second half because of a precise Czech defense.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to super Petr Cech, the Czech team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a 200 million crown prize in the Czech football fund.
From the first few minutes, we played war football.
Both teams had difficulty putting together a suit and the game was mainly centered around the center line.
The pressure from the national players failed to break through the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even in the first half.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began praying at noon outside the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from Isfahan universities created a human shield on Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is processed.
They have thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its latest report that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear arsenal.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began praying at noon outside the site and then wished for the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to destroy Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Isfahan but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: not eating breakfast and eating meat for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This again shows how important the environment and the patterns that surround us are.
For example, the number of meals on the tables of obese children is 50 percent higher than in families with normal-weight children.
19% of obese people had French fries for dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In families with small children, sports are also not a habit, as is now the case with most schoolchildren today - only 15% said that at least once a week parents found time for active exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out during the last school year and involved 900 pupils in primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", a campaign supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since its inception, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have signed up for this project.
One of the key factors in the dramatic increase in the number of overweight and obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed say they eat breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinners five times a day, which is a basic principle of good nutrition", says one survey report.
No breakfast and no meatballs for dinner .
Experts point out that healthy development requires a few basic things, such as having breakfast at the same time as a family.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school families eat at the same time.
In most families, each family member eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that's been found is that one-tenth of the population doesn't eat breakfast at all.
However, breakfast is the basis of a healthy daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families with obese children tend to eat unhealthy fries.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
Over 40% of the children surveyed play sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Get your food ready.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own meals from options offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating".
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is the high preference for sugary lemonades", says the survey.
For lunch, pasta took first place right before white meat.
The children did not want starchy food at all and preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Aim for health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
"A follow-up of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the 'Obesity is not a coincidence' awareness-raising session showed a strong desire to move towards a healthy diet", the survey results state.
The most striking example was the sugary lemonade, where children began to prefer drinking water.
The children most often ticked the questionnaire for white meat and fish as the main course and would cut down on sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread-meal balls or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article about how to teach stylists, I got a little bit angry that there were so many of them from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three experts in the field, the costumes of the characters and a seminar on what happens on the spot.
And it's going to get worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "drunk".
This time we had with the principal Alenka (in the class there is no boy) dealt with how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, no curve, another overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually reduce the width of the arms, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We've managed to emphasize the character nicely and also not dress too conspicuously for the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with strong breasts and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between waist and hips so that skirts or pants do not fit at all, it is worth getting custom made.
And you won't regret it because the clothes that fall off flawlessly are priceless.
A tailored skirt will make you feel much better than one that's always sliding, curling up and not holding the belt and so on.
For those who look masculine, they can afford Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabric, or embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I am glad that I have the whole week to sort through all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that with what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each intern was given a celebrity to dress up for the day and evening.
We must consider the current appearance, the type of personality and the fashion.
I'm gonna have to dress up Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Deep down, I'm glad, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who's gained almost 100 pounds lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work on the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say about the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
It is also important to consider the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist does not only dress the body but also creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, told us about it.
But that... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the special gave a diverse look to Saturday's session filled with information on different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, the stylist, Jakub Polanka, the fashion designer and Ben Renc, the fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist can work with a single garment in different ways.
Variability is paramount in this example.
For example, this trench coat that must be worn in a classic way with jeans and a T-shirt as a light coat but also he can also dress the naked body, with scarves and take a photo of it as a dress.
Or you can just pull up the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it", he pointed out.
But I especially appreciated the advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start to break it", Jakub said.
I finally understand why we struggle to learn these rules, what to do with them, to what, why, when in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on the fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have a lot more variations of clothing than the ones being photographed.
I mean, for a fashion story that has ten pages (so ten models) I have to be ready to "retail" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements looks completely different from reality.
We have to take this into account when creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half of success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who's not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using stylists' services remains cold.
And familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (I just know something but what I look like comes second).
And if someone gets a haircut from us, then we have to rely on the fact that he will probably dictate a completely different (smaller) size than what he actually has.
Then we just have to go to Google and see if the news bulletin lists the celebrity in question, whether she's lost weight or gained weight etc...
Honza and Mario told us on Sunday that it is not enough for a stylist to know how to dress and how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he dresses and so it's important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort her closet and fill it with new items you can't just throw it all away and say, 'Oh my God, that's horrible.'"
"You will find some clothes that you find pretty and he will advise you how to wear them", says Mario.
He showed us what the designer's bag should contain.
It's the one you hang around your waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined items such as scissors, hair-removal rollers, and baby-neckles, there are also nylon threads (used by stylists to photograph items such as bags, hats, and so on), special clips to close a garment behind if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple is not usable because it could damage the garment), and a sewing kit.
So that we would not just be people who listen but who tried something practical they taught us how to properly tie shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the studio where the surface is even, the sole could be damaged, especially on the outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors, so we wouldn't accidentally hurt ourselves.
So it really takes skills.
I was delighted when Mario congratulated me on my creation.
The skill I'm describing is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a brief summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes.
I'm beginning to understand more and more that making a career out of styling isn't a walk in a rose garden, whatever you say.
The need for speed is being fought over all over America.
The review
A smooth ride turns into a routine morning commute to work because of a series of stupid mistakes by people who have nothing to do with it.
It fulfils everyone's ambition to some extent but it is of no use if no one wants to do more.
The new installment subtitled The Run generated high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already aging Need for Speed racing series and to bring out a kind of game from the playable parts that would not count only on points.
So we were curious about how the extra passages would be where the main character gets out of his car and does whatever he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole thing is pulling down because of some unnecessary bugs that have already been around for several years.
These are not really errors but rather the expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts off well.
You are caught up in an adventure where the main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them starts racing illegally across America.
You get behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is run on a different route and the stages are planned in different environments which are quite distinct from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game is offering him something identical.
Some environments are also quite nice even if the graphic level is the same as the previous series.
Well, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, through autumn scenery, or through snow-capped mountains is very pleasing to the eye.
The tests are also occasionally supplemented by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert, you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche doesn't fall on you.
Besides, the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a few of them, but that's enough.
One moment you are trying to outrun the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) and then you are running against the clock (a classic clock duel) and then you are facing another duel with an opponent.
Now and then you also have the police coming in and trying to make things difficult for you.
The new feature is the off-vehicle passages.
It's more of an interactive animation where most of the time Jack is running from someone and you have to help him by tapping the right button at the right time.
It's not complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer such moments than you would expect (to be specific there are only three).
The result is just that, because this element is not likely to interfere and is, in the context described above, among the elements that enhance the game.
The driving pattern is in the tradition of the previous games.
Which means that there's nothing out of the ordinary right now, but we can't say it's negative.
As for the realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But although you can find better in competition the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So it's all right.
The problems start to show up after a while.
The driving pattern is different, the collision pattern is not yet developed.
We don't expect this game to have complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it's not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car starts to go into a frenzy.
Or it's going to be in pieces.
Thanks to the reboot system, it's not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you break your face or you step out into the scene the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have five reboots.
When you've used all five reboots you have to start the game all over again.
So it's more of a tool, in case something goes wrong, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes restarting does not help and the solution must be found by recalling the route in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same stocks end up in the same places.
For example, there are certain corners that you have to go through in a certain way or else it doesn't go through.
Otherwise you will always find "civilian" vehicles in the same configuration at a given place, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds early or one minute late.
What's annoying is situations where you see the other car pass easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either pull over and go around them or brake.
It doesn't matter if you go to meet him because it's calculated so that for any given situation he always comes right up to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive at certain places, again without regard to the time, and you always have the same opponent ahead of you in the same place.
It's most annoying at the end of the game when you're driving on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The enemy must pass before you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you, it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you crash into it quite a few times.
You can understand that the goal of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it's clear that you get bored quickly.
And that's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and the places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something.
The original idea was to change cars during races.
You have to be careful at the gas stations on the routes because you can change cars there, but most of the time you can just use the one you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cars for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic outfits on very technical roads, for example on mountain laces.
And the challenge mode, which is racing in particular places that you know of as adventure, goes very well with the main story mode.
You not only receive medals but also experience points that add to your profile which is common to challenges and adventure.
When you reach the highest level of driver, various objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the hardest shots to understand is the situation in the final race of the adventure.
You drive your car into the subway tunnel (this looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (this looks like).
Your speedometer tells you 150 to 200 kilometers per hour (a priori) and behind you comes a subway train that sends your car straight to the scrap yard.
At the editorial office we had a discussion for a few days about whether anyone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really think we are idiots.
The technical part of the game is not great, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What's disturbing is that in more extreme situations, the imagery doesn't keep up and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imaging is no longer useful.
The soundtrack is good and the track is a choice.
In order to appeal to the largest possible number of people, and especially the youngest, a new soundtrack has been created in the style of "I mix everything", but it can be expected that no one will buy the game for the music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game feels like it's not over.
Fun is really nice, but be prepared for mistakes to hit you in the eye with the force of an airfield reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the Charles University Choirs
The Festa Academica festival is offering for the third time festivities that link the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival, 20 choirs from high schools and secondary schools perform.
The festival's highlight is two concerts on 17 November.
"Charles University has a big part in this festival".
"Among the choirs is the Choir of the Faculty of Education and Humanities, and the festival committee is headed by the rector, Vaclav Hampl", says Jakub Calou, head of the organizing team.
The highlight of the festival is the concert of the Choir of High Schools and Secondary Schools, which is held with free admission on 17 November from 2 pm on the space in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The programme includes the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz mass.
In the evening, the concert "Students in Velvet" takes place at the National House in Vinohrady, with choirs from the universities and Charles University.
The aim of the Festa Academica is not only to celebrate with dignity the International Students' Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present the audience with choir music of the highest level and to develop the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organiser is the Czech Cheese Union in cooperation with the Jan Kepler High School.
The whole action is under the auspices of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.

The programme also offers high-level concerts, musical events, student events and other activities.
All information can be found on the festival's website www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the EU:
The Czech Republic is behaving like a negative and Eurosceptic
'The Lisbon Treaty has radically upset the balance between the institutions'
"I didn't expect such a hard war".
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new role", began Miléna Vicenova, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, in her presentation at the Faculty of Law.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way that many lecturers at the Charles University Law School would envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her motto 'understandable and open about Europe'.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, there were criticisms that he was dull, that he was a redneck, that he could not do any task, and I must say that he took everyone's breath away because he played his part perfectly".
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the 27 Member States, communicates well with them and has a clear vision of the direction Europe should take".
She explained the new role of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as an answer to the question: 'Who is who in the European Union?'
No one wants to ban our syrecky.
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda which the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She described the Czech presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs have solved the growing financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation to the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the activity is at its peak" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which is still continuing to resolve itself.
The new budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation, must also be approved.
It seems that the budget will be small and that we will be able to save money, so which sector will have priority, which countries will receive the most or the least aid, all this will be decided in the course of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogan with which she arrived in Brussels: 'For an understandable Europe'.
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels nobody makes round or twisted pickles, bananas of different sizes or that nobody has forbidden us to make syrrecky".
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is ahead
The Czech people have a reputation for being Eurosceptic and for seeing things in their negative rather than positive aspects, according to the Ambassador.
It is also regrettable that the Czech Republic is so little represented in the European institutions.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she also stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Poles, Magyars, Slovaks come to me, the Frenchman says, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?'
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Member States' own resources.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, that prevails over a 'new European federation'.
"We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation".
First, it was said that countries that wanted to cooperate with each other and those that did not want to stay in their own country".
'There will be many such institutes and a truly two-speed Europe,' she expects.
It also welcomed the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye's mission to establish the basis for all issues affecting the EU to be discussed among all EU members and not just eurozone members.
The history of a brand:
IBM, the innovator, enters its second century
If someone were to look for the word that best expresses IBM strategy, the closest one would be "long term".
For a broad public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left behind the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
Its slogan "THINK!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant would develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the basis of the corporate care culture developed by Watson.
For us IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years because it has always remained true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
It has allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more", said the firm's current director, Samuel J. Palmisano, on the occasion of the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to care for his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacation, employer-paid insurance plus a stylish employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and commercials.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was originally great at talent discovery - as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus had a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who is expected to replace Palmisano as head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what's called jamy, online brainstorming, which has led to many future strategies and innovations.
It's no wonder he has a lot of ideas - the firm has almost 500,000 people working.
An Institution with a Good Name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures its secure position in the business world.
"From the beginning IBM was more of an institution than a technology firm", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology", added Geogre Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue", as it is known in the United States because of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services from server products to nanotechnology.
It has many of the patents of all American technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are the cash machine, the credit card, the financial swap, the barcode, and the floppy disk.
IBM has this year, with $220 billion, become the second largest technology firm by market capitalization (first is Apple), when it first overtook Microsoft in 1996.
Preview of the project
Not all innovations and manufactures were preferred by the customer and the time - IBM for example failed to bet on a proprietary OS/2 operating system, the Prodige online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"Once your business is built on moving forward you cannot emotionally cling to the past", observes Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its foundation on many platforms and when they don't work it leaves.
Unlike, for example, competitor Microsoft, which is based on and remains on the Windows operating system.
A technology with a future
In IBM's revenue, services, which are made up of one fifth by software and hardware, have a leading place.
However, even in 1990 it was with more than the strongest hardware representative.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold $15 billion of low-yielding assets, and during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM is trading according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression also increased his volume of investments.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without worry?
IBM's stock price has skyrocketed since 2008 by 120 percent, and the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but its values.
It is therefore to be expected that this flexible giant will be able to cope with other crises.
The history of IBM: from slices of cheese to space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, originally under the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially a trademark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s.
They had technology such as the old "pointers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the firm's founder - Watson's ideas are still the basis of the company's identity and culture.
Watson took over the Kusqu's firm in 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, started with the production of every machine possible for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales multiplied to $9 million and the firm began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable to the firm that after 40 years as head of the firm his son Thomas Watson Jr. took over as chairman.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM people and computers helped NASA guide spaceflight -- to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 to the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that set the standard for computers at the time, the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to deal in consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that's been successful at IBM for the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
The aim is to make intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
In the area of commerce, IBM has recently developed a 'Smarter Commerce' platform that helps salespeople manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It opened its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at the time.
Today, besides IBM RT, there is also the Brno strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central and Eastern European Centre is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team for speech recognition.
Ryshtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep this donkey. I don't want any more!
Darina Ryshtarova (53) said, it is over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became her bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his rosy dream and return home.
Only she couldn't wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner", explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova took Bartosova into her home in the summer, she had no idea that their marriage would not last.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not reject the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
In time, Darina gave up, accepted her husband's affair, and finally said goodbye to him forever.
Ryshtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him at the door of the house.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will kick him out".
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship", Rychtarova let it slip, showing that she has separated from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina locked the door for him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change".
"My wife set up a marriage on paper and I respect that".
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy".
"We talk with Darina in a completely normal way but we don't have sex", Rychtar told Blesk.
If Ryshtarova finds a new love he won't stop her.
"We don't have sex and I don't care where she goes, who she's with, or if she's having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility", Joseph concluded.
The Worst Vices of Women - Do They Affect You?
If you ask men to identify the typical vices of women, all of them are equally capable of pulling them out of their sleeves.
Ladies, in the following lines you will learn about the female vices that can pump blood from men's veins.
Shopping
Does your partner ever tell you that you're a shopaholic?
Do you have to buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and pack at the time of sales?
In your case, you could call shopping a vice.
Some women feel that they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you may say, which would resist going to the window-dressing shop, looking for yourself some nice clothes and then trying them all on in the booth (the ideal of different colors)?
And while for most women shopping is a hobby, it can be a real hell for men.
Just think how many times you've told your spouse that he's waiting outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I need to lose at least 10 pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me?"
Do these phrases ring a bell?
- You did?
So you're one of those women who's obsessed with how they look.
It's not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to their partner always complaining about her appearance.
The stronger sex is not afraid to say that the more frequent these complaints are, the more women become toxic.
Cleanliness and smell first
It's like an endless ride.
Washing windows, vacuuming, cleaning floors, dusting, and cleaning the bathroom - twice a week.
You tell your partner that he walks dirty on the clean floor, tell the kids that they've dirtied the sink, smeared the living room window, and that it's giving you a lot of work?
If you are suffering from this particular obsession, try to remember that nothing should be overdoing it and that order and cleanliness should not be the priority in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can ruin relationships and even family peace.
The work of undermining
"Put that worn-out sweater in the trash".
"Are you going to wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has no place on the floor".
If you do this undermining job on your partner several times a day, you're really going to break him down.
It's obvious you don't mean any harm. You want everything to be flawless.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have to do so much underground work...
Slander and slander
Slander, harassment and even insults are also common among some women.
Women are particularly interested in relationships and are therefore happy to discuss such topics as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a little harmless sniffle here and there.
Hand on heart is a woman's thing.
But the worst are those who advise, abuse, even despise others and are particularly dangerous to those around them - especially at work in a collective of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped by helping Philadelphia win.
Hockey forward Jagr was a two-time participant in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL game on the ice in Carolina and is again leading the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the perspective of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the game's MVP, he scored both times.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr told reporters from across the Atlantic after the game that he had warned Giroux it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game he'd score a hat trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes that feeling gets to you", Jagr said after Giroux scored the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second attack from the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goal line for the puck and presented it to goaltender Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first half, home player Patrick Dwyer made a drop, but the start of the second half was the Flyers's.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds converted a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league but he's really in the top three", Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd be playing with a hockey player like him at the end of my career".
"I'm really happy about that".
"I want to play on him".
"All these years in the NHL the other players on the team tried to play me, now it's my turn", Jagr added.
Caroline made a big deal out of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty kick she ends up with a goal difference.
Matt Read didn't rule out further complications, which ended in a two-on-one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area".
"He tapped on the paddle, I picked up speed and (Read) headed for the furthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got it", Voracek described the final goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia came in with this win leading the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo. He came in second-third because of an upper-body injury.
The Canadiens didn't face an experienced defender their two-butset lead was lost after a 2-3 penalty shoot-out.
Tomas Plekanec hasn't converted any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that bothered the local coach more than losing hands because they played the game with only 5 defenders.
"This sucks".
"We played the game with only one experienced player, the rest were youngsters".
"But there is nothing to do, it is like that", says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement that was not enough and we could not resist".
"We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our zone".
We had limits to that", added one of the advocates, P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender who took part in the 30th attack on Winnipeg and the victory at Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters have come up with the Jets' goals, which have stopped a five-game losing streak.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered tours mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists were on holiday in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then the regime began to lean westward and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (including Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed an invitation letter otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at this time also offered trips to the West, however you had to stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good acquaintance" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't won yet.
The currency agreement which was a condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currency (Western currency) for travel to the West.
The Czechs spent most of their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit continues to this day.
Since 1989, the Czech travel industry has undergone a major revolution.
Although holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their peak until 1989, Czechs spent 4 million holiday days abroad in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to travel freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in the western neighbouring countries has led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria, Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not for long fly to the West, which everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel agencies made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income was not enough to pay for a hotel or a boarding house.
The typical trait of a Czech traveller at that time was to take with him his own canned food, sausage, etc... to save money.
Another important moment was the exchangeability of the Czech króna, which finally allowed our tourists to buy Western currency freely after decades.
Our standard of living and average wage have increased, which led to another important moment around 1997.
The increasing demand for travel has led travel agencies to start planning tours with charter flights since 1997, which have been considerably cheaper than before thanks to contracts.
In the late 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually all the developed countries in the world except the US which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism was when the first charter flight to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
Over 100,000 Czechs visit these exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the US abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully join the group of developed countries.
In 2008 too, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time ever spent more than 15 000 kroner per person on holidays abroad including the associated costs.
The General Assembly must find its President but it may end in a situation without a solution
Almost five months have passed since Czech football was without a president and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Hasek as head of the Czech Football Association will not yet be known after another general assembly to be held in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting procedure to follow.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the Czech football management.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek did football return to divergences between the chambers of the Association which could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House in Prague because the negotiations were blocked and there was not even a discussion on how to vote.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote at the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or the fully-authorized officials.
On this one point there has since been a partial agreement, with the help of the Bureau for State and Law, that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Disagreements still persist over the rules of procedure for the election.
It is all too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations has also made no contribution to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the key point remains the same.
The question is, how do we proceed on the third round so as not to fall in the trap?
"The key to the dispute is that either we follow the statutes or we find another model", said one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Football Association, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association.
The rules of the proposed model state that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes in the chamber for which he is running wins the third round.
Moravia is reportedly ready to withdraw so that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of the votes in both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is considering the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the voting percentage.
"Only then would the idea of two previous rounds be lost and the bicameral concept completely rejected", admits Svoboda, who understands the Moravian Party's objections and who believes it would be best not to change the rules of procedure and to vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the electoral rules established by the statutes benefit the most Pelta of all the candidates.
"I want the votes to be as strict as possible in accordance with the articles of association".
"So that there are no more crazy ideas from a representative like in past general meetings", said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a first-time candidate and who in his presentations has been mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
He said that Nymburk would have a new President and that the candidates would work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification for the European Championship today should calm everyone down".
"Football will be on a happy wave again and there will be more enthusiasm for cooperation", adds the Jablonec official, who among the three has the most experience in managing both professional and regional football.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense".
"This is not a problem between Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to change the drawing rules".
"This could cause another deadlock at the General Assembly".
"I still hope that common sense will win", said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement on all sides.
Some meetings are expected to take place directly in Montenegro but who can say whether the entire football department will be ready for the match.
The specially chartered flight that was to take Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl to Podgorica, among others, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the retaliatory ground.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to welcome the torn parties in the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which has to determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik goes to the presidential race because he doesn't see any good candidates.
If the head of Plzen's football team, Tomas Paclik, had seen before the General Assembly the profile of the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT), he would not have been running for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for election".
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate", Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from becoming the head of the AFRT, which would be given a priori favourite for this election.
Paclik also stresses that if he wins the elections he will hold the post of President only until 2013 when a General Assembly is scheduled.
He would see in the position an experienced manager of high level but not connected with the world of football.
"I've talked to people who would have the profile", he said.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me that they did not want to be identified with Czech football at the moment".
"I would like to change that image", he added.
What is said to be most troubling Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man of distorted reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist able to influence the vote of delegates' the General Assembly.
Paclik is not happy with Pelta holding this position.
"If he wins, the status quo will remain and there will be nothing new in football".
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying businessman, it would be even less favourable to football", Paclik proclaimed.
What is even more shocking is that Pelta's name was mentioned a few years ago during a wiretap in a corruption investigation, and that Pelta got away with it.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football".
"And how would we be seen in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", says Paclik, who said recently "if Pelta becomes president, I will sell the Plzen club".
In the event Paclik wins the vote on Thursday, he should be able to prove he can cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the fiasco General Assembly in September, feels the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with".
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to run for, say, the position of head of the representation".
"But as manager of the Association he would not be able to".
"I don't stick my nose in what I don't know", says Paclik, who in September drew a lot of attention when he voted to cancel the arbitration panel with Ludek Macela and Dagmar Damkova replacing him.
Paclik claims he's qualified to run the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to manage private firms and that he has also been managing the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated its first division triumph with his support last May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it".
"I would curb the influence of certain interest groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commissions, which leads to bad taste", added Paclik, who does not seek his dislike for Sparta boss Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level politicians would allow more money to be obtained for sport from the games tax.
"This is one of the key issues the new president should be concerned about".
"If it is about the gambling tax as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes", he said.
Paclik does not take his current association with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself says that the AFRT president should be "above the parties".
Pelta was again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"This is not ideal".
I see no reason to pass on my Plzen club shares to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later", Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to the pat situations.
Two days before the Football Association's General Assembly one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the AFRT would have new statutes that should end future disputes over the rules for elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and thinks that today's success of the football match should calm this quarrel before the vote.
Pelta, before the election in September, which did not take place, promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if elected.
He decided to run at the last minute just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay may well allow him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and they're waiting for Thursday to be a president".
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the management of the Association", he adds, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for many years in Sparta and on the Union's Executive Committee.
That's also why he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that reigned in the days of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not perfect as everyone realized".
"If it weren't for all these different interpretations we would have had a President already in September", emphasises Pelta.
It was the revision of the most important document of the civic association that caught the attention of the delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal mission and I am prepared to take full responsibility if it doesn't work out".
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist", added Pelta.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously said that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl, which he acknowledges given his legal background and that he knows full well that his opponent would be his first Vice-President.
He has also not attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who, on the contrary, keeps criticizing Pelta.
"He's been playing football for a year and has had some successes".
"His attacks were not, however, the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign".
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character", Pelta said of his opponent but said he remained true to the proclamations he made in September.
He says his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national team.
It should be a football display.
"And I would also endeavor to finish all the cases that begin with the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal".
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sectors so that we can get enough money for all football", the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring about any change of people.
"I should get acquainted with all the employees", he told Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios foreseen with the General Assembly, he believes the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round we will overcome it".
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head", as Pelta optimistically states two days before the likely decisive day in his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT will start working hard
"If the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the general meeting on Thursday, it will not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by his predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I want to take care of football as a whole".
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance youth football".
"But I'm not saying I'm going to do it all by myself", Rajchl told CTK in an interview.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the competences within the Executive Committee so that each member deals with a specific area".
"And I will hand out difficult assignments to make football face a big step forward".
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others", he added.
He has stated, it is said, that he will not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"As for me, everyone knows I work 20 hours a day".
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will keep putting sticks in my wheels and questioning every single thing I do", explaining why he was hesitant.
"Many people told me not to give up because they would too".
"It's a trust I cannot betray", he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"The last two years have been a lot of hard work and I don't want to let it go".
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them", he said, fearing that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union would return to what it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't know how to do".
"Behind him are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen".
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not for enduring any".
"I try to be objective".
"I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy not just those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would be only a president for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do the maximum for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the second division into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, the winners of which would be in the first division".
"There would be no situation like now with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
Since Tomas Paclik, the president of the Plzen Club, entered the race for the presidency, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I feel the constant support of the Czech Chamber, which elected me its vice-president and knows that with me there will be successes", said Rajchl, who envisages among his future successes saving tens of millions of kroner on disadvantageous contracts, television contract negotiations and the gambling law.
He says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault.
While he says of Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him Czech football would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that Plzen has done a great job this year".
"If elected he would certainly continue in what Hasek started and would not make a noticeable change among the people in the Commissions".
"He would not want to waste his successes", said Rajchl, assessing his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A leap in the blue
By Julia Stanek
UFO-optic paddles, beautiful swimming pools in Budapest: Travelers across Europe can experience the blue miracle - and after circling the city or taking a long walk - can rest their tired legs in hot tub waters.
A book shows which swimming pool can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the last 18 months, there was one item that should not be missing from her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam up against the putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and never failed to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If she liked an indoor pool, she would promptly write down in her notebook all the interesting details about the type of building and its history.
More than 200 pools have been surveyed in this way by architectural historian Meder and she has presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden" (Bath Joys).
She has led her "trips to the most exceptional baths of Central Europe" in 13 countries. Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
Meder explains that she has little interest in sports but is drawn to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimming fans have to be content to gaze at blue tiles and the stench of bleach while joggers breathe in the enchanting scent of the spruce forests or can listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly", said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths".
The water surface doubles the strength of the architecture
A swim in a pool and the volatile sauna oils - a well-being factor in swimming pools - are huge because all the senses are awake, Meder says.
And if the builders had put in more effort, the swimming pools could be a delight to the eye: "Instead of a floor, there is a surface of water in the swimming pools".
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building".
All surfaces are visually presented in two ways: high vaults, multicolored tiles, stepping stones.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical wellbeing - it certainly makes you want to jump into the blue.
Collector Meder discovered some remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Besides splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
While the roof of the Zurich Bathhouse offers a spectacular view of the entire city, the snow-capped Arlberg can be seen from an outdoor pool in St. Anton.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise to the sky.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths have a sulphur smell, the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba has a strong oil smell, which is hard to believe in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline water containing almost black carbonic hydrogen, and its mud sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
Iris Meder also experienced disappointment in her search for beautiful pools. When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded area.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
Looking out the window of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she observed the weeds blooming between the tiles.
She observed the opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Bad Wildbad Bath Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; not only are there neo-Romanesque elements from its design in 1844 but also a Moorish Alhambra-style hall that was added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of swimming pool expert Iris Meder - and not just because it is from the Black Forest.
"It's a beautiful thing to be able to blend so many different building styles into one great unit", says Meder.
With such a palate, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
The German central bank examines in detail commodity speculation
As told by Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its commodity speculation?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to study the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wants to draw conclusions.
- What is it ?
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the point is clear: According to one survey, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on commodities such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of those surveyed even demand that the German bank and other lending institutions stop this business because it adds to the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities drives prices up and that banks are complicit in world hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is in concrete terms aligned with the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are doing the same.
Speculation on commodities was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But most experts now share the view that gamblers have detached themselves from supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from his US competitors: he promised to investigate the allegations and said, "no case is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE an international task force is currently reviewing the Foodwatch-Report allegations.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank board of directors must be presented - usually with a recommendation.
The Bank's President will announce the consequences at the end of January.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
The head of Foodwatch, Thilo Bode, welcomed the news but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how badly today's banks are harming the public interest".
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, where money has been invested in food speculation", Bode said.
"It doesn't matter to Mr Ackermann whether it's about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake".
Ackermann's realization may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group's CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman of the board of directors will not change anything about what is planned in the board.
It could improve its brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And as for any losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will.
One in two would stop investing in commodities.
Foodwatch is trying to keep a tight rein on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11 percent found it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices are bet on.
Many bank customers would also be personally affected if they knew that their bank was involved in such transactions. One in two would, according to the survey, cancel all investments where money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 per cent would not recommend such a bank to others, 49 per cent said they would consider closing their account to change bank.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that Moved
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of this Regulation.
An architectural story with ups and downs and a happy ending: the Austrian pavilion for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, then sat empty and fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and is an exhibition house.
If you are enthusiastic about postwar modern architecture, its clear shapes, glass hangars, bold, vibrant look and new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix of Architecture" for its lightweight, suspended, steel and glass construction.
The building is considered to this day an important milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian World Exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His design of the pavilion as a temporary building had been exhibited after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the artwork on, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for as long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it is now called the "21st Century House" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opened the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every way.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career including in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she particularly successfully carried out transformation work with politicians and monument protection, she obtained public and private sponsorship funds and established the operation.
Apart from contemporary art, works by the sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation bears the same name, have been exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office is to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the production Krischanitz was therefore the ideal performer.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and lightness after it moved to Vienna and changed its use.
The current transformations had major problems: the building was "an energy gap", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was laid and the roof replaced with special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled covers have been rehabilitated.
Two basements made way for the new farm, a dimmed light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in a rust-protective red-brown tint.
And the theater is even exactly the same as it was.
All this under close supervision of the relevant monuments authorities and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and cheap had to be found, and that also appeal to the Office of Monuments Protection", says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building has remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City" story.
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the 21st century house is not in the wrong place, because if it is a lucky urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands the newly planned "central station district", with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may come: the 21st century house could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in the millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million this year.
The daily Bild-Zeitung previously reported, citing an internal crisis plan of the group, that investments totalling around EUR 300 million were planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for snow removal at railway installations and docks is expected to double to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the docks of snow and ice by the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the station manager Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference about the train accidents that also happened this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems with passenger transport, because it lacked, among other things, reserves in case of bad weather.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot of work to do for years, as it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked at the workshop much more often, after an axle break occurred on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines to the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann, there is news in the United States: the German bank Deutsche Bank has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not enough, the industry giant's past also makes up for it in the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays, in comparison, $145 million (€106 million) to settle a dispute over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage paperwork.
The NCUA, the regulator of financial markets, has accused the big banks of a series of charges, including that they have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products, which they claim minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and drove the banks into the ground.
"We are pleased that we have been able to find a solution to this without the parties having to go to court", said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The Bank did not admit any fault in comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the cooperative banks in the United States and intervenes in bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage caused by the multi-billion dollar.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took on other large banks and in the summer it took JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs to court.
As far as the issue of mortgage documents is concerned, they are "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit unions are the basis.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the events are a few years old, the American banking system is currently in a state of disarray.
Investors and supervisors have brought numerous actions to obtain redress or to punish infringements.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, two US government real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of taking advantage in kind of mortgage deals worth about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also to bring an action against the FHFA in respect of several transactions totalling USD 14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities are asking for the "substantial losses" to be borne by Frankfurt, but without specifying a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett adds 10 billion to IBM.
Buffett, the financial guru, invests huge sums of money in IBM's IT business.
Since March, he has bought more than ten billion dollars worth of stocks.
Until then, the American investor Warren Buffett kept saying he didn't want to invest in IT companies, because the long-term outlook for the companies was always bad.
He did, however, read IBM's reports and changed his mind about investing in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM mainly provides IT services and systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a chivalrous attack in the world of finance.
The IBM IT business is therefore entitled to be known as Mr IBM.
Because Buffett revealed today on CNBC Business Show that he has bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway thus became a major shareholder in IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM never knew about this commitment until now.
He commended the management, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
"You did a great job", Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been investing in profitable IT services as an accounting centre operation for some time.
The 100-year-old pioneer of computer science offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance enterprise computers.
Buffett had so far avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies he understands the business of.
But Buffett's focus is on rail freight, lubricants, and machinery.
Its Berkshire Hathaway holding company has nearly 80 subsidiaries and holdings in a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it into one of the world's most prestigious companies through smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why he's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unerring sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After Buffett's investment announcement, IBM stock went up one percent on the stock market.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, has a market capitalization of over $220 billion and is ranked with Apple and Microsoft among the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want any part of it.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" now being revived.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek business between 2000 and 2006 had an extremist context.
The news has caused fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population.
For many German-Turks, the specter of what had long been thought to be the dead is reappearing: since the firebombings in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this extreme right-wing context against Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology", was the headline of the Turkish daily Haberturk's online article.
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors was a man from the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany has done a good job of calling for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence at the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Only two weeks earlier the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
The cohabitation was staged in bright colors, symbolizing a success story.
The reports in some Turkish media are a slap in the face: "Germany's gift for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish news platform Haber X, which refers to the context of the series of murders.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" therefore does not dispense with the unambiguous conditions.
"it starts to stink", is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people were allegedly murdered, paid taxes and made a major contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police's action was highly criticized on German-Turkish forums and the success of their investigation was subsequently debated.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier of investigating some suspected far-right circles, the authors wonder?
More than one is prepared to use at least rhetorical or even drastic measures: "If the matter continues to go badly, the migrants will have nothing but self-defense and weapons".
"it's the best self-defense".
"The internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network", writes "Selen".
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger was clearly shown by the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the ruins after the fire in Solingen is deeply ingrained in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, that mistrust and distance through violence can lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the sense of "we" in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
The failure of German policy in the past after the attacks that the Turkish press has complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish head of state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if a man's worth could be measured by the amount of his tax burdens.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German-Turks towards the local rule of law has been since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Bank at Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been slipping from one crisis to another.
A German must be in charge now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had in mind.
After his spectacular departure from the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost as spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly cheered, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently achieved strength and made kind remarks about future colleagues.
"UBS has made the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But by September it was clear that everything was about to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all the Bank's security systems and had inflated about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of directors of UBS has since been considered a patient - and everyone is asking: when will Axel Weber finally return?
We already learned that Weber can be a bank advisor starting in February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman as early as May - not in 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is becoming difficult.
He's not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he certainly would have needed a period of adjustment.
He suddenly takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of 'Europe's biggest scandal-ridden bank'.
Indeed, UBS is huge on one side - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing seems to spare the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent, solid but also cunning Swiss asset manager was combined with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of investment banking.
So UBS was managing on one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks.
It was impressive.
Former banker Hans Geiger, who later taught banking for many years in Zurich, says: "I always took UBS as a model of good banking for my students".
"In the current context, one wonders: How could I have been so simply wrong?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it became clear for the first time that something was not right at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli, who was once considered a top intellectual and a brilliant banker, unexpectedly resigned.
A few months later, we got a sense of why he left.
The bank's division had been blown up with sub-prime papers and had to cross billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of FRF 13 billion and marked it with a cross.
It did find investors, but they would have frowned a short time before: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was passed over so quietly that its name was never even heard.
But that was only the first time.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was again to report losses in the billions, and the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, retired.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was in the pre-bankruptcy financial crisis due to its investment mistakes and had to be rescued by the State.
The national bank bought tens of billions of bad bonds from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because they noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to have such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We failed to save UBS once again", says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first calamity, the second followed.
Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of wealthy customers, who had cheated the tax, perhaps with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions with a higher fine.
So UBS pretty much published that it had helped tax evasion.
At the same time, it lost something that has always been its capital in competition with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was not the same.
The Chairman of the Management Board and the Chairman of the Management Board resigned.
And the flow of customer money.
The bank had thus lost its credibility in a matter of months in its two main business sectors: investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of aid to tax evasion.
And as there was a somewhat calm return, and as we thought, that UBS would pull through, this unfortunate story of bond dealers followed: a single bond dealer flashed 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And they say, with risk management in investment banking, it still doesn't seem to work.
"The Adoboli case showed that risk management has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is convinced: "The problem with UBS is that it has no control over the risks".
However, this was exactly the prudent idea with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken up their function, that of becoming the custodians of the world's great fortune: not too great risks, but security for the money - and the world might well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasuries of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli are for particularly fine chocolate.
The UBS Zurich headquarters still fits the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it's only slightly larger.
It's already a classic situation.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which is itself surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss Alps.
The buildings here are prestigious, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's, you can find them here among the traditional Swiss shops as well as those at Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Credit Suisse palace to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
We enter the lobby of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank's logo is a large "safe" label.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another put the market out of business - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He'd rather not read his name in the paper, because like all Swiss bankers he also does business with the two big banks.
UBS would have become far too big, he says - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would have spread further.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And yet they have long since adapted to the ways of the Anglo-Saxons".
It was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the coalition government of the small country of seven million people embarked on the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
With up to about $4 billion, the politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mostly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three largest Swiss banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and it kept growing.
What helped was that UBS's two different predecessors were complementary: a rich but lethargic bank with its strong point in asset management in Zurich and a poorer but certainly already more internationalised one.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team", says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very good at models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has worked his way to the top with his banking apprenticeship".
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli to the end.
And Wuffli would probably have made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic fall".
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before fall.
UBS staff clearly remember executive meetings where the head of the Wuffli Group always spoke the same slogan: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which at the time documented the success of banks.
After all, UBS wanted to go all the way up.
He's already taken some steps.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The company advisers, who were responsible for this, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest rate transactions, in the banking jargon of "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS is alleged to have shortcomings in the US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its life.
Thirsty for growth, it was both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that invested.
It became a massive machine that packed and moved the valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages - but also kept the risks.
Even when other banks had been looking to go down for a long time.
"Back in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market was on fire, UBS bought it", says Geiger, a banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when stopping the attempts proved more difficult than expected.
Positions at UBS have become expendable and are still banking.
The man who runs the big bank has an almost impossible job.
He has to come up with a strategy for a bank, for which all the business models suggested have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, already has an idea: end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want to go that far.
But the investment bank must be atrophied vigorously, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday, the head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss-Italian was only supposed to be on a temporary basis when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has established himself as the long-term leader of UBS, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress it was in the mid-1990s.
He's cutting 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What's she gonna do for money?
These are questions that Axel Weber has certainly asked himself.
He has only publicly said so far that he and his wife are going to look for an apartment in Zurich.
- I'll see you next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged American investors.

Smart crow spreads to cities
In many places, the freckles are considered a "bird problem". But experts say that these highly intelligent animals have long been hunted out of cities.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The ravens have been part of the city for centuries, but in many communities residents have been complaining about the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it was no longer possible to hunt the toads from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have been deliberating on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities.
The environmentalists also based the problems of cities on the exodus of specially protected waste: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, cultivating, and cutting down the typical nesting trees made life difficult for the birds.
The ravens are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project was given negative publicity because of the slaughter of ravens in the area.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and killing them with clubs particularly brutal.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless", said Leer city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Destroying nests with water under pressure or cutting down trees often has unwanted consequences, says environmentalist Manfred Kaiser of Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are moving away, the large colonies are splitting up and they are scattered to other places".
The only exceptional cases of eviction are in hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them".
The problem cannot be solved in cities without including the periphery, according to the opinion of Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of alienation of animals in aversive packaging and catchy offers to allow them to resettle elsewhere is conceivable.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "information signs instead of chainsaws" to establish a completely different relationship with them: "We can finally bear a bump in the face better with a dose of confidence".
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Wandernutzung der Müllkorb in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these highly intelligent frogs.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: The freaks not only use tools to get a treat but they make their own tools as tools.
Ethologists at Cambridge University recently tested four species of birds to see how intelligent they are.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to knock down a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much practice, they were determined to recognize that a stone had to be of a certain size and shape to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second experiment, the clever ravens were then asked to solve a more complicated problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with their beaks.
However, researchers had made pieces of wire available.
All four creatures formed a hook with which they caught the little bucket from the little pipe.
Three out of four things you can do right from the start.
Cristiano Ronaldo has won the European Championship 2012 with Portugal
Hopes of a coup by the Bosnians and Turks were dashed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifiers for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and knocked out Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal strayed against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0-0 game, their fifth appearance in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the knockout round by Montenegro 1-0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been a matter of course.
Nothing was more hot in the 0-0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland taking a 1-1 (1:0) lead against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80), scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga player Zvjezdan Misimovic with an 11-metre penalty handed (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) both made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic faced a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal, the start was well-measured.
Ronaldo sent a 30-yard free kick into the net.
After a quarter of an hour, Nani showed her skills at shooting from a distance and shot from a distance of 25 meters to make it 2-0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to the striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English league Manchester City initiated a head ball aimed down the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
And finally, the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding in the spotlight.
After an attack against Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the other hand, Stark awarded an 11-yard penalty played to the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European champion managed four strokes and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champion will thus go to the EM for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with the legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), were also lucky and had to survive a shock moment in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex.
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossbow had to come to the rescue of the already downed world-class Czech goalkeeper, once again, the FC Seoul striker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle during this time.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0-0 draw.
While national coach Guus Hiddink had to give up his place on the bench in the third round of the 2002 European Championship, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round of the European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up to a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, striker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
Apart from Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legends Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the pitch.
Trapattoni is participating in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team under coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a 4-0 success the first leg for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57) equalised for the visitors.
Ireland pushed for the top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy was given the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian defence prevent a possible goal from the first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After a failed defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and pressed the ball into the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double its workforce in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double its number of employees in the country.
Up to 2015, about two billion dollars ($1.6 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly", CEO Bill McDermott told his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The number of employees will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world's leading enterprise software company will double from five to 10 or 11.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP's 176,000 global customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.

"Now we want to expand our activities . . . " said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information".
The personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book, "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", offers depth and generosity.
A tip to start with: Tear this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
In this romantic tale by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Here he wrote an extraordinary book which he accurately describes as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few famous names, important treaties, or famous battles; it contains almost no ambassadors or discussion of strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he says, but a "book describing what it might have been like", containing "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the conflict, from young school girls and botanists to rock climbers, doctors, paramedics and salesmen.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some will be taken prisoner of war, some will be maimed, some will go insane, some will be killed.
Their lives here waver like the candles of a church, and as some go out, new ones are lit.
Peter Englund's book is a departure from traditional history books.
It refutes the idea that the First World War was only a terrible trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully describes other war zones - the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one is spending Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are a problem that cannot be solved.
This book is moving from the first page.
War is invading their lives like a natural disaster, like the stinking Hurricane Katrina.
When cannon fire is heard in the distance, and you're a stay-at-home mom, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been compounded by speculation, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors".
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mainly based on memoirs, letters and other material that has already been published.
Their versions of life can be frightening or exciting, but they're best preserved through the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them are about deprivation and the ability to cope.
In recounting the experience of a German school girl, Peter Englund wrote: "Ersatz, überall ersatz".
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons, and so on".
He's still working on food replacement in Germany.
It describes "meat made from rice cooked in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles".
It states that "837 meat substitutes are registered in the production of sausages, and 511 coffee substitutes are also found".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American acknowledged his own drive for savagery and said of war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant to do, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair with a cigarette and whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that such a veneer is a symbol of civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your tight, nailed shirt.
A British soldier, on the other hand, realizes that he is in danger of death, and that no one will notice or pay attention.
"When you are resigned to sacrifice, you hope to have an audience", he writes.
Unfortunately, it is more like "a man condemned to be strangled in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of old Europe and new forms of terrorism.
"Conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition", writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories".
He sees the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the animal kingdom of the early 20th century: the articulate, ideologically convinced, well-dressed mass murderer who carries out his slaughter while sitting behind a counter".
People act in unexpected ways; there are as many basic as heroic behaviors.
Peter Englund tells of soldiers who tried at all costs to catch venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression is found in the trade in gonorrhea pus, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital", he writes.
"The most desperate people apply it to their eyes, which results in permanent blindness".
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures how the war "brought forth forces that were entirely uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, antipathy to religion".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are at war with them.
The best books on World War I are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's Great War and Modern Memory or Erich Maria Remarque's Nothing New in the West, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The ending of the book is the most overwhelming I've ever read in a nonfiction work.
I won't tell.
But it's like he came out of his book, you're holding that page with the list of people and you're burning it with a match.
After a first slip, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others who were informed from the beginning that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges to the police department.
There could be no repeat of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which went against departmental regulations and sparked a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clear Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the progress of the occupations in other cities.
A major exercise was organized on Randall Island for the Zuccotti Park operation.
Police officers are getting better training on riot control - counterterrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan area.
The last training session was held Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move into the park came "at the last minute", said a regular, referring to the operation as "just a drill".
"The few police officers I know who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park", the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who know they're going to go are at the top of the police department".
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police tried to clean the park but were repelled by hundreds of protesters who were informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including task forces from across the neighborhood - dozens of officers familiar with particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that many people came and went to the park during the day, like migrants, so one o'clock in the morning was a good time.
"It was best to do it when the park was least crowded", he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages echoing from loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply packed up and left.
No tents were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving the occupants time to pack up their belongings.
Other police teams were seen around the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the police chief, said the move was purely for safety reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, being severely restrained by the officers.
Browne said the TV camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the thick clutter of protesters' business, including luggage, plastic grass and leaf bags full of clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up anything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away, and the images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took their seats near the camp kitchen, not far from the park center.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
About ten people in the epicenter of the camp clung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park before 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleanup operation was completed about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "disturbing public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, is the highest ranking officer to have been on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "was not running the operation", Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of an emergency.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them armed with shields, were even reportedly seen pushing people away.
There were about 28 people on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
At about 5:00 a.m. south of Pine Street, one protester jumped onto the hood of a police car, and others were seen puncturing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came out of the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The school assistants union is suing the city for redundancies.
The union, which represents hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month, plans to file a lawsuit Wednesday against the city for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals, which have a disproportionate impact on schools that serve disadvantaged students.
Lawsuits are probably the union's ultimate weapon, 37th District Council, in trying to get the layoffs reversed.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, among the city's lowest paid, lost their jobs on October 7th, and union leaders likened the layoffs to political retaliation for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by workers' groups that would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The city authorities flatly denied this accusation.
At a city council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that was finalized in June.
A member of the Council responded by saying that the dismissals of school assistants were not specified in the budget.
Council officials in the 37th District said they would file a notice of complaint, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit in Manhattan State Supreme Court.
The plaintiffs will be represented by eight dismissed female workers, all black or Latino, like most of the school assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet seen the reasons for the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint obtained by The New York Times, the union relied on the number of dismissals in schools in the city's poorest neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid because of regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school help lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants at Harlem Public School 36, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the lawsuit says that "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget gap".
Public School 36's budget was cut by 3.26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrolled.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term 'overreach' to describe the action, although 'overreach' more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parent coordinators were fired", and "not just for overstepping".
Mission accomplished: Congress reaches agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats have finally reached an agreement on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It would have required a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to make a decision next Tuesday, with the support of President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the US troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is about honouring the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country", said John Kerry.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations".
The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed, as did the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions to approve or disapprove of the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and never came to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure to reduce funding for US operations in Libya.
The US mission thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress sufficiently upset to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The Congress' indecision has been overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to the rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the US Armed Forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or will it divide lawmakers as it did last June?
Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest draft of the new bill.
In the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments passed but they have tried.
The Goodlatte Amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring - the same bill being proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations on a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of the balanced budget amendment alone, and a handful of others that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters - especially new Republicans who want to gold their CVs - a chance to brag about being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for a vote by the House and Senate on the amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment to ban same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment to prohibit desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose it.
As eager as Members have been to propose amendments, they are not as quick as in the past.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is slowing down from the early 1990s, when members typically proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures from the Senate Library.
But those amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Slaughtered but not beaten", says Gabrielle Giffords in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on a television show Monday night, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get better first rather than return to Congress.
While appearing on ABC's "20/20" television news show, opposite Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show dealt with his difficult return after the bullet fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, passing through his head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied, "Rather well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was aired on a one-hour special edition of "20/20", the day before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
This special has been tracking Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the Jan. 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during his first few weeks, he is seen in his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A nod of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change her breakfast menu.
The videos aired by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: the Representative is seen singing with the doctors the tune of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'?"
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours a day with the doctors, said she has no memory of the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information about the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is undergoing extensive treatment pending trial.
"There were a lot of deaths", Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, and hard, and hard, and hard, and hard, and hard".
When she was recovering, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten".
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you haven't been beaten,'" said Mark Kelly.
You just got slaughtered.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for the homeless veterans of New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in ties stood at his feet and applauded him.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes", said Spring Fundraiser organizer David Saltzman.
A senior military official present at the gala, including Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as a kind of orphans", the senior military official wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know, I know.
But it wasn't respect, it was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
The troops are praised for their sacrifices.
But they come at a price, some military officials say.
The public is acting more and more as if they're sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way to sustain ourselves is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits".
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War was far worse.
So most of the compassionate conversations are held in private among veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they've faced insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who were running interviews for him were subtly asking if he would be able to hold out under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after returning from combat.
"When you talk about service, you get negative impressions", recalls Colonel Cancian when speaking to his sons.
The military's difficulties arise, in part, from American indifference to war.
Victory is rarely celebrated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we don't value heroism the same way we did in World War II", says retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare for the next one.
Private Elizabeth Lyman, 1st Class, was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was October of 2008, and she was walking home from dinner with a friend at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It was a wake-up call", says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan put her worries aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas", she said.
"I should have followed my gut".
Minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and some not, will eagerly await the court's decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of failing to stop the widespread rape in the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claimed that the military failed to investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's coming after the military's bullies because they're the problem.
"The army is a vertical structure", she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Her strategy: instead of bringing all the plaintiffs together in this case - putting all her eggs in one basket - she will file multiple lawsuits, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the military cannot be sued by serving or non-serving soldiers for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
"The alleged wrongdoing is inherent in the plaintiffs' military service", the documents state.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the '50s.
While women are still not officially allowed to go to war, this distinction is only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely exclusively men.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers play an increasingly important role, particularly in contacting local women.
As a result, 150 female soldiers were killed in both wars - two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight. Three other trials are under way in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to discharge them - a relatively common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way they process claims for benefits for those who report being sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills were introduced to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense's Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, for the Pentagon itself estimates that this figure represents about 13.5 percent of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 percent of cases registered in the military were prosecuted - half the percentage of the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Susan Burke case describe their assault as the first in a series of trauma attacks.
In Lyman's case, she notified the military police of the rape less than an hour after the fact.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She was subjected to a "rape kit", and the blood of her assailant - from a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier in the day of her assault.
Six people testified as moral witnesses for the perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down", says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions, and I started screaming after the court".
"I was placed in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'This was not his trial, this was mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, barring her from any benefits.
Whether the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs will go forward is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he remarks, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward".
Only this doctrine, which has been criticized since its introduction, stands between them and a verdict.
I've always been critical of the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it lacks the same advantages and deterrence that responsibility brings.
"The odds are very much against them... but it is important that they try", he adds.
These things only change when the good guys are willing to fight.
If the case does not go in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will bring her hundreds of other plaintiffs together for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform", she says.
Or until we die, one of two things.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a murderous frenzy in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers are eager to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy... log in to Facebook.
"We realised that it wasn't that hard to find them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is so full of personal information, Jamie Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they're looking for with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. They targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to participate in a survey. The questions asked were about their education level, their attitudes towards violence and their optimism about their own future.
By connecting with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It's a new way of doing research", says Jamie Bartlett.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly men, young people and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens".
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues like social trends, through likes, wall posts and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, the 'data supernova' is driving an explosion in search, increasing the number of research papers with the site's name in the title by almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to survey people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You had to go to the party, but they would never let you in", says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all of this - you have direct access to their information".
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and treat health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues, young college students who shared their drunken exploits on Facebook were far more likely to be alcoholic than students who did not.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to help in the event a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it", says Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington.
"We know how to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be identified".
Facebook also constantly gains access to user information.
The site's data team studied statistics on dating and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (based on information only available - champions of digital freedom have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed access to your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines for how to gather information other than through the Internet, online is a very different matter.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could look at their profile", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, based on a 2006 study he conducted by looking at his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends".
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even without an Internet connection, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study will be completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know the truth of a user's profile or wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in real life are two completely different things", says Neil Selwyn.
That's why, despite his background as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and a pen are still the best tools you can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people", he says.
"Social studies is supposed to be about social issues - and social issues are not about computers".
"Cold and Inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to orchestrating the two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter when he first appeared in court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars", he told a 500-person courtroom.
"As for the jurisdiction of the court, I decline it because you hold your mandate to organizations that support a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I acknowledge the facts, but I plead not guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views".
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a paper speech with him, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to be sure he would be put behind bars.
All of them attended the hearing with the aim of seeing the trial end.
"I found him cold and inhuman", a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian television station NRK.
"I was uncomfortable, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the courtroom.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belonged to a broad "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane and also stated that there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
So the attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of one extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may be comforting to some.
But this did not lessen the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have liked him to look like a monster, but he doesn't", said a relative of one victim.
"That would have been a lot easier".
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the movies this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - a technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find most telling in a recently found interview with Steve Jobs that will be released this week as the first part of a movie in major markets, is how much this creative mind had understood the processes and workflows of products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a chart improver - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease that leaves them thinking that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which chronicled the birth of the computer, and he sat down for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long, rare conversation.
At that time, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple, and he was already hard at work on his new computer company NeXT, aiming for a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies were lost in transport.
It wasn't until after Steve Jobs died that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly edited, is the basis of the 68-minute film, Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in theaters next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
At four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in an effort to provide a precise answer.
We also find moments where Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, elbowing him to get him to speed up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, there's a strangely prescient aspect to Lost Interview where Steve Jobs evaluates what he sees as good or bad about other companies and shares his own vision for the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous reviews of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then he puts them into practice.
Here's a quick recap of seven remarkable scenes from Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All these years, I've always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are always the same: 'Oh, simply because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to give details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Confused as to how costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" assessed at face value and then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory which ensured the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the possibility of playing a trick on the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into phone networks and make free long-distance calls.
The device has been the subject of much writing beforehand, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a pay phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We would wrap the ball in different things a half dozen times and you would yell into the pay phone and it would happen to you a minute later on the pay phone next door", Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and through this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We didn't know much, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control big things, and it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell of a wonderful trick that he and Wozniak devised: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several Catholic hierarchs are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go out laughing madly just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett's approach):
At the age of 12, while hunting for parts to make a frequency meter, he looked up Bill Hewlett's number in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated".
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's Palo Alto research labs, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed".
It was the size of a suitcase, had a little cathode ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On improvising innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
Early in his career, while he was selling printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble a complete computer.
He was only given 30 days' credit to assemble and deliver the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalled the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big arguments . . . people yelling at me that it would take me five years [to make a $300 mouse].
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and it was incredibly reliable.
About the big companies that are dying:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would make mistakes and lose control of their market share.
"Suppose you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can change it, so [these types of people] end up running companies and product people are left out of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine designing a good product versus a bad product - the manual labor required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the '90s.
They've wrested defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"A huge amount of manual work separates a great idea from a great product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows".
You learn a lot about its intricacies.
There are tradeoffs to be made -- some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep a thousand things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
And finally, the decisions are made by personal taste, and it's about trying to expose yourself to the best products that humans have created, and trying to bring those things into the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We're always ashamed to steal great ideas.
And that's part of what makes the Macintosh exceptional, because the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for computer science, they would have done some amazing things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dining with health care law opponents as the court sits
On the day the Supreme Court is meeting behind closed doors to consider the issue of political discord, whether opposition to President Obama's health care law will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will be defending the case before the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for review.
One of the cases in question involved a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, as a monumental argument at 5:30 is expected next March, and the outcome will likely be likely to further destabilize the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court ruling is issued.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue for the rejection of the law is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and a vocal opponent of the health care bill.
The star guests at the dinner?
This is not new. Both judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And there's nothing that goes against ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or be on the program of such an event".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in close proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and a flagrant disregard for the code contradicts several judges' statements that the Court follows the same rules as all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges were drinking and dining and at a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending in court".
Their presence and participation in the fundraising for this event disproves any claim to impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics claiming that they were too easily mixing court business with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
And the conservatives are claiming that it's Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethics problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general counsel for the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the trial court level.
Her critics pressured Kagan to decline to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record $18 billion in airliner orders
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle airliners, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal estimated to be worth more than $1 billion.
It is not unusual for a company to receive an order for 50 of its products.
But it is a big deal when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the 50 planes have reached a record $18 billion.
Equally amazing is where Boeing got this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777s with two-aisle flights.
It was Emirates Airlines based in Dubai that placed the order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger convenience.
The total value of these six aircraft is over a billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing", said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular are of immense value".
In the Middle East, oil producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only can they afford these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to the airlines because it is their biggest expense - would not be so detrimental to them since the country would make money from the rise in oil prices.
This is important because these airlines will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural risk cover", he said.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeing's dominance in the large-sized aircraft market and helps to curb the attempted encroachment by competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it was postponing the debut of the larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is postponing its start-up to increase its momentum following customer demand for increased cargo capacity and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president apparently defeated in the election in Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her rival Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governorship race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacán in a violent election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon reported on radio during an interview on Monday following the election.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officials... they took over the ballot boxes, they set up roadblocks... and they forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for 70 years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he arranged his return, and a victory in Michoacán was an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood only a short distance behind Calderon, who was leading the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential election for the divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the initial results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, the violence persisted.
A week before the election a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates locally gave up campaigning out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán election may seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year".
The BASD urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based BASD, said the world's two fastest growing economic powers must "do everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) against looking at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside European leaders and resources would help avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent but it is not immune".
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them".
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italy's debt has skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the world economy is heading for recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would provide all Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds from the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - gave greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from falling exports and a drying in of foreign capital.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We have monumental challenges to meet and we must maintain a high level of growth".
"This is not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get Europe to accept aid for the 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it", he said.
Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek civil servants in mismanaged and loss-making jobs, such as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to have "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces "risk of loss" due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "rescue plans" to protect themselves from economic upheaval and large capital outflows.
Severe warnings from the Pentagon about potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta stepped up pressure on Congress Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan to civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more of cuts are imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called a sequestration would result in 23% cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a large reduction, applied indiscriminately, would render most of our ships and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to part with a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the objective".
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our readiness".
The cuts would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"Although the wartime financing of the contingency operations accounts abroad is not directly affected by the sequester, the war effort would be adversely affected by the severe disruptions in basic budgets", warned Panetta.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of contracts that support the war".
"Wage managers would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted".
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compression on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a sequester on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader in military power".
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action", the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"It is not a consequence we can live with, and it is certainly not one we should impose on ourselves".
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about possible cuts, even though he himself rose to the top of the Pentagon after years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he was faced with tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what could happen - a soldier with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"This is a bullet-free brigade".
"It's a fighter jet, with no trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential adversaries".
"In fact, it invites aggression.. "
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: delay in responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable assumed risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could go to the ground, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship, and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its proponents say it is a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Spot a Lie
A glance at recent headlines shows how pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women, each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and shaken countries.
Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York and Internet celebrity, has been passed off as an idiot for quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to his coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, no one who has lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton started by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
There are many stories of cheating on school and college tests.
There have been cases where teachers have given test answers to students in order to make themselves look good on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
Studies show that on any given day, you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are godly lies.
Another study found that people lie to each other an average of three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting or spotting lies is a vital skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game like, say, charades, where the goal is to shout, "I've got you", cheat detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data gathered over the past six decades by prestigious universities that have conducted extensive research on such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don't stutter, blush, or get all worked up.
This does not mean that liars are hard to detect and unmask.
A trained lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, the micro-expressions of the face, the formation of the question and the time taken to respond.
I've spent several years reviewing scientific findings across the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it's clear that deception detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or management.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies while women tell more "other-centered" lies - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "set the data benchmarks".
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, the laughter, the quality of your voice.
You need to know if someone normally moves his feet all the time so that you don't make unfair accusations when you see him moving his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and nonverbal deception.
Consider these clues red flags, not evidence of deception.
Cheating people may immobilize their upper body when they try to remember their story, they may point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or present post-interview relief -- an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions are over.
Interviewers often falsely indicate that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
So be careful about the vocabulary of your subject.
Famous Scott Peterson went rogue by using the past while claiming his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national manhunt to find her.
Deceivers may also use distant language, such as "I did not have sex with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
One may use a lot of "wood tongue" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to be honest... if I remember correctly... as far as I know".
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but it is possible to develop the skills to recognize deception.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding being victimized by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be derailed after the threat of late US approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - sparking union anger while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the Nebraska Dunes and Ogallala aquifer areas, which are vast underground water sources.
"This is a real way forward", Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have delayed any decision until 2013, after next year's election, though officials deny any political involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's decision, and expressed his support.
The 2,735-kilometer pipeline would run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, he would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is being sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit in fear.
A New York family says that disco diva Patti LaBelle's outburst of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building has terrified their little girl to the point of vomiting in fear.
The singer's "Lady Marmalade" tirade frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk to the point that she suffered "personality changes, sleep problems" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10th of last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, a kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was getting his car, Roseanna Monk came down the hallway of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid her daughter down for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter does?' I said, 'Yes,' and I went to get her", she said.
LaBelle angrily rebuked the pregnant woman.
"She said in a very aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door,'" says Roseanna Monk.
I said, "I don't care what you say or think".
She became enraged and started using swear words - the word "and" and "and" out loud...
She had a bottle of water and started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who was still holding Genevieve - and had to be held up by her entourage who dragged her to a waiting car, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives have not returned our calls for comment.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money received to a children's cancer charity.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct", Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child".
The climate crisis has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's administration, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-proclaimed of change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress of the economy, but given the climatic adversity at the beginning of the year, the rise is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, apart from causing trillions of dollars in losses to the agricultural sector, limited the state economy's opportunities for growth, causing a contraction in overall economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic 31.16 percent decline in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report on frost impacts issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were 582.835 million hectares of cropland damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year has seen an accelerated rise, because while from January to March 55,053 Sinhalese were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economic Active Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand Sinhalese unemployed, an increase from the first half of the year of 18,969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions taken by public policy.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment which is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a resource restriction by the legislation passed in Congress to fight money laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work for it, to invest it and use it in something", he says.
Migration held
López Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to work abroad, in the United States, has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because when they come they already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people stay here and seek sources of work, which makes unemployment rise", he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is aggravated by the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in this state work there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the lag for the state is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Provision.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5 352 pesos, well below the national average of 7 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, 2011 saw the biggest decline in FDI in the last 10 years, according to the Economy Secretariat, from January to June the FDI of the state reached $630,000,697, which is a 87.74 percent decrease from $5,143,312 in the same period of the previous year.
The State Government's Economic Development Secretariat, in turn, reports a total investment of 17.280 trillion pesos a year, mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In view of the economic downturn, the State Government requested approval from the State Congress in July for a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy. The approval of the State Congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no benefit from the debt was observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For employers, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Processing Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the will of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have to align the effort of everyone and especially the good march already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better", he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year have held back the state's economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, including frosts, one of the main effects was a slow economy that did not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had", he says.
Redefining the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said the aim was to channel the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we unleash the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources", he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to produce good results in various areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme", he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way it manages public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do", he said.
Convicted of 8 kilos of marijuana
A Novolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fines for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office has informed that the convicted petty trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for health offenses, in his variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, outside number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was driving a white pickup truck, carrying a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and a small backpack in the driver's seat, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated evidence has been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted man is still in the Criminal Justice Enforcement Center.
Debts for contributions to works
The social projects covered by programmes such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes risk not being completed or experiencing serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although the construction programs have progressed so far, they are in a risky situation because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that the total investment for these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to contribute 12 million and despite the fact that the year is almost over they have not given us anything, even though since July they should have given us some", he said, "and we, so as not to register delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programmes, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the State had not paid", he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the arrangements for the corresponding percentages to arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to supply almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is almost over, they have given us nothing".
The Court approves "analog cutting" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to bring about the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was defeated for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is a task reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions it envisages for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers also decided to reject the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the President-in-Office said that he did not agree with the arguments of the draft, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure the measures for the public administration to prepare for it through general standards.
"I also do not consider that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", he said, adding that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector was the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate to lead the state.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying change, he argued, would be delaying the benefits of digitalisation which involves a decision in the public interest which is not only technical, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of a whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, which includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they did so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialised technical bodies.
The Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The possibility of a vote-by-vote count is being considered in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total 6,74 minutes.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" count is a reality in this year's election process in Michoacán, where according to data from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the 879 votes in the total of 6,74 minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not ratified its Political Constitution, State Electoral Code or Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this election process to take effect expired and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits set by the State Official Gazette Law, arguing that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state's representative for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal", as he does not have the right to "sanction or challenge" them.
When asked about the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that with the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
For example, the partial counting of votes in one or more electoral packages may be due to the following: the results of the voting records do not coincide; there is no voting record and the record of the vote is not in the register of the polling station; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the records.
In addition, the total number of votes received at all polling stations may be counted when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to have won the respective election and the candidate who came second in the poll is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition that presented the second of the nominated candidates.
The total vote count may also be carried out if at the end of the joint count it appears that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to have won and the candidate who came in second is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate came in second, in which case the electoral packages which were the subject of the partial count are excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation in the Morelia election, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, Sunday night, and on Monday, people will pay their respects and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapaliname mountains.
After receiving the tributes alongside the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, with the closest ones attending the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel of the vigil on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends gathered.
At 5:30 p.m., he was honored at the Saltillo Institute of Technology by his former technology bachelor's classmates and the American football team that Felipe Bacio was a member of when he was preparing for his bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Zapaliname, he always said this `` to his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
She said that the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considered him to be at the height of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and took great care of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo at a very young age to enroll in the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a truck problem, but he always pursued his dream of becoming a truck driver.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, for which he knows that his uncle is dying doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
His final farewell
With honors, the Mexican Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Bacio Cortés was given a farewell, a tribute led by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the Secretary of State, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all government officials.
The remains of Saltillo-born pilot Bacio Cortés arrived (incinerated) at 6:05 p.m. to be handed over by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's esplanade, where he was awaited by his family, including his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies, located on Cadereyta NL property.
A few hours before they were found, the military authorities had presented to the media 11 people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the final shot, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place 1.5 kilometers from Cadereyta road in Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed by this place observed that in the property, whose fence is beige and brown the gate was wide open.
Looking in at a depth of about 10 feet [3 m], they located the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, no shoes; next to him was another man with a white T-shirt, with straps.
A meter away was the body of another individual wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to the data obtained on site, the three people were killed in another location, as no casings were found on site.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized crime group to another, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense has presented 11 individuals, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta municipality and are believed to be involved in kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to published reports, in the first incident on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone, and they claimed to be part of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident that took place on November 12 at 06:00 am, military personnel made a surveillance tour in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without license plate with two subjects on board.
When the soldiers stopped and searched, they found a long gun, a magazine, and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Subsequently, and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape when he saw the military.
They are given clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The new Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of economic disaster.
The new Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The framework is now well drawn", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in less time than usual, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore trust in Italy that had been damaged.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability has pushed the yield on Italian BTP bonds to above 7% over 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers' Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would strongly support this government".
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success have been greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result", Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could trigger another devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organisations.
He'll finish his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief lull at the end of last week when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italy's debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over the new prime minister's success.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by experts, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties make it difficult to include political figures.
The Spanish experience is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, 10 have played in more than 50 international matches.
In Costa Rica, only one of the 22 sentenced to prison attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica, when you compare the 22 players from both countries for the friendly today, at 3:05 pm, at the National Stadium in San José.
While the national and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a large record of Class A inter-team games, the Tricolore only have defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international games.
This was achieved last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) over Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs in the English Premier League, maintain an intense activity in national league and cup championships and contests in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers for the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have limited international experience in one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish national team is that of the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defensive 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the Tricolore today and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the brains behind Barcelona, is 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other Iberian team centenarians, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke's striker Raúl González with 102.
Next up is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with [Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana, are left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances, and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
The ones with fewer: with more than 30 performances in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 attendances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of them don't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are yet to debut.
Spain's all-time leading scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the record holder with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best shows yet next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for over 20 years, but the band says that for them too, it will be a dream come true to perform in this country.
That's what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The band is on the South American side of their two-decade tour and on Sunday 20th will make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, alongside the Los Angeles band The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, Pearl Jam's performance in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensely the days before.
What's your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for sticking by us all these years.
It took us 21 years to get to Costa Rica, so thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry that it took so long to get to this concert.
Some people are already saying that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've put on in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We gave two huge shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it's put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to performing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, and Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world for both.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf, and that's how we learned it, from people who like to surf.
Seeing the tour, you've given huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan on doing for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never performed there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we'll try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never rehearse the repertoire.
What is the reason for this?
I think part of the reason is because we have nine records and we can perform over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to perform each night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all you've accomplished?
Yes, I certainly did.
First of all, I think none of us imagined that we were going to form a great rock band, and the fact that we've been doing it for over 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We continue to talk about our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together is very exciting.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be going to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental part in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great groups.
We're very close friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a movement starts out from a group of friends and is unusual.
Occasionally, a group emerges from a city, but it's much stranger when five or ten groups emerge from the same city at once.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to still be friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to be part of this Seattle sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours can stay together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that's a lot longer than most bands normally last.
First, I believe we are all lucky to be alive, and second, we all care about others.
We're all close friends and because of that there are music boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't get any better.
Your relationship with the word "celebrity" has not been easy, but your success has allowed you to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we got older, it became easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who like your music.
If you don't forget that people are here for music, it helps you remember that you have to respect music and what it has brought, not to think about the fact that you're famous and a rock star, which none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration with the fact that it lasted so short and the most important thing is the fact that we're still very good friends with Bruce and Greg who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music and football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yeah, the production sent us videos with different suggestions and this was the band we liked the most, so we're excited to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it should be very entertaining.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's lyrics live?
This is a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he does it with the first words he thinks of.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Some of the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge up despite the fact that it's out of fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the other bands that came out at the same time, and if it's relevant now, I think that's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that are classified as very dark songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that for me.
I also think that you can be happy and even then you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for loss of muscle strength in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various ailments, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four operations and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that he did not want it because he feels innocent.
He has had four operations for tongue cancer, has lost 18 pounds, and has other medical conditions, including severe erosive gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulation problems in his feet, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people in connection with an army extermination squad that operated underground during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highlight of a long agenda of meetings with political and business authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favorable for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries which continue to be tax havens, a statement which provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations by its ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chair of the G20, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, since November and has a treaty with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the OECD's grey list of countries that do not fully implement international standards for tax cooperation.
In trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004 that has increased trade in goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber goes three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land
Super Mario fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to stores this month, was designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to tell how the stereoscopy without glasses should work", Nintendo's press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, said during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this medium", as so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for fast and smooth play.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experienced players will be able to make a "second round" of the levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an aggressive D or one that only affects the depth of action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray into three-dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that had not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists of the mustachioed plumber having to travel through perilous minefields to free Princess Peach.

Colom approves the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that wanted Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and executive, taking into account that a lower court had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he had "not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given effect to all extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did is an executive step after exhausting all judicial and constitutional proceedings to try the former 2004-04 mandate holder.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after he has resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and after his human rights have been guaranteed.
Portillo was cleared of embezzling Q120 million from the Department of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the prosecution appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The entity was created to prevent the marginalization of untrained young people
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social support body are important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
In addition, the long-standing employment of this social group is now 100 years old.
The anniversary was marked yesterday by a celebration in a former Fabra i Coats industrial complex attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighbourhood in 1986 with the aim of helping people with low education, unemployment, drug addiction problems or marginalized.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of officials from entities and institutions that have worked with the association for 25 years.
The variety of political representation in the middle of the election season showed the unity of the work carried out by Trinijove.
The event was attended by the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-Socialist municipal councillor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of La Caixa's charity, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the Fabra i Coats grand hall.
Mas said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove as an example of how to fight against bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
'The crisis is not something new for the entity and the work it does,' he said.
Property overrun by squatters for micro-parties, evacuated
The intruders had taken 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
It seems that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Rue Balmes were living has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they were illegally occupying at noon yesterday and where they were throwing micro-parties that were desperating to the neighbors, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the situation from happening again.
"From this day on there will be access control", the administrator said.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical system and some of the water supply, as well as painting the walls and leaving behind residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcohol.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despairing tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that once the building was occupied, her business had fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club said that the burglars were being unfair to her because they were selling glasses for three euros, while in the club they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the club had to respond to neighbours' complaints about noise, while she said the trouble was not caused by the customers of the club, but by the occupants of the house and especially the participants in the parties held there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors in the area.
The manager of the club explained that the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and he "forgave" her for the past nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The chairman of the municipal group of the PP in the city, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of living together and civic life that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were also thefts.
In this sense, he added, "impunity must be ended and property-based antisocial behaviour must be relentlessly opposed".
Yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police moved to 35 Rue Montréal after receiving a call from a neighbor who observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the appropriateness of the call beyond the fee controversy
The municipal competition for the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), the administration printed posters to promote Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
It also contained a comparison, in numbers, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park is an advantage to this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars playing Yogi the Bear.
This was the case until the city council held a mega-competition in September of 16 entries for all the access doors to Collserola.
A doorway is a park, no doubt.
It's either that or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organisation and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient elite caste talk about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions that three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who presented themselves on the occasion, agree on.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after tackling the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech on green building blocks has not been completed.
"We must start from the fact that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it is very accessible.
Collserola is more complex', the architect said, adding that the title of 'Collserola's gates' was a 'lexi­cal trap': they should not be thought of 'as accesses to a park, but as the delimitation of certain areas in which action is needed'.
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The dangers arise from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience of the 1980s, which had its "swan song" in the Forum area.
The first fear is the very delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
"To limit something means to set the next step", that is, to go beyond it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP) ] can cause real disasters".
Moving on to the question, Modol thinks that, in a simplified way, the slope of the Collserola valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona's not".
Modol recalls that there is already work being done by the Collserola Board which "should not be lost", thanking the town hall for the opportunity it offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
He also feels that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the key to allowing architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams ("a success", he says) that have been created: "We architects should be only an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the basis of the competition lacks a global vision of Collserola: "We have called 16 cross-cutting competitions - he says - in the direction of the mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he has opted to participate in all 16 contests.
In other words, a design for one of the doors to clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the strip immediately above Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, a facility area that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of pre-trial detention, the legal power of the Casino Red granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 years in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal power of the Casino Red grants him a pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, following a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, posted a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded that he pay a financial fee to the mayor of Monterrey to allow the casino to operate clandestinely.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal case against the brother of the PANista mayor and on September 2 he was arrested and held in pre-trial detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of Public Prosecutor's Office's Property Offenses Officer 3, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued after the prosecutor's officer dismissed the corruption and organized crime charges.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center for allegedly blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention center because of death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonas' guilt, such as the one related to the receipt of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing it to operate.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and which of the gambling house's partners had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to reveal the name.
Under the 197/2011 case, Jonás Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and can no longer make any claims related to the trial against him; he will not be asked for any compensation for damages or any punishment.
After the hearing of the legal authority of the gambling house, at 3:50 p.m. Larrazabal Bretón was ordered to be released immediately.
The clerk of the court, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza Municipal Prison to inform Jonás that he had been pardoned legally and that his case would be closed.
He will also notify the judge of the order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven others
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) has reported that the results of the accident in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter struck directly into the ground with complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, said that before the plane took off, the pilot had checked that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"Evidence indicating that the unit had various contact with the ground, blades came into contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
He also said that the investigation into the impact zone did not report the appearance of any pieces on the ground.
"In one investigation it was reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact occurred structurally.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for carrying them.
The ground was inclined from seven to 30 degrees.
For the moment, the secretary has assured us that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible, but the investigation may take a few months, it may even take a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said the helicopter was operating at cruise speed and was on soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal cruise ship operation at the time of impact", he said.
During the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was performed according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate takeoff conditions, and as the aircraft advanced toward the DF-Mexico border area there were layers of low-altitude fog.
Routes selected:
It is likely that due to the foggy conditions the crew sought a lower altitude and better visibility area towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last radar record of the aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight, lateral trajectory.
The dispersion pattern of the aircraft debris suggests that the helicopter struck the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
We detected no signs of fire or explosion.
At the crash site there is still no sign in the wreckage of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest investigation indicates that the aircraft had multiple contact with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the ground inclined from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have dislocated during his journey.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough search of an area larger than the surrounding area, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene for obesity
Social Insurance is conducting an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, supported by specialists from the NIP
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, called the Protocol on Genetics of Child and Adolescent Obesity, which will allow for the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Biochemistry Research Unit at the Specialties Hospital of the 20th Century National Medical Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The public, whether eligible or not, is invited to attend the IMSS participating sports units in Valle de México, where the tests are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol started in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity will take place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the target of 500 or 600 miners, the study will continue in the Unidad Sportiva Independencia (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Unidad Sportiva Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the aim of this investigation was to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day is being celebrated on 14 November, he said the aim was to bring together 3,000 children and young people aged between six and 14 with the consent and supervision of their parents for the use of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes and kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays all participants will be subjected to anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetic tests (to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López said the investigation was prompted by health professionals' concern about the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 reported a 77 per cent increase in obesity among boys and a 47 per cent increase in obesity among girls in just six years, and a dramatic increase in overweight,' said the IMSS specialist.
He said the rationale for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American heredity, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetic cause of obesity is the inability to burn excess energy (calories) that is consumed, which is deposited as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which can detect whether they are overweight or obese.
Ila even says that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic changes and even prediabetes.
The information is kept confidential, and the doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are told about each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV most of the day, and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
Another cause is high calorie intake, i.e. higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - cornmeal meat paste wrapped in corn leaves, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the clogs
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signs of the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 paving stones each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who said that if the process of building and maintaining the tarpaulin is adequate, the paving stones could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his lecture A Technological Opinion on Crushed Stone, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he heads was developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar properties to asphalt but with greater mechanical strength at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and therefore the formation of cinders.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a combination of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight called asphaltenes, and molecules with a lower molecular weight called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that the asphalt strength on the streets is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineer.
The QF researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered with flexible paving, made up of six layers of material, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the little stones that make up the layer, he pointed out, is washed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating forces, it allows the forces to spread very well through the pavement.
If the asphalt was modified, the asphalt would spread better, the chemical engineer said.
"On the asphalt layer", he said, "they put a last layer called the rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt".
Since this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the bearing layer also requires that it be of adequate thickness and that the material of which it is made be carefully selected.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer and it is difficult for it to get out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and consequently causes the screeching.
In the process of formation of a ridge, he says, the first to break down is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of slopes and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement must always be related to the vehicle load and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent slopes.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to research and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow for the repair of the casings easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that prevented Melina Ramírez Serna from winning the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle receives her 14th princess title.
Once again Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the ribbon that credits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico won the crown and sceptre, the department has already won 14 titles of Princess and Melina, joining a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanca (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many people are asking today is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation has shown that she has everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain as the Queen of the Police and the Best Pretty Face of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to name her First Princess was the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What book has struck you and why?" posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer from the candidate from Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe quite a bit in literature, I believe it's a form of culturalisation, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is The Little Prince, it's a pretty profound book.
Now I am reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called The Blood Fever.'"
This answer was not pleasing, firstly because of the term "culturalisation" and secondly because it did not explain in concrete terms how each book cited had affected her.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for everyone else, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
One of the hypotheses is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the cheered-up and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster Food Challenge, the public vote for Best Craftsman Costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on stage".
And it was noted in her first bathing suit appearance at Hilton Beach and her two parades the night before her coronation.
Although she had appeared confident in both parades, it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter on the RCN Channel's "Como en casa" program, said that Melina's being named a princess "confirms that the candidate who gets the most awards during the contest does not receive the queen's crown".
Also, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That is why two days before the election international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before the contest begins she is already involved in projects", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his defects in his buttocks and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the 'Natural Beauty' candidate with healthier body, good diet and responsible physical work.
The trainer of queens Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her abdominal fibrosis, which I hadn't really noticed, left her with spots on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that the mistake of the Valle candidate was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"Surgery is good, but Valle didn't know how to do it.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that look".
For this award, which the National Beauty Contest is giving for the first time, after the swimsuit parade a cruel prediction came true last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo was giving to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Whether it's true or not, the truth is that Melina is starting a year of reign today, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international designation contests of the National Contest.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of the Cali person who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A Cali typist has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a typist from the Cali CTI went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the FARC supreme leader, "Alfonso Cano", by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of forensic investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the location of the bodies that were to be identified.
In 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the friction skin, that is, the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he and the investigative team arrived at the body, he didn't recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
With a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a probe and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints on the body with those on the map.
His eyes did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
Searching for the Footprints
For a typist from Sijín de Cali, the acknowledgement that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, fingerprint scanners support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of those caught.
When caught, many criminals show false identity cards or have no papers.
We're going to take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The investigator related that in one case he had to remove part of a wall of a house because the thief had reached out to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the entire hand and identify the offender who had participated in different thefts", he recalls.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently, a man was found dead, with liquor bottles around him.
The investigation concluded that a relative may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a print on the bottle matched.
Even if that doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him at the scene.
A typographer at the ITC explained that "fingerprints are taken from objects with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a tape or a tape is used to remove them.
Afterwards, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the decliners' database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers", said the ITC expert.
He explained that not everything is as it is shown on the television program CSI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch is necessarily imprinted.
It can, however, be used, if the necessary confrontation is made.
"Indignant" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were rushing to camp outside Zuccotti Square.
Many people complied with the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Occupy Wall Street activists defied New York City authorities on Tuesday by attempting to re-enter Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple, thanks to a court order.
Hundreds of protesters were rushing to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to enter thanks to a court order allowing the 'indignant' to camp there again, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp out in the square again, we will move to another place and continue the legal fight to get back to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests", said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the 'indignant' response to the evacuation of their camp personally ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg went all the way to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the camp and allowing the protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' have occupied a new park at the junction of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but afterwards the police moved in and arrested some protesters, although Bray could not confirm the exact number, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that hundreds of people had moved into the area, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in to show support for the movement and tried to intercede on their behalf before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned compound - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to discuss the legality of the evacuation this morning.
Some protesters who had moved there were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at that time and even handing it to officers guarding the square, which caused 'some small clashes,' Bray said, denouncing the fact that some officials beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing 'laws issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other property they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters because of the court order, but warned them that local laws do not allow them to move in with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the early morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were 'violating the law'.
Bloomberg said he ordered the evacuation because the square was becoming "a place where people came not to protest but to break laws and in some cases, to hurt other people", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The early morning evacuation was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in protecting financial interests than those of American workers", the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "failing to respect freedom of speech".
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they do not plan to hold "big actions" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two-month protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas television special
She will be featured alongside Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", lifeguard on "Baywatch", rabbit on "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will play the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside crooner Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today released footage of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet distribution of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee, is seen dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll in a manger that depicts Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently performed a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires in late March, and who is not far from controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during a concert in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% on domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the property damage at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global environment, seems to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the figures for Gross Domestic Product between July and September were a definitive turning point: GDP rose by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and by 6% on an annualized basis.
The second quarter - for Japan, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also represents the strongest growth rate since January-March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of the acquisition of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, firms increased their investment by 1.1%, compared with a 0.9% decrease in capital expenditure from January to March, the first decrease after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus to the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use deficits to grow from scratch.
Japan has been awakened mainly by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by higher expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has returned to the domestic market when the yen - Japan's currency - has become one of the "safe havens" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the uncertain forecast of the United States, a privilege that weighs heavily on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic buoyancy is determined by the health of the big tech groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, blamed the low performance between July and September on the yen.
While markets continue to operate in the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is not letting down its guard.
"We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the outlook is not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that forecasts the turning points in the world economy highlights the slowdown in the main powers.
Because it's down four decimal places to 100.4 points, down from 100.8 in August.
The euro area was even below the average, which is in the 100 level, falling by eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens again fuels doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Tories will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premia triggered and uncertainty re-established in the parks, Greece continues to get entangled in the maze leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the 'consensus' of the new Greek transitional government is being imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday signaled that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100 days period set in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he would not support the new austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated his demand for new elections on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit", Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed to assist the transitional government, but we have committed to nothing more".
The Conservative leader has gone one step further than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must unlock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Economic Affairs Committee, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of €8 billion, although there is no final date either.
The Greeks have a lot of work to do.
Queen Sofía: 'They are instruments for progress and hope'
The Queen stresses Spain's 'leading' position in this type of finance
"Spain has achieved a leading position in the world in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that over the past two decades the country has become the world's second largest donor of this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated the 5th World Microfinance Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very specifically, in the one that aims to halve the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, which is set at the "poverty line".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and takes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions launched during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "faced many challenges".
The Microfinance Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate but also as the platform from which to advance 'two basic goals'.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the objective is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that 100 million of these families will be lifted out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus for the concept of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path pioneered a few years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofía said as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the instrument's father as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of poverty eradication", whose work she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project earned him the title of "head of the family" yesterday from the "banker of the poor" in Valladolid.
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this respect, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to periods of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredit requires "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work in solidarity and not let it be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodriguez applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded from whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, went without any real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally included in the programme but became a priority in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow too lax.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes which Angela Merkel and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, received at the end of their speeches was no doubt.
The Chancellor's main idea - and the motion's - is based on a slogan: the answer to the crisis is not less Europe but more Europe.
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
The Chancellor said: "The time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty to increase the EU's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the European Commission President by universal suffrage "to give Europe a face".
This is at least one of the proposals in the motion adopted by the Congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is also hostile.
But the milestone is set.
The delegates also overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight each country's weight on the European Central Bank's board according to the weight of each economy, which of course would increase Germany's weight.
In an effort to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor made many references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she also did not seek to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in trouble that were quick to criticize arrogant Germany.
The motion on Europe has a paragraph on the importance of 'French-German friendship', but Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except when it's hollow.
It is a reminder that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is sick leave fraud?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the sick leave offensive.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and deliver a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of fighting social fraud and welfare.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save money in a context of rigorousness, but is no less indicative of a right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
Firstly, in order to save money: the government is planning to impose a fourth day's absence on private employees before taking over a work stoppage.
In short, without a specific agreement from the company, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
The move, which could provoke anger, would generate $250 million, according to Les Echos.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs.
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also revives the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuse related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will pay back", warned Xavier Bertrand to the microphone of RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of advertising seem somewhat out of proportion to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
Since 2002, it has been the subject of constant monitoring and political attacks, which have often borne fruit.
The French are no sicker than anywhere else in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, at €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% was for maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% was for sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And that's 2.5 percent of health care spending.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had never taken a day off from work due to illness.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was for less than 8 days, 22% for 8 to 14 days, 15% for 15 days to a month, 15% for one to three months and 11% for longer.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers are not more likely to stop working than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for health or not) ranged in France between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud of sick leave is very small compared to the work in the dark.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has made checks systematic on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 short-term stops were 'unjustified or too long', or 37 050 cases.
In the case of detentions of more than 45 days, which were systematically monitored, 11% of cases were 'unsuitable or unjustified' out of 1.2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169 000 cases were therefore "unjustified", out of several million employees who had taken sick leave.
This figure is very small compared, for example, to that of undeclared work.
According to Dominique Tian, MP for the UMP, who wrote a report on the issue in June, this would represent €9-15 billion in tax loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud of daily allowances.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to bring its economy back to life.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
"To continue the recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme", said the Prime Minister, who was giving his first public speech at the opening of the confidence vote debate in Parliament on Wednesday.
He said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the eurozone "is at stake".
As a result, Mr Papademos forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced to "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday backed the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said at a meeting with members of his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt and of combating waste but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
When Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalised, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, says report from Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9 percent of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
That is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts in various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where necessary, for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
To start off, experts cite a recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medical treatment of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
With or without medical care, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the wish of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6 percent of them end up dying in a hospital.
In Quebec, the highest rate of deaths in the country, 86 percent occur in hospitals.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors reach conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where such approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, that is, the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on unqualified or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, said Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a teleconference yesterday, more cases of such overflows are to be found precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legal.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85 percent of Canadians have already voted in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would alleviate the suffering of people at the end of life, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those who have been assisted suicide, 41 percent of those surveyed feel that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear-cut when it comes to whether to continue or stop care for a patient, say the authors of the report.
The Commission's proposal to amend the list of recommendations is to include in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of medical care for which there is a valid legal refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect refusal of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee called for it to be treated as euthanasia, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, and subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some health law experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Health law expert Pierre Deschamps called the position of the experts who signed the report "extreme", partly because it does not limit euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age could ask for help to commit suicide", says Deschamps, who read a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, he says, "in society, there are signs and restrictions".
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called "clearly pro-euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus exposes a "conspiracy" against the Syrian government
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the Foreign Ministry.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, with Russia's support, is resisting them and denouncing a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions on Damascus while Syria's neighbours Turkey and Jordan have taken a stand in favour of President Assad leaving.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria yesterday, where another 40 civilians and regime forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, a neighboring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said that Turkish mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the regime's actions" in Syria, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly tough line" on the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "in gunfire and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO said.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly condemned the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' work, which he called a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not bow down", he added, assuring that "plots against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to be sent to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said was locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the crisis resolution plan agreed on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities affected by the protests and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis resolution plan, while refraining from supporting any sanctions against Damascus.
The Commission
Monti wants time at the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, has asked for some time for the markets to form their team and implement a programme, which will include "sacrifices", to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today with the trade unions and employers.
He should set up a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a lot of sacrifice", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the President-designate of the Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti presenting a short list of ministers, probably a dozen or so, to the President of the Republic, Mr Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
He stressed that "in a democracy, there are specific deadlines" for preparing a government and its programme, saying he was "confident that the markets will be patient and understand".
The President's appointment was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern has reignited after an unexpected fall in euro area industrial production in September.
The Prime Minister-designate is expected to form a team that will mainly include technocrats, although he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti pledged, once he took office, to work with urgency and with the aim of Italy 'becoming a protagonist again' in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further austerity measures.
The Italian "bosses' boss" Emma Marcegaglia, who will meet him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country without growth cannot meet the deficit parameters".
Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconiism", with the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editors.
The big unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place €200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a US NGO specialising in nuclear risk said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, which draws heavily on IAEA documents, Mr Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s onwards at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk, Urals, and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company reportedly led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly cooperated in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was aided by the work of a foreign expert who not only had a good knowledge of the technique but who, as one member state informed the Agency, worked on the technology for most of his career within his home country's military nuclear programme".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or only slightly during the same period, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of crimes against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% overall increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628, with 47.3 percent of them motivated by racial differences and 20 percent by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses rise again", Human Rights First said. "The increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, a senior human rights official.
"The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses", he adds, saying that this could be done through improved police reporting on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence based on race, color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced changes to the layout of its platform on Monday, including allowing users to observe the activity of those they follow, making its service a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and a new "name" allow you to more easily follow, live, the activity of other "Twittos", the users whose messages you follow ("tweets") and who follows you.
This allows you to see if they're following up on messages, subscribing to new accounts, having favourite messages, etc.
The new Twitter feature was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its un-instinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to retweet someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the insiders happy, is opening up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users debated through tweets about the usefulness of this innovation.
"It's useless, intrusive, and it's too much like Facebook", wrote @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed", @dannykronstrom wrote.
The Commission
The new constitution introduces a budgetary "golden rule"
The ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democrat grand coalition government in Austria decided on Tuesday to insert a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution to reduce government deficits and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's sovereign rating by rating agencies (triple A).
The Socialist Chancellor Werner Faymann himself announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers meeting, when Austria's public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's credit rating were lowered by just one degree, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an extra three billion euros in interest each year", argued Christian Democrat Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following up on a request made at the summit of the euro area countries in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the reduction of public deficits and the return to balance of public accounts to be included in the constitution or in a law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The Austrian government's system is similar to the 'German model', as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the structural public deficit must decrease by 0.75% of GDP each year and, from 2017, the federal government's structural public deficit must not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities must present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
The yen is strong
No threat of further intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we find excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from its historic highs that prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold off massive amounts of yen against dollars to lower the value of Japan's currency, which had just set a new record for strength since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has steadily risen since then, spurred on by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in uncertain times of global economic downturn and the European debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
The rise in the Japanese currency is hurting the archipelago's exports by raising the cost of Made in Japan products and reducing the value of foreign earnings by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, Noda said, fearing that the rise in the yen will kill the fragile recovery.
The world's third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 percent from the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption by disaster-stricken households.
But the prime minister said the yen's rise in price did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day monetary policy council meeting on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuer increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5 trillion yen ($49.5 billion), raising the cap on the amount it can spend on purchases of various financial securities to 55 trillion yen ($59.5 billion).
The euro area:
The interest rates are rising, the stock markets are fading.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, European stock markets are sinking a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10am, the CAC 40 is down 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and the London Dax is down 0.1%.
"With new tensions on borrowing yields in the eurozone's struggling states, equity markets around the world continue to return some of their recent gains".
"Investors are too nervous to know the risk of contagion", says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed fears among market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, is watching Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of fluctuations until investors have proof that the situation is stabilized", said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the eurozone is penalizing the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it backtracked after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party, meeting at a congress on Monday, passed a motion including the possibility for a struggling country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and that on Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the stakeholders.
The future head of the Italian government Mario Monti has asked for time for the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened with suffocation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that implementing the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Looking ahead to euro area growth
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised down the second quarter figure, with a decline of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And this is actually the fourth thing that most worries economists.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas
If there is one subject which cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is good that an election is an opportunity to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be successful if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
With 7 billion people on the planet, population change will cause the demand for electricity to double by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be addressed in order to continue to produce electricity on a permanent basis, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to the need to find an alternative source of energy capable of replacing itself, or in Switzerland, which is simply building the latest generation of power stations.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name a few, are pursuing their plans with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their fleet by resuming construction of a power plant that was stopped after the Three Mile Island accident.
The German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, but the reality is quite the opposite.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependency aggravated by increased reliance on imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a jump in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal-fired power stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is worthy of consideration.
Europe's champion in wind power, from which it gets 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittent wind, so its CO2 emissions and electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not express any opposition to this energy in principle, polls show.
We should recall that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to create an industrial sector with 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 indirect jobs.
It is a major exporter, attracting a galaxy of SMEs specialised in international markets and making them very productive of jobs that cannot be relocated.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear power, it would be sacrificing many of these SMEs by reducing the €6 billion in annual exports of French nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for 60 years when the manufacturer's decline was scheduled?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no such thing as a miracle power source, nor is there a diabolical one.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have a safety authority in France which exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power stations, such as the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In the last half century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, was operated under normal operating conditions and was left without human or environmental impact.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the two previous ones.
The result of this approach and cooperation between safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR is designed to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electrical engineers who want to build a power station, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to Areva's and EDF's competitors by giving them the opportunity to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvering dominate a debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - overcrowding of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of numbers, compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a "land of human rights".
More recently, the administrative harassment of foreign students has been in the news, with the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and waiters".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The reason is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with almost 2 million migrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the left and the right.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity shown to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to trivia, saying that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally rewarding; but it is economically very costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in their recent book Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration is anemia, growth and employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may replace domestic workers, especially low-skilled ones, putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary than substitute for national workers, mainly in jobs in sectors where there is a shortage of jobs.
Low skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not keep up with job supply.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity between nationals and migrants makes the arrival of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows would lead to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real wages in the long term.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, an immigrant reaching the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of €150,000 to public budgets on average over his lifetime.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, we must think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, having invented it in Athens over two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the right to vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We have known since Napoleon the Younger that this was a matter of easy thinking.
The universal suffrage, if it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and above all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum has been a double-edged sword in this respect: the need for a strong political comeback, but also the disturbing sense of its impossibility, its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought through to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organised as necessary and in a dispersed order.
The European Parliament has a duty to ensure that the European Parliament is able to take part in the negotiations.
No, we do not want blankets but a common, full-fledged, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - and we would not know where to stop the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is being dictated to by the markets and the rating agencies, which is suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
There is concern about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent need is to restore popular sovereignty to the European project.
Because together Europeans can reduce their debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless of course they lead to disaster.
After a long struggle against the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for a European economic government.
I mean, either way.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be another madness and another dead end.
We must take on a new stage in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not be enough.
That lesson is still valid.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on a political level, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
We must make Europe, we must make Europeans.
Contactless smart cards are becoming widespread
The World Smart Card Fair opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in a climate of optimism.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in the global sales of micro-processor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones, etc.), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most prominent segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or pay for purchases by simply approaching the card reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million the year before.
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (expected to reach 580 million) and to account for almost 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground for contactless payments.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards already have this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the start was more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were deployed.
But the large areas are double the bite.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To move to the next speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French banks have committed to providing their customers with contactless cards in the future", says Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology necessary for transactions.
"They were late".
"But they should finally see a real boom next year".
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a trial from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Societe Generale, too, said yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer that would allow its customers to pay without contacting their mobile phones.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the Terrorist Front Spreads
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected links between the Islamic Maghreb terrorist group al-Qaeda (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algeria had now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation", he said without elaborating.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has reportedly uncovered a number of breaches.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqim and were to be killed the next day along with several of their captors in an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the raid, French and Nigerian investigators were to recover several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls points to several callers based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has been living in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward but we probably need to wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"It has been known for years that the sect has financial and intellectual support from outside and is becoming increasingly active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this "support" has been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and discourse or in its methods of operation, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or increasingly complex and similar explosive devices to those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has pressed Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of illustrious people of little interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" in Hausa - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is rapidly gaining ground.
It is politicised and demands strict adherence to Sharia law while its activists wage a struggle against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily targeted at churches, bars, administration.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, with more attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, no-nonsense.
The army is surrounding the city. We have 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, captured alive, is killed in prison.
The sect will then radicalize and leave its northern strongholds.
Last Christmas, it claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked the secure police headquarters in Abuja in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local UN headquarters will be his first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia and then through Nigeria is now a concern for all security experts.
While Aqmi has invested in Mali and Niger, and Somali al-Shabaab operates in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are competing for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters might believe that.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been making loud statements and taking shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
The slogan of China, Iran and aid to Israel was often unfounded.
Mitt Romney, the front-runner for the nomination from the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and charge them with "manipulation of their currency", a common theme in an America angered by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
He said that it would be worse if it meant a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost choked himself to death over an attitude that "flatters" emotions.
He called for a vigorous but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, stagnating in the depths of the polls, remains unheard.
Like Reagan did
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran", he boasted.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
The second best candidate, entrepreneur Herman Cain, shows a shameful lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has had a military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We're a long way from the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had simple ideas too and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and had to add water to his wine when it came to counterterrorism.
They rightly insist that his naïve dialogue with Iran has failed, that the boys from Iraq have left too quickly, that he has been procrastinating in Libya, and that he is a weakling.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public has a rather positive view of Obama's national security record, which eliminated bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to stalemate.
And, by arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes a more correct line.
Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which links Western Europe directly to Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas to the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a bang.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the Nord Stream pipeline, which links Russia directly to Germany under the sea, on the shores of the Baltic Sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year via a first 1224 km pipeline linking the St Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is due to be completed by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all the gas consumed in France.
And there is already talk of building a third on the same course.
For Gazprom, the completion of this huge project on time looks like a victory.
The project had been strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
The two countries are losing some of their power, and it is becoming harder for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to cut off access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But this is at the cost of a weakened energy Europe, since the project has created a rift between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavy consumers of gas and whose deposits are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us organically", Fillon said at the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom executives, who are present in large numbers at Lubmin, the gas terminal.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of steel and covered with concrete to protect it from the anchors of the ships.
It rests on the seabed, 200 meters on average.
The construction of the tunnel was to avoid minefields from World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Moreover, more measures have been taken to protect the flora and fauna.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is uninterrupted on its entire length by anything: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off Sweden, but the project was abandoned when the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company permanently established off their coast.
"If there is a malfunction, we stop the gas flow in less than a minute", says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline is therefore released into the air.
But this is considered unlikely by the builders who have planned the welds to leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the condition of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, towed by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus which circulates inside the pipeline.
It is shaped like a cigar, is inserted into a tube, one meter wide, and is pushed by the gas.
When it arrives, after three full days of travel at a speed of 10 feet per second, it delivers accurate information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without any repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
It's 200 bars to go, 100 bars to go.
Five companies joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader is still Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Germany's E.ON and BASF joined the group (15.5% each), as did Gasunie from the Netherlands and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased all gas transmission capacity to this company for a renewable period of 20 years.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The construction of the pipeline was financed 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to be EUR 7.4 billion for the two pipelines.
For example, GDF Suez invested 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure to recover their costs, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
The gas outlet is formed by 15 foot high valves.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the incoming gas before it is transferred to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a name tag.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine aims to bring back the taste of writing.
It smells like adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its broken white leaves, as if aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a distinguished but design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of launching the new product.
The booklet is based on an old production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought back to life an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12,7 million units sold.
We are a long way from the secret production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw a picture of the buyer, because the notebook appeals to businessmen, students and professionals alike.
Like Moleskine, his customers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, has grown to almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city centre and has managed to impose her identity.
"We have kept up with the times and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer cases... The brand is available in a range of supports.
A success that made envious: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for disabled people begins today.
Despite a voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is still twice the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Discouraging ?
"No", says Eric Blanchet, executive director of the Adapt, the association that organizes the Employment Week for the Disabled".
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high but three times as high".
"But there is still a lot to do".
It must be said that for the unemployed disabled there are still many obstacles to access to employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 years old (an average of 17%).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10 000 are disabled.
Finally, longterm unemployment is widespread: 53% for disabled people, compared with 38% on average.
In short, all these factors make it particularly difficult to return to work, and they "are the root of the problem", says Christian Grapin, managing director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for the objective brakes.
The fact remains that the mentality is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneur for the City association indicated that managers surveyed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% for disabled workers, set in a law of 1987.
The latest known figures, from 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at about 3 percent", says Pierre Blanc, executive director of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law.
The evidence is that the number of 'taxed' establishments, as well as the amounts paid, fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, put a lot of pressure on companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What a pleasure"
Before the match against the Blues on Tuesday evening at 20:45, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they have in this friendly match.
We won't even go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after the gesture of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise to say about him.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to go forward", assures the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his club and national team performances, he explained: "It's a whole".
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"I need to get my marks".
Hazard is scheduled to play Romania on Friday night in the match against France.
But we must not omit the concept of "pleasure".
He has been cheering for the Blues since he was seven and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive", he says.
This inevitably contributes to reinforcing the 'special' character of this meeting.
He said that the opposition was "very much against Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ".
"We just ran into each other".
"To be able to play against them is a joy!"
Leekens, for his part, spoke with good humour of "pride".
"Pride" of playing "a gala match".
"Proud" to note - as a "neighbour" - that France has "become a very high-level team again" a little over a year after the Knysna trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a thunderous job", he exclaimed.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician will be sharing the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing up", he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll see in the next few games, including the one against France".
Portugal is very confident
Portugal under Paulo Bento is starting with a lot of optimism in their return game against Bosnia at 22:00 on Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams were unrealistic.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been at the helm since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and one opponent, Bosnia, to beat.
With the first leg 0-0 on Friday in Zenica's hell, it's obvious that the games are not over.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, but they were unable to score that valuable goal that would have relieved them.
"It's a good result, but it comes with some risk because we didn't score on the outside".
But at their bright home stadium, the Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident of passing in front of a crowd that should be equally hot, even though the game is obviously going to be "very close", says an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close game, but we are absolutely confident we can take the lead", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw reported on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
One no-show is enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it comes with some risk because we didn't score a goal on the outside", Bento regrets.
"We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the outset so as not to "give them time to think".
That's a good idea, as long as you're realistic this time.
