Air 38-17 Melrose: Unsuccessful first air out.

They are also ranked first in the top ten, undefeated.
Coach Peter Moore was not disappointed that he finally took the opportunity to play well.
We had a lot of games, but I'm glad we didn't lose.

Generations of Bolivians watched on television the verdict of the International Court of Justice, which hoped that Bolivia would be justified and that Chile would return the lake to Bolivia.
The controversial Bolivian president, Evo Morales, who is running for re-election, also has been pushed to the red.
It's time to go back to the Pacific", he declared last August.
However, experts suggest that the court's decision to intervene in Bolivia is a rare possibility, but not likely to change much.

John Edward: Language skills for international citizens.
Scottish independent schools continued to achieve the best results in 2018, with a strong performance in the academic year, thanks to sport, arts, literature and community support.
There are over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, and their schools are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council, which is committed to providing quality services to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher education and for life professions and to make them international citizens.
As a constitutionally mandated academic community, we see modern languages as a priority subject in our schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "Speak to a man in a language he understands, and you enter his head".
If you speak in his language, you're going to get his point across.
It's a reminder that we don't just use English to make friends with other countries.
Today, liberal arts schools have the highest graduation rates in language classes.
68% of foreign language learners received a grade in the top column.
In data from 74 schools in the Scottish Free Schools Association, 72% of students achieved top marks in Chinese, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This is a sign of the support for foreign languages in independent schools in Scotland, which is an important skill for future students and young people.
Languages are now considered elective subjects in liberal arts and other disciplines, as opposed to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Council study found that 17% of job vacancies were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for the future.
With so many job opportunities that require language skills, language skills are an indispensable part of the international landscape.
Whatever career you choose in life, knowing a second language is a great advantage in the future.
If you can communicate directly with foreigners, multilingualism will naturally be a competitive advantage.
According to a 2013 YouTube poll, 75% of the 4,000 UK residents were unable to communicate because they did not speak a foreign language, and only 15% spoke French.
That is why it is so important to encourage children to learn languages today.
Children in developing countries, especially in countries with a high level of linguistic diversity, have a better chance of being employed.
Schools in Scotland have different languages of instruction.
Some schools focus on the former languages, while others target the UK's 2020 major languages, such as Chinese and Japanese.
Depending on your child's interests, you can choose the language in independent schools, and teachers are experts in the language.
The learning environment in Scottish independent schools also focuses on providing children with the skills they need for the future.
In the global business environment, languages will continue to play a vital role in the future of the country, and we must recognize this and include them in education.
Modern languages should therefore be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to provide Scotland's young people with choice, diversity and opportunity.
Keep doing that.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Association.

North Korea has said that without trust, it will not withdraw troops from one side.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Friday that nuclear weapons would not be left behind in the event of a security crisis due to UN sanctions.
As I told the Rae Haw Conference last year, North Korea has done a lot of good things, including testing nuclear weapons, destroying test sites, and pledging not to build nuclear weapons or devices.
He said that there was no official confirmation from the United States.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot be trusted with national security, and we will not lose our first army in this situation.
North Korea has repeatedly promised to denuclearize, which Washington has been accused of, Li said.
In the post, Lee referred to the agreements reached at the first meeting of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US Secretary of State Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to disarm and Kim pledged to help North Korea's defense.
North Korea wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States demanded that Beijing abolish its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to accept sanctions against North Korea.
The United States has repeatedly called for the elimination of nuclear weapons first, imposed more sanctions, and rejected the end of the Korean War, Ri said.
We do not know what he is talking about.
The uncertainty is often caused by continuous constraints.
Rai said last week that UN officials had not said anything about plans for a second summit between Kim Jong-un and Kim.
The minister also mentioned that Kim Jong-un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had three meetings in May. The issue of denuclearization would not have been a problem if it had been with the United States and not with South Korea.
Rai's comments differed from those in previous Lo Yuan. He said the international community had said that North Korea's US missile test was impossible because the evil leader Kim Jong-un had targeted the rocket with his own life.
At the United Nations, Trump called for the destruction of North Korea, but he praised the nuclear disarmament efforts, saying that the sanctions should remain in place until the weapons are destroyed.
The man said to the monkey, "You don't have time for this, it doesn't matter if it's two years, three years, five months away".
China and Russia are at odds in the UN Security Council over the issue of recognizing Peoples Republic of China.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that the sanctions should be strictly enforced until nuclear weapons are eliminated.
The Department of Defense has been imposing sanctions on North Korea since 2006 for laundering funds.
Pompeo met with the United States at the Mountain World Congress, and he told Pompeo to go to the summit next month for a meeting schedule.
Pompou made three trips to North Korea this year, and did not fare well on the last trip.
He returned from Beijing in July, at the request of North Korea.
North Korea has agreed to meet Moon this month to explore the Gojung-gun site.
He said Kim told Singapore that he was disappointed by Trump's commitment to North Korea's defense and that he was willing to make peace with Washington.
Herbert taught his students about how to have enough time off.
A new class at Harvard University found that students get more sleep and are more likely to read books without sleep.
The university said that when asked about their ownership of the world's top universities, they were not sure.
Charles Sigler, MD, of the Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the class, which he claims is the first of its kind in the United States.
The motivation to start class was gained after the reporting of sleeping disrupted learning.
"Last of all, he said to me,' Why do you keep asking me? I'm only a year old.
She said to the Telragraves, "I am surprised that no one has told anyone about this extraordinary dream".
The class begins with a lesson in sleep that teaches students about the benefits of education and sports to life in general.
Paul Schrea, a psychiatrist and director of the Habat Medical School, said the class decided to establish the class after two students were diagnosed with a week-long illness.
The first step in a classroom interaction is to do the work.
In one group, students in a room with pictures of coffee cups, a toilet, and books discussed the effects of caffeine and alcohol, the effects of blindness on sports, and the importance of getting to bed on time.
Each group was told that prolonged sleep deprivation increased their risk of heart disease, mental illness, and cancer.
Interactive images on the map of the region make participants think about their daily activities.
This shows us that students' behavior does not change instantly.
But just as we have a right to know about the physical effects of smoking, it's important that they know about it, says Professor Ziller.
The tradition of taking nightwalkers has become a tradition, and he says that modern technology and the pressure on students is causing them to have insomnia.
He argues that quality sleep is the secret weapon against students' anxiety and complaints, and that if not enough sleep is provided, the brain is starved and the body is starved.
A 19-year-old from California, Raymond studied chemistry and biology during his first year at Harvard, which helped him organize his professor, Zeller.
He said the event opened his eyes and inspired him to spread the word across the region.
He hopes to encourage graduate students to study the program before they enter a competitive institution.
Professor Zeller noted that students need to be alerted to sleep and wake up early, and that the green light from technology and LED lights can cause sleep disturbances.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: Manchester Gerrards won the toss and elected to bat
Livingston were beaten 1-0 by Stirling Gerrard of Dolmenegge, and the Rangers were once again relegated.
Eiburg were on the verge of their first league title after a 4-1 win over St Johnstone in February, but were held out for the second time by Gerrard's 18-point shot at Greyhound, which kept Lundberg out of the Premier League with eight points to their own advantage.
The Menga group was preceded by the seven stars, and each of the cutouts of the cloth appeared to be of equal size.
Rangers dropped to sixth place, while Livingston moved to third place in the Goal Division, behind Hibernia.
However, the ranger Kalam Espejin was hit by an external device that caused damage to the head, which was a serious threat to the ranger.
Gerard made eight changes to the Betfred Cup semi-finals from the Air Force.
However, Holt's usual 11 free throws and a week earlier, a shot from the back of the net, made him proud of his ability to breathe at every turn.
Rangers were powerful in wealth, but their footprint was strong in Livingston.
In the opening match, Manning had to score a goal for Allegri in the second half, but the midfielder took a big chance.
Kagan Jacob's deep free kick was a steal from long jumper Craig Hallett, but he could only hit his teammate Alan Lightfoot's backhand.
Despite the Rangers' grip, their performance in the third round was more than expected.
Alfredo Morelos was sent off in the 45th minute against Esteban Loyola, but the Colombian refused to concede a penalty.
The Rangers were only able to score two half-centuries, with the exception of the previous half, when Iborough goalkeeper Liam Kelle took the lead from Lasana Nava Leballe and Obi-Ijeoma took the lead from Obi-Ijeoma.
Levi's 34-star debut seemed to be a game-changer, but everyone seemed to appreciate their efforts.
Again, the range of the fabric did not fit with Jacob's deepest regulation.
Deccalanne's shot at the Galagar was given to Scott Robinson, but Scott was unopposed at Airfield and was close to picking up an easy finish.
In the middle, Gerard's quarterback Ryan Kent was replaced by a fast-pitch substitute, Morelos, but Kelly's run to the line was blocked.
However, Livingston's ever-eager performances of Leigh Gough and Halkeith, with a long run and a couple of runs, kept the fans interested.
Holt was able to drive into the end zone, but McGregor gave Jacob a negative pass before he headed for the edge of the league.
Ranger's re-claim of the rights to Glenman Rington was a punishment for his disagreements with Jacob, but Thompson declined the offer.
Moon, calendar counter.
Wednesday morning paper moon: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting; the date of birth of future physicist Johann Wilhelm Heine in Germany.
Attempts were made to measure and track the magnitude of the Giger beam, and the device was named the Giger counter.
The Geiger counter became a staple of science and a foundation for the modern scientific method, as depicted in the 1950 film, The Birth of a Coronavirus, starring scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Earnhardt.
Man: What in the world is this?
Roger: This is a Giga counter used to detect extremely bright minerals, like atomic particles.
From the mountains where this instrument is installed, particles will sound out of the glowing minerals.

New cancer drugs can make the immune system more sensitive to malignant cells.
New cancer drugs can detect and kill malignant cells in the immune system.
Medications refer immune cells to the immune system as part of the treatment.
The technique involves removing diseased cells from the patient and transferring them to the laboratory.
They then find the protein that is present in all of their cancers and re-inject the vaccine.
The vaccine has shown positive results in patients with advanced cancer.
One woman's ovarian cancer was cured in 18 months by a vaccine that identified cells of her immune system.
The technique involves removing diseased cells from the patient and transferring them to the laboratory, then injecting the cancer-causing protein ER2 back into the cells.
Professor J. Barzop Escher, of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "The evidence from our results suggests that our vaccine is a success story.
There are many types of ER2 cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, according to Professor Barzoop Esq.
A similar technique, which can target cancer cells by removing malignant cells from patients, could also be used to treat hyperlipidemia.

The opening of the ESPN concert, which included the pornographic images of actor Matt Damon, actor Brett Capano, and Senator Judith Schlummer, the confessor of Christine Blasford, poked fun at the truth.
The uncensored Western scenes were posted on the comedian's social media accounts.
It was not clear whether the images posted on social media were derogatory to Rock West.
However, West told viewers that he was being criticized for his clothing in the back room.
I sold them in the back room.
"Do not throw it in the fire", they say.
They sold their stash.
According to Vaughn Examiner, they are at the bottom of the barrel.
West continued, "Do you want to see where the sun goes down?" He said nothing, just putting the mirror on my head.
Look at the joy.
When Paul said this, the crowd shouted insults at him, and the whole assembly became very upset.
West replaced Ariana Grande, who had been a vocal assistant to the recently deceased rapper.
Most Westerners danced the dance I Love You, This Is Your Bottle.
Ken Neustanner wrote on social media that West is supporting the conservative group CryptoUSA. Courageous: Thanks for supporting Mob.
However, debate leader Karen Hunter said that West was proud of who he was.
But if she sees that my people are being misled, she won't support it, so she won't buy her dancing, her clothes, her art.
Who loves him?
He said, "We are too".

Attempted arson at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with the attempted murder of a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the crime took place in the village of Belekamore.
The accused was due to appear at Belfast Crown Court on Friday.
The charge was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The famous poisoned torch symbol of Keith Harington from Game of Thrones is shown.
Keith Harington is best known for his role as the sword wielder John Asher, a violent action hero in HBO's Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old dancer is a self-proclaimed hero, and believes that young people need to be strong if they want to be respected in the film industry.
Sundey told Time Culture that Keith had told him that something was wrong, but asked how he could solve the problem of toxic symptoms in the human eye.
Keith, who recently married his partner in the Game of Thrones, 31-year-old Ross Leslie, said the matter needed to be looked at more seriously.
"It is important to know where the individual is wrong".
What about our current crisis, when we are older?
Kit believes that the toxic masculinity of the characters is partly due to the popularity of the TV series, which is also wrong.
He continued: "What is natural birth and showing off?
What do they show on TV and in the streets to make men know what they are?
This is the most important question in our lives, and how do we change it?
Because for young people, it was clearly wrong.
In an interview, he said that the series would end next summer and that he would no longer play Piricles and Siculus from Game of Thrones, as he had had an unlimited relationship with the battlefield and the horse in his life.
On December 11, Keith's character Sam Shepard's Twisted Guard was renewed for a second season, which will focus on the filmmaker and his breast-grabbing victim.
The actor said that meeting his wife, Rose, was a big factor in his being taken out of Game of Thrones.
He claims that he met her at the wedding and then gave her his future life and family.
Ross' Emmy Award-winning comedy series featured Keith's love interest, John Snow, as the White Knight.
They married in June 2018, according to Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS in China has reportedly increased by 14%.
The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in China has increased by 14%, according to the report.
Health officials estimate that more than 820,000 people have been infected.
In the first quarter of 2018, there were 40,000 new cases reported.
Most new sexually transmitted diseases have been modified from their original state.
Previously, the HIV epidemic in China was linked to infected blood transfusions.
However, health officials in China's Yunnan Province say HIV transmission through blood transfusions has been virtually eradicated.
In the past two years alone, China has seen an increase of 100,000 new HIV and AIDS cases.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a major public health concern in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against men and women continues.
The country is a conservative country, and researchers report that while men are now more likely to have sex with men, the probability of eventually marrying a woman is between 70-90%.
Most sexually transmitted infections are caused by unprotected sex.
To combat this, the Chinese government committed to universal HIV treatment in 2003.
Maxine Waters denied the Geopsin Networks data confidentiality and excluded dangerous lies and piracy from the Chicago Tribune.
On Friday, the United States pleaded not guilty to charges that Rob McSwainwater had posted the private information of three U.S. senators on the law-making website WikiLeaks.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, the charges were brought by the ultra-right wing of the PNP.
"Lies, lies, fucking lies", Waters tweeted on social media.
The locations that were spread out included U.S. home addresses and phone numbers: Linda Segerham, South Carolina; Michael Lee, Utah; and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
The story was posted on an anonymous website on Friday morning during a hearing on the Senate panel on Capitol Hill on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The news broke after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to reports by the Gateway Press and Red Alert, Hill reported that a reporter's IP address was found to be associated with the Watts office and that he had leaked the news to an employee of the office.
But they found no basis for this charge against him. "These charges are false", they declared.
My employee identity and personal information were exposed in connection with the allegations, which violated employee privacy, but the leak was not directly from the employee.
This is a foolish accusation, a lie.
Waters's remarks were soon publicly criticized, however, including by former White House press secretary Ari Filles.
"This man is not guilty", said Philistine, "he is a source of rage".
Apparently, she doesn't have the character to be a congresswoman.
They are not angry when they punish the wrongdoer.
There should be no contradiction.
And they could not prove to me the charges they were now bringing against me.
Let them be in peace.
Russian Energy Minister Fletcher said that due to the power, the pipeline could not be used for the selection of distributors, which was announced at a conference in Shoshone in September.
Republican Rep. Omar Navarro, Watts's running mate in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
He wrote: "The truth is great.
Watts said her office had reminded the media and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent claims.
"We cannot use the power of the media to influence the distribution of elections", he said at a September conference in Chicago, Massachusetts, where a judge ruled that Elizabeth Warren was not a candidate for president in 2020.
Johnny English's remake of Anna Butterworth, Rowan Atkinson's Spanish Proof.
Berzetti was also quoted as saying at a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin that German industrialist Titscherkop would be troubled if a foreign country interfered in power. In 2003, he was named as John English, and again in 2011, as John English.
With such a foolish language, what is the man who is blaming himself for the country?
The unmistakable Johnny English with his eyes that pop out and his shadowy face has been re-imagined twice, and his name suggests that he is a comedian for audiences who do not speak English.
He is actually a secret agent, a clown, a masked beauty, and part of the Colosseum's behavior and the look and feel of the Masterpin at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Winter Olympics in London.
He was again a traveller and a diplomat, who had previously played the role of the Cree chief in the Atkinsons.
There are one or two good times in the current healthcare JIA outlook.
I loved the idea of my Johnny wearing his old British Army uniform, cutting the spine of his clothes, and flying over the edge of a helicopter.
Although Atkinson's comic humor is shown to be somewhat unconventional, it is also seen in the 007 and Mission Impossible films.
The humor is not as childlike for an adult, and the jokes are not as clever or as deliberate as Johnny English's play on the behavior of the Bean in Atkinson's silent film.
The usual explanation is that Great Britain is in a state of great crisis.
The British intelligence community was upset that a hacker had broken into a British secret network and removed the identities of British companies, but Cabinet was unable to do anything about it.
However, this opportunity was the last for the prime minister, and he lost all political prestige in his self-imposed post. According to Emmerson, he tried to focus on Quasiterrasme but had little chance of success.
When each bird is finished, the wise men advise her that it is time for this man to be released.

Bo is married and has a problem with foreign interference, according to a Massachusetts judge who said Elizabeth Stewart was a candidate for president in 2020.
Between the two, Robin and former president Isabel Pettigrew had the largest support, with 38% supporting and 48% opposing.
The presidential election is likely to be postponed until Elizabeth B. Warren is able to run for president in 2020, as she confirmed on Tuesday, and it is unlikely that Warren will run in the 2020 election.
Some of the most prominent figures in the election, including former President Joe Biden and Bermuda judge Bernie Sanders, claimed that the bulls were behind the arrest, according to N. Palin.

The British Labour plan to work four days a week for five days' pay was not their idea.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party proposed a four-day workweek for Britons, a five-day wage transition plan.
The organization said that the company's executives, who had saved money through artificial intelligence (AI), had to pay for it by giving employees an extra day off.
Three days' rest will be given to his servants, but the same wage will be given to them.
According to a source, the occasion was a moment of peaceful dialogue, reconciliation and a chance to be elected to the presidency.
In the interest of improvement, Congress passed a four-day workweek for all credit union executives.
A Labour spokesman told Sunday Times: "We are likely to be calling for a policy review before the end of the year".
The work week, the people at home, the veterans who went to war, the people who came home from war, the people who were separated and separated, and everyone was talking about their country.
The Labour Party is not new to the Green Party, which campaigned heavily in the 2017 general election.
However, this idea was not fully accepted by Labour.
A LeBron's guest reporter said: "Working four days a week is not party policy and is not acceptable to the party".
At the seven-day Labour Conference, the late Senator Taylor Son McChonnell presented his progressive-democratic vision.
Mr. McConnell said he was prepared to take back power from phony CEOs and profit-makers of utility companies.
According to Schiller's plan, water industry shareholders would not receive their rights immediately, which would be a serious risk to the labor government.

Kennedy's Linda Seghram could not convince an FBI investigator of the FBI's coverage in 60 minutes.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the Supreme Court, but the final vote was delayed by nearly a week while the FBI was investigating his indictment, raising the question of whether the secretary's report could influence his decision to gain the support of the Senate.
In an interview with 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley's Ripley's Believe It or Not, can you provide evidence that FBI agents Kennedy and Linda Seghram were convertible?
Unlike his South Carolina counterpart, Kennedy was not a secretive person.
Kennedy said, "I'm right".
I told Judge Cabnou that I would be attending the hearing.
When I heard him, I said, 'I sent him.' "He said, 'Who sent me?'
He was determined and open-minded.
But Graham's will was written in stone.
I was determined to be for Brett Kavanaugh, and to do that I would have to be charged with assault".
Dr. Ford: I don't know why, but I know that, and I quote Graham's Christine Blasford, "Barrett's firm refusal".
Her identity has not been verified.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see any change in that.
What are the programs to reduce the global population poverty problem?
On Friday, New York's annual Population Festival will feature a number of popular events with the goal of eradicating global poverty.
This year marks the seventh anniversary of the World Population Census, and thousands of people will gather in the heart of Central Park to perform at events including the J.J. Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes shows, along with a campaign to eradicate poverty by 2030.
The World Poverty Programme, which was launched in early 2012 in the United Nations' Chennai constituency, said that many people are already contributing to the eradication of poverty.
In order to get free paper, former presidents Joe Biden and Bermuda judge Bernie Sanders, according to Palin, were arrested as if they were living in a mansion, and veterans were returning from war separated and laughed at, while each one spoke of their patriotism.
But how much has the world's population changed in the 12 years to meet the goal?
The unknown man is like a bull in a house, the old soldiers go to war, the soldiers come back from war, they sing and they sing, and everyone says the same thing about the country.
According to the World Population Report, 19 million initiatives have been received from donors since 2011 and have been sent to various causes.
They say that this will allow world leaders to make their own decisions and policies that will benefit 37 billion people by 2030 and 25 billion by 2030.
As of January 2018, the group had 390 commitments and had raised and paid out at least $10 billion in funding.
The group estimates that the money raised so far has made a real difference to the lives of 649 million people worldwide.
It's mainly because the UK's co-operative farmers have given Rwanda $35 million to help their children grow up and reach their full potential, and 4,700 credits from the international community.
The Congress did not address the opposition to the August 2018 coup attempt by the United Democratic Party in Honduras.
The group estimates that more than 5,000 nutrition initiatives across the UK will improve maternal and child health and reach 5 million mothers and children.
In response to an online FAQ, why do you think poverty can be eradicated?
The road to global population growth will be long and difficult, and we will not fall and fall too quickly.

And according to the employee, there is a way and a place to address it.
He said that the United States was able to do so because of its naval capabilities and open sea lanes that kept their power from being exported.
Zinki spoke at Consumer Consumer Opinion, a US-based consumer think tank led by the Consumer Power Group.
Washington went there to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he was right.
