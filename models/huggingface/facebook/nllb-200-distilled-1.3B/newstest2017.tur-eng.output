28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall earlier this week.
However, the victim's brother said that he did not think that anyone would want to harm him, saying: "In the end, things were going well for him".
The San Francisco Coroner's Office says the body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning has been identified as that of 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department says the cause of death is determined to be homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told KGO, an ABC station in San Francisco, that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, got his dream job six months ago, starting as a chef at San Francisco Sons & Daughters.
Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and deeply saddened" by the death.
"We are a small team working together like a tight family and he will be greatly missed", the spokesperson explained.
We want to let Frank's family know that they are not alone in this difficult time and our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia noted that Frank initially stayed in hostels and that "in the end things were going well for him".
Louis Galicia told KGO, "He had an apartment and was dating a girl".
Louis Galicia said he didn't think there was anyone who might want to hurt his little brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
The way to bond with the family was to always make us a plate, cook us", said Louis Galicia.
He never liked to get into an argument.
My brother was adaptable.
He said, "She was that raw diamond that sparkled every day when everything else in the world was going wrong".

Assistant doctors on strike: New calls for work to slow down
Representatives of the assistant doctors asked their unions to allow them to slow down work over a disagreement over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Assistant Physicians Committee (JDC) general council called for support for further work-slowing action from early September.
JDC said the ministers were unable to address concerns about the contract.
The assistant doctors and medical students voted against the contract agreement with the BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voting members.
In a tweet Thursday night, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had been "insistently silent" about the issues that led to the contract's rejection.
He said: "In light of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract entirely and called for a resumption of formal negotiations on the concerns".
In response to the government's silence, JDC management made a formal request to the BMA Board to allow a program to increase the work slowdown from the beginning of September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by paramedics this year, including the first total shutdown in the history of the NHS.
Dr. Johann Malawana, assistant physician leader at the BMA, resigned after the BMA voted against the terms of the contract.
During the pre-vote meetings of 54,000 physician assistants and medical students, he told the BMA members that this was a good deal that should be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be implemented in a way that would apply to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of the irreconcilable'?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the lavish hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I got the obvious impression that Ankara was the side most in favor of this compromise.
Shake hands, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile was rather faint and could hardly be said to have exuded any warmth even by his own narrow standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly mentioned his "good friend" Mr Putin, five times according to one report.
I'm surprised at the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to pre-crisis levels, but reach much higher levels.
The next day, a local newspaper said that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement was the opposite.
But Mr. Putin's cold reaction showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
The Russian reaction at the time was furious.
Mr. Putin made a harsh statement accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The resentment was much greater, the other side was thought to be friendly.
It will be difficult, if not impossible, to rebuild trust in the real world.
Since November, the opinion of the Russian people has also changed.
The state-controlled media has been targeting Ankara for months in a shocking and aggressive manner.
Suddenly, the Turks are to blame for everything.
The most serious of these were allegations by senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's family profited from illegal oil trade in areas under the control of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He flatly refused.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
In the end, the reason this meeting took place was because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia may see this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of a ceasefire call for Ankara are clear.
First, he needs friends after Erdogan's failed coup last month that almost toppled him.
He was also deeply affected by the repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
And economic reasons are also at work.
The sanctions imposed by Russia have hit hard, especially the ban on private flights carrying several million Russian tourists to Turkey's coastal regions every year.
That number has dropped by almost 90 percent.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies are certainly relieved that flights will resume.
They're counting on the end-of-season intensity in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted that the import of Turkish agricultural products would be allowed to resume, and the prices of fruits and vegetables would fall.
To quote a story in the Vedemosti newspaper, "Tourists there, tomatoes here".
But the visit had a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for not finding the response to the coup attempt adequate.
Adding to his long-standing anger over the snail-like pace of talks to join the US, Mr Putin, who wants to take advantage of Turkey's disconnect from the West and the coldness between them, steps in.
The Russian leader certainly seems to have garnered sympathy from Ankara for his call for support for elected officials after the coup attempt.
It must be remembered that this was an inevitable attitude for Moscow, which itself was deeply afraid of regime change.
This summit, held in this ostentatious palace by the sea, represents what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of the irrational" between Russia and Turkey: a merging of the powers of two countries that the West rejects and mistreats.
Yet despite this appearance of compromise, they are quite different.
One of the most important of these is about Syria: Russia and Turkey are backing different sides, even though Moscow is portraying itself as a mediator.
And it's supported by the fact that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said that the issue was not raised at the press conference.
While the President of Turkey has avoided answering a question about these differences, Mr. Putin has chosen to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to define a common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the absolute potential for disaster that resulted from NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian warplane - it is certainly a good development that the two leaders are at least beginning to talk.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland.
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will move to the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be gone for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is linked to the bank's global goals.
Eight years ago, he was in a state of near collapse, and he had to withdraw and give it up.
During this time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships from the Six Nations rugby championship to the Andy Murray championship at Wimbledon.
But now, it's been decided that it's right to put more national brands on the map.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but no new beginnings will be made.
All references to RBS, except in the case of a central and listed company in England and Wales, will be replaced by NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Smaller brands that would take on a much more dominant role for personal banking are Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan was interviewing on a tour of Inverness-shire for customers and staff.
He told BBC Scotland: "We will no longer be a bank with more brands, so the RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand where our staff are employed".
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we're not global anymore, we're local.
Each of these brands will stand out a little bit differently in the community they're in, and our staff will work with customers under those brand names.
RBS had announced that it would not continue sponsoring the Six Nations Championship and was raising the profile of different brands in terms of sports sponsorship.
The CEO said, "It's time to move on to the brand banking concept because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make it a better bank for customers?"
If three years ago we'd said we'd be a great bank for our customers and offer these brands, I would have found it ridiculous.
But I think you're going to see a lot of change with the work we're doing and focusing on the needs of the customers, not ourselves.
We can get these brands back on track, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory at Newmarket with Predilection.
Dettori has exploded in champagne after his double victory at Newmarket and his 3,000th victory.
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
On the local track, he achieved this milestone with his second victory of the night on the Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the unimpeded sprint.
He's following in the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The jockey, who has won three championships in Ghayyar, said: "This is a special situation".
I was so touched that my family was here.
I'm really happy that this is Newmarket, where I started 30 years ago.
This is not a big meeting, not a Royal Ascot - just a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and relieved.
Dettori accepted the cheers after the victory by bringing in Predilection.
Two jockeys have achieved this milestone in the handicap race: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired jockey Sir Anthony McCoy, a 20-time champion with over 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, has 4,493 career wins.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it's no surprise that he's reached a milestone that only a few before him have.
A man of style and strength, but the element that puts him on the scale is his tactical mindset.
He is an extraordinary representative of horse racing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted people to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago, in Epsom, I told Frankie that he could have won 6,000 if it wasn't for a jockey who only raced on weekends and in big races.
Seriously, Frankie has spent most of his 30 years racing in the UK with victories, which is nice to see.
He has a very exciting character, which is a very good quality for British racing, but he's also an exceptional jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone with a symbolic jump-off.
From his jumps to his landings, Frankie Dettori has been the symbol of British unobstructed running for 20 years.
It was a bumpy road.
In 1996, he won several major races, including his famous 'Big Seven' victory at Ascot, but survived a plane crash and was banned for not complying with a drug ban.
Three years ago, when he returned from this six-month suspension, he initially struggled, but he showed the strength of character needed to prove those who suspected him wrong and return to his best.
And it could go on for a while longer; Dettori had previously expressed his desire to continue racing until he was at least 50.
Russian President Putin has dismissed his personal pen Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his personal pen Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of Mr. Putin's inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as special representative for environmental and transportation issues.
A statement from the Kremlin said Mr Putin had "decided to terminate Ivanov's position as head of the Russian administration", but gave no reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been deputy to Mr. Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to this position.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
He later dealt with presidential protocol and administration of government personnel; statements on the Kremlin website are as follows (Russian).
After his appointment, he told Mr. Putin: "Thank you for your trust in me".
I believe the most important function of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of making laws and overseeing the implementation of instructions.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that he had asked Mr. Ivanov to step down and recommended Mr. Vaino to replace him.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a move that surprises Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov had long served as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like himself, had served in the Soviet security forces, the KGB.
The pen, in particular, was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, both said the private pen was withdrawn at their own request.
But despite the smiling poses on camera, few here are convinced, especially as the parliamentary elections approach.
Is this some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official announcement that a potential president would suddenly want to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with great suspicion.
According to a Kremlin website, Mr. Ivanov said to Mr. Putin: "In a conversation we had in early 2012, I asked you to trust me for four years on this difficult - even problematic - task.
Well, apparently, I was the president's private secretary for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
Previously, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin was head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr. Ivanov delegated to him.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he listed Ivanov as one of his five most trusted people.
Since Mr. Putin's third term as president was unconstitutional, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov could become president after Mr. Putin's second term.
But that task was given to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin was prime minister before he was re-elected president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired after he shot a producer.
Gibson got into a physical fight on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, announced in a joint statement that she was fired.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Tuesday before his termination was announced.
There were differences and a disagreement on the set about creative matters.
"I am saddened by the events", he said in a statement.
A statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios stated that details on how Gibson's character would be removed from the show, which follows a group of FBI agents, would be provided at a later date.
The 54-year-old actor, who was previously on the situation comedy Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.
Gibson said in a statement released on Friday, "I love Criminal Minds and have worked on it with my heart and soul for the past twelve years".
I'd like to stay until the end, but that's no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our amazing team, and most importantly, the best supporters a show can have.
The show is expected to return to the screens on September 28 for its twelfth season.
The mystery of the fish in Banff Garden
A resident of the Banff area has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks these 75 fish could be sand fish being transported by sea hose.
Bain, who lives 500 meters above sea level, posted the footage on Periscope in the hope that someone would shed light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Pass: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern end of Queensferry Pass and the viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "board fans" that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge's span from Fife is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown was one of the first to walk from the land bridge to the facility today.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge.
We are all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale with this project, which used over 30,000 tons of concrete to build just this section of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge, which bridges the gap between the viaduct and the bridge board, this is a delicate work that requires extremely fine tolerances for fit.
Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge signage is in place, and the concrete casting of the first section of the signage will take place today in Rosyth, which means the entire signage will be ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director at Forth Pass and Bridge Contractors, said: "In all bridge projects, the first closure is always a significant milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents a pioneering step in civil engineering.
Once the final road sign was installed and connected to the level of the expanding North Tower, we had to close the gap on the north or land side.
This was accomplished by pulling the northern viaduct down to 700 millimeters south.
It was a huge, but also a very delicate process.
The reason it was so large was that the viaduct was 700 feet long, weighed almost 6,000 tons, and had to be retracted at a slope of about 3 percent.
The reason it was sensitive was that the tolerances the team had to comply with were very low, only a few millimeters on either side.
Thankfully, everything went well.
Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after falling from a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after the unit saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
The three men were trying to swim to safety as their boats continued on their own.
"We saw the boat circling towards them and became concerned", said Moelfre, who was in charge of the lifeboat control.
"Unfortunately", he added, "it was driven away by a violent wind until we found a way".
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, a 60-year-old man, was found fatigued, clinging to a life jacketless chandelier.
They were all put on a lifeboat that made its way to shore and brought to the lifeboat station .
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who fell into the water are lucky to be alive and unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency stop cable, but it must have been cut off from the boat's operator somehow when the boat was in the water.
These three men were being watched today.
A valuable form of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It's really amazing to see how the world has changed.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been a cause for concern for many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to get up and move from the couch.
Time spent looking at screens, originally limited to television, has spread over time to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it's really great to see that technology and outdoor activities aren't mutually exclusive.
And of course, I'm talking about Pokémon Go, a character-based app that was originally created for a video game in the '90s (and later turned into a comic book, playing cards, and other byproducts).
Like many other pop culture phenomena, this new game was a sensation when it was released in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, the launch was postponed in other countries due to intense interest that caused overload on servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
To put it simply, players can pick up their smartphones, search for Pokémon, and GPS-tracked 'take a picture' (taking a screenshot on their phone) or 'capture' what they find.
He jumped off the couch and joined the madness in search of a generation who played the game at a younger age.
In the United States, gambling has led to a dramatic increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that the percentage of people it tracked who exercised every day for 30 days increased from 45 percent to 53 percent in the two days after the game launched.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go; they can only see raw data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns that encourage people to "take 30 minutes", "get off the couch", and "get active every day" have been ignored because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who seem miserable.
But still, the importance of exercise is understated.
People who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with things like weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and the list of benefits is too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
This provides for all three basic elements of health: exercise, fresh air, and sunlight and recreation.
Some people even make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, there are some disfigured disruptors looking for something to complain about.
And of course, someone could walk in and knock on the door.
What difference does it make?
A major innovation has been introduced.
While smartphone apps like Fitbit tracked our movements, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game.
The effect of innovation will wear off and use will decline over time.
But because of Pokémon's success, there will be many games that will help people who hunt become more active, fit and healthy through the combination of apps and virtual reality with real-world activities.

Simone Biles won the gold medal in the women's gymnastics all-around.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic in the jump.
It's comfortable on the balance.
It's amazing with the floor.
Excellence at first.
And he's an Olympic champion now.
The 19-year-old American gymnast finished first overall on Thursday, clearly showing the difference between herself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
Her total of 62.198 points was far above the silver medalist and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles from the United States performed on the balance beam in the women's artistic gymnastics all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win the overall rating award in a row and the fifth overall, and made a name for herself as the best of her generation and perhaps of all time.
When the final summary was published, she broke down in tears and her long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement put him on a par with athletes like Michael Phelps, who would be seen once in every generation, taking the sport to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years with 15 world championship medals, 10 of them gold, and a blend of ambition and sensitivity that has led 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton to call herself "the best gymnast I've ever seen", with striking routines that have made her one of the sport's most successful.
A final test in Brazil awaited him, a contest between Biles and the other guys on the field, rather than between him and the burden of high expectations.
It would be a disappointment to see him return to his family home in Spring, Texas with less than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman of the United States, after winning gold and silver medals, respectively, in the women's artistic gymnastics all-around at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first on Tuesday, when retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as a farewell gesture at the party.
While Biles insists on never looking ahead in this long run to the top, that's not exactly true.
The part, which includes the iconic pedal passage of the floor exercise routine, is set to Latin music that will perfectly fit the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Adopted as a young child by her grandmother and grandfather, and discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gym where Aimee Boorman coached, she became a force to be reckoned with.
He hasn't lost a single overall rating since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should continue as long as Biles wants it to.
Mustafina took the lead in two rounds, but it was temporary.
The balance and ground exercises that Biles took on as world champion hadn't been done yet.
He led the balance beam with 15,433 points and crowned it with 15,933 points on the floor exercise.
Raisman graciously hugged her lightly as she waited for the final score, and tears appeared around the glowing red, white and blue eye makeup as Biles' vision that he once wrote in a scratchpad became reality.
Raisman's performance was a rematch of her performance four years earlier, when she shared fourth but then lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who the Americans call "Grandma", was ahead.
He overcame an occasional suspicious comeback and sent kisses to the crowd after the space exercise.
For 19-year-old Biles, a tweet that was widely shared earlier this week has taken on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case, shot while listening to music in car
In Phoenix's first serial murder in a decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while talking in a car and listening to music, according to police reports released Thursday.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a garage road on June 12.
The report says the gunman fired eight rounds of a pistol while standing on the passenger side of the car and then drove away in another vehicle.
Police say the three murders don't appear to be robberies because the assailant didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900 in cash.
Phoenix police spokesman Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard said investigators are investigating whether the shooting is connected to four previous attacks.
In a four-month period, a total of seven people were killed and two were injured in nine attacks in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods.
Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month, "It happened in a residential area in front of a house".
The suspect is believed to have been driving a brown Nissan, a black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to release evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital with injuries and later died.
Maleah, the daughter of Liner, 31, and Ellis, died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for these people to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an empty van half an hour before the three murders.
Forensics found the casings, removed a bullet from a seat, and found bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old microcephaly patient: "He is getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves to sing, loves toys and, of course, loves his mother.
But unlike his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, a genetic disorder of which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto was unaware during her pregnancy.
When I first came home, my first thought was I couldn't do this.
I can't do this. I can't.
I didn't ask for this.
Of course that's not true, and of course you want it to be".
He and his wife, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to offer to put her in a nursing home.
"My first reaction was to say I don't think people do that anymore", Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with a walker.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl until he was three, and he still cannot speak.
But he's slowly reaching some milestones.
He can walk and ride a bike with help.
He also likes to play games and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund invented to say "please sing to me".
Picciuto told CBS News, "We are teaching him sign language".
But this is not sign language as we know it, it says Edmund made up his own signals.
Microsephaly can occur due to a number of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may be present and it may be caused by infections during pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles and Zika.
The symptoms and the course of the disease can vary greatly.
It's too early to tell how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of the uncertainty of his future.
I kept asking myself what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know it.
In fact, I haven't asked a question about the course of the disease in a long time because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto can offer some hopeful advice for mothers of babies born with Zika.
She's getting better.
You know it's better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain and flooding in Louisiana, Mississippi, have prompted rescue teams
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana, with more rain expected through Saturday, prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
The National Weather Service reports flooding in numerous rivers in northeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, posing a widespread flood threat following heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and support is on the way to affected neighborhoods.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were made for high-water vehicles, boats and trenches.
Steele said tons of trenches were being requested just for Tangipahoa.
A flood watch will be in effect through Saturday for most of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that there could be an additional three to five inches of rain in the area.
In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Saturday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
Both of which are expected to reach record levels over the weekend on the Comite River near Baton Rouge, Louisiana and the Amite River near Denham Springs, Louisiana.
Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood flow in the Ascension neighborhood is a threat because the flow of the flooded rivers to Lake Maurepas will be slow.
The Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state line, was already at its highest level measured at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams continue to rescue people from flooding in the Amite and Wilkinson disasters in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloucester on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
He said another stepson who lived nearby warned him.
Hansford said, "We woke up and the water kept coming".
It was coming up my waist.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he'd seen in the creek in the 48 years he'd lived here.
Hansford stated that he and his family members were disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said he rescued all three emergency workers in a large, military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloucester where they were taking refuge on Friday.
Krautmann said flooding was "spreading rapidly" as heavy rains continued and authorities were considering issuing evacuation orders.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the floor has been in a high saturation state since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and flooded streets have caused the need to rescue residents of Tangipahoa Neighborhood and to vacate schools in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a female council member in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated and taken to two churches, but they're now under water.
Robby Miller, the neighborhood manager, said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by rising waters.
Shelters have been opened for evacuees in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond.
He said, "When the water starts to recede, they will be allowed to return home".
In Hammond, Tangipahoa Parish, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to rising water and ditches were provided for residents to take to keep water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we experienced was in March", said city manager Lacy Landrum.
It looks like this is going to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Disaster Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the rain continues steadily on the Gulf Coast.
He said that on Tuesday, several houses were flooded, but that there was no notification for Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I saw water where I'd never seen it before", Townson said, adding, "and it's still raining".
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was "bullets-pierced", survived the Philadelphia attack.
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
For CBS Philadelphia, Mahaj Brown was identified by his grandparents.
Her grandparents stated that Brown had multiple gunshot wounds to his body, including the pelvis, legs, arms and abdomen, but that he was conscious when brought to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station, "He was in a lot of pain, his little body was punctured by bullets".
I can't believe this.
The boy was listed in critical condition at the hospital and underwent some surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was about to start first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two men, 29, one 32, both shot.
CBS Philadelphia reports one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are stable.
The station reported that the boy was found shot in the front seat of a car with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the wounded was an assailant.
Detectives told CBS Philadelphia that multiple gunmen may have fired into each other.
The scene was filled with casings of assault-style ammunition from different assault weapons.
It certainly seems like a long-term conflict.
There were hives on the street and on both sides of the sidewalk.
"This indicates that there are multiple gunmen and both are active", Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing security cameras.
Another 6-year-old girl was accidentally shot in the arm while playing outside her home in the West Oak neighborhood on Tuesday.
He's in the process of recovery and police are still looking for a suspect.
The reason we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
I named this year's Olympic women's gymnastics team, and there's more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been this dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts who have inspired many girls from different ethnic backgrounds: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
Put together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, the structure of this team is something to be proud of.
The team finally looks like America.
It also reinforces the presence of black and Latino women at the highest levels of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has always been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's a powerful thing.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America backed her up.
Now the entire world will witness the extraordinary performances of three World Champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who perform their unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win the gold medal in the women's all-around.
And his teammate Aly Raisman won silver.
We're witnessing the best of times for this sport, but that doesn't seem to be the case at gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
The reason they are "Final Five" is that the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi will coach.
However, in reality gymnastics is a very expensive sport and gymnasts work primarily in private gymnastics clubs supported by fees paid by parents for training, travel, uniforms, competition, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and families) and many more.
Most of these gyms are in affluent suburbs that can afford these businesses.
These clubs are the only place gymnasts can train and require a costly and long-term commitment from gymnasts' families.
Simone Biles' coach, Aimee Boorman, and Laurie Hernandez's coach, Maggie Haney, have been coaching these athletes since the day they started gymnastics.
We're not offering communities more affordable and accessible gymnastics training for the countless young girls who were affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, based in Harlem, we've provided free and low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 young people in the city, mostly black and Hispanic, and we've coached both national and international champions.
In September, we'll expand to Detroit, where I grew up, to provide quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and enjoy this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics improves the body's strength, flexibility and coordination and provides mental hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination offers long-term benefits in terms of health, school performance, and job performance.
It's going to be the inspiration that this team will provide that will lead thousands of young girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Participating in sports activities is very important, especially for girls.
We're going through a really exciting time.
Thank you to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for bringing home the Olympic gold medal as a team to showcase "Girl Power" and motivate so many young girls from diverse backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the assistant doctors decided to continue the strikes.
Ministers had hoped the dispute would end after an agreement was reached with the British Medical Association staff on an improved contract, but 58 percent of the 37,000 physician assistants who took part in the vote voted against.
In July, Mr Hunt announced plans to impose a sanction on the contract, stating that the NHS was "no one's property" and that further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first group of physician assistants were moved to a new contract that included changes to their work practices at night and on weekends to improve care outside normal hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's physician assistants committee, said in a statement last night: "Physician assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it would trigger the current workforce crisis and not provide equal treatment for all physicians".
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are re-hired, this process needs to be advanced and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute through dialogue have been met with a reluctance from the government to intervene and, in some cases, deafening silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that the door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act immediately, lift the sanction and listen to the concerns of the attending physicians".
The assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to increase their actions to slow down if he doesn't.
In the latest strike, in late April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, forcing nurses and counselors to take the place of doctors on strike.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after an agreement was reached with the British Medical Association officials on the revised contract.
The BMA wants a weekend pay raise for the 54,000 physician assistants who are under contract.
The executive director of the NHS Employers' Council, Daniel Mortimer, has called on the medical staff to call a general strike.
Mr Mortimer said: "The strike will not solve anything but cause anxiety, discomfort and distress to patients, carers and their families by putting pressure on the already busy staff and services".
Over the past two months, we've continued to engage with the Assistant Physicians Committee and have approached their concerns about the Oversight and Reporting Task Force with the Department of Health and other officials in a positive manner.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive communication on key issues - such as distribution, training flexibility, further training for career breakers, training costs, mutual agreement on curriculum, education-related leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - and the continued action in line with the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May, was a sign that employers were being taken seriously by the UK Department of Medical Education and Health.
A drug that could eliminate the risk of heart attack for £ 2 a day
With the authorities recommending more people to be given it over a longer period of time, thousands of heart attack patients could benefit from the £2 a day drug.
Ticagrelor, which prevents clotting, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug was given for 12 months following a heart attack and reduced the risk of stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog, NICE, recommended giving it to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has recommended giving it to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Each year, about 140,000 people in Britain have a heart attack, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances that build up in the artery walls to form plaque.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
And if the clot is dislodged, it travels through the bloodstream and blocks blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had one attack before are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, made by the UK company AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of a clot.
The draft NICE guideline published today recommends that individuals receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatments, up to a quarter of heart attack patients have another heart attack or stroke, and the results are often devastating".
Fear of relapse can have a very negative effect on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that the use of ticagrelar with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attack and stroke in people who have previously had a heart attack.
We're pleased that by offering the commercial provision, we've increased the treatment options available to the thousands of people waiting to benefit.
Because of limited information on the efficacy and safety of commercial use beyond three years - including the risk of bleeding initially - the draft guideline does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
PC culture has increased voter corruption in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was sacked last year following a government report on corruption.
As the devastating government report released today shows, a culture of political correctness has led to the ignorance of widespread voter corruption in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles has rebuked the police, election observers and the town hall for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "extreme sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former community secretary and current anti-corruption czar said that the religious grounds of voter suppression are so bad that police should be allowed to pull the ribbon outside polling booths to protect the fearful voters.
He suggested that voters carry their IDs with them to prove their identity when they vote.
In the current situation, the selector simply needs to give his name and address.
The report even recommends that people wear permanent ink on their fingers during voting to prevent them from voting twice.
Sir Eric said that those who were informed should be better protected.
He called for better access to the press for board documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes along with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following the vote scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled to remove Lutfur Rahman from office after repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found Rahman "shamelessly abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and silenced critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman "conducted his campaign on the basis that it is a religious duty for believing Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 games were suspicious or the result of using a fake ID, i.e. voting as someone else.
Sir Eric has stated that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He warned of corruption, especially in postal voting - where it was alleged that elderly members of the Muslim community were pressured to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric has made some suggestions for a voting system that would include people carrying identification to prove who they are.
The report included the following statements: "Evidence has been obtained that some ethnic minority communities have pressured their valued members, primarily women and youth, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, particularly in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that government agencies were ignoring such behavior because of 'political correctness' based on oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to reform the system, including preventing political activists from processing ballots by mail for the purpose of "picking up votes".
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tighter registration controls to prevent voter registration from being used for immigration and welfare corruption.
Consideration of the option of making it mandatory for voters to show their identity before voting.
Permanent ink applied to a person's fingers after voting to prevent any person from voting twice.
Systematic checks on the person's affiliation to determine eligibility to vote.
A three-year limit on requests to vote by mail.
Prohibiting political campaign workers and activists from processing completed postal ballots and postal ballot envelopes.
Authorizing police to strip the polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Making it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.
Only English is required in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthening staff training on enforcing the rule that voters enter the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric has been a harsh critic of the Police Service, saying it is "interesting" that no charges have been brought in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court ruled that there is no place for accusations of corruption and illegal activities against Lutfur Rahman and his representative", he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds beyond reasonable doubt, based on the nature of the criminal evidence.
He also criticized the ineffective "box marking controls" in the municipal election registration departments.
"Last year's decision in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call", said Sir Eric.
While our nation may take pride in being the mother of parliaments, this alarming and secret election corruption and its rejection by some institutions may damage that good reputation.
Being crazy about Kate's cycling looks and other famous looks from the Rio Olympics
This week, Rio 2016 Olympic enthusiasts went wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian isn't the only athlete to draw attention to his celebrity likeness as he battles for the gold medal this summer, at least that's what social media thinks.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities we see on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who look more like Hollywood celebrities than they look.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left), a member of the U.S. Men 's Archery Team , compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's resemblance on the bike path, many online people have suggested that an archer can look as much like Leonardo DiCaprio as a twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, took to Twitter after photos surfaced showing his resemblance to the star of the movie The Money Hunter.
And the archer, noticing this craze on social media, admitted that he'd been told since he was a kid that he looked like Leo.
Brady told the Huffington Post: "I don't think there's a huge resemblance except for the hair and beard".
'He's a handsome man himself, so I guess that's a compliment.'
There's another similarity that's one of the most popular comparisons of London 2012, and one that will undoubtedly get even more attention this year: the incredible resemblance of British long jumper Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina is said to be a perfect match for Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan, with her large and meaningful eyes.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user is saying that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Star Wars movie star
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared for the similarity of their thick eyebrows and lips.
The Russian team silver medalist has the same bronze skin and blond hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while fans say that Nathan Adrian of Team USA "reminds me of the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial shape and eyes
Not alone: One Twitter user was thrilled that others noticed this similarity.
One theory that's still up in the air: This user thinks there might be a reason why this couple looks similar.
One Twitter user took to the site to express his happiness that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are like twins".
In reality, the American football star and Dexter actress has similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include the almost identical smile of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and the similar large smiles of Gabby Douglas, another gold medalist gymnast, and Gabrielle Union, star of the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for comment that Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the 4x200m freestyle event angered viewers of the CBC's live broadcast of the Olympics on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize for a comment by one of its speakers that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "was wiped out like a bad smell" and "died like a pig" in the race.
Speaker Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to express his opinion in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on to add color to the CBC's panel, was heard to say, "14-year-old little Chinese boy screwed up big time, baby".
He was too excited, he went off like a bad smell and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished the second leg of the flag race with a time of 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds behind Canada's Taylor Rack, allowing the Canadians to close the gap between them and China.
The Canadian audience moved quickly after being stunned by the tone and language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC anchor just say the 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'?"
The idiot didn't know it was still on the air.'
Chinese Ai Yanhan, 4 x 200m Freestyle flag race, was described as, '14-year-old little Chinese guy did a heavy bag, baby.'
There was a very strong and quick Twitter review of Byron MacDonald, and many of them were about to report him.
Twitter users couldn't help but be moved by Byron Macdonald's insensitive behavior.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and you make us all look like racists. #midebulan.
Shortly thereafter, CBC's Scott Russell apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We apologize for the commentary on the swimming competition".
Those were truly unfortunate words, and we regret that this happened.'
CBC has had to apologize at least 90 times more than people who tweeted in response to the comment.
Another speaker, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC later copied and pasted the apology to over 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments.
The network quickly issued a statement apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements were made and that they were published.
Last night, on the air, we apologized quickly to our viewers, our social media followers.
We'd like to clarify that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but about his performance.
However, these were rather inappropriate and unfortunate words, and Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to defend his words by saying he didn't want to be a personal attack.
She said on CBC's Olympic broadcast, "I want to apologize for a comment I made after the women's flag race last night".
'I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not his personality.'
'No need to say more, I meant no disrespect and I'm very sorry.'
Primark customer, in the middle of the store, threw up on a woman who was trying on underwear.
Customers didn't know what to do when a woman took off her panties to try on panties in the middle of Primark on the store floor.
What's worse, she looked at what it looked like on her, took it out and put it back on the shelf.
She kept looking and then tried on four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The place where she tried on the panties before they were put back on the shelf was Primark, in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on the mystery woman's underwear, she "got dressed again and left the store without taking anything".
He said: "The people could not believe their eyes".
He stood in the middle of the store and he took a pair of panties from the window, took off his panties and his socks and put them on.
'He didn't try to find a special place to do it, 'he stood in the middle with all his disrespect.'
'Everyone was looking at her when she took the panties off, 'and it was obvious she didn't like the panties 'because she put them back on the shelf.'
She tried three more clothes before deciding she didn't like any of them, and then she dressed up and left the store.
'She seemed to care little about the people watching her and not to think about who would buy the panties she was trying on next.'
"It's disgusting to think that someone would take someone else's unwashed underwear and go home", said Mrs. Davidson, 33, of Kent.
This incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: 'I think the staff found the clothes after he left and put them up for sale, which is a good thing.'
'It would be really bad to think that when I go home with a new pair of panties, someone else puts them on and takes them off and comes to me without washing.'
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of the incident at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.'
The product in question has been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The outside world is very dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can help you feel safer.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, head of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to learn how to deal with close-range armed robbers.
Whether it's coming at you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says that when you're approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around and see the attacker and "clear the line of fire".
Then you hold the gun between your forearm and shoulder and hit him in the face with your empty elbow.
Then, when you kneel on his crotch, the aggressor's pain will double, and at this point, you turn the gun around and take it from his hand and you hit him in the face with the gun facing him, with the barrel and the back of the gun up.
When the gunman approaches from the front, a similar technique is used: you pull your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun, and turn it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, you give your weight to the weapon, punch the attacker in the chest area, turn the weapon around, take it from him, and then you pull back, pointing the weapon at him.
Does that sound like a joke?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, unless you're a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid every robbery is to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright stuck his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide.
The English traveller has put his immune system and biting reflex to the test by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Ian Wright, 51, a presenter and travel writer from Suffolk, stuck his tongue on a euro banknote, a Piccadily Circus barrier, a train toilet flush button and a Russian pay phone to prove the strength of the immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what kind of work he was involved in.
But the experiment, which was made into a movie called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, yielded some surprising results.
While the thought of licking a faucet button on a trendy toilet that thousands of people use is extremely disgusting, there are actually far more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts about the growth of stomach bacteria and his health.
Luckily, nothing she licked had any effect except the bad taste she left in her mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for traveling the world and testing his stomach for strength by eating strange and wonderful things.
From the general railroad railroad bulkheads to the toilet-tube buttons, this mission definitely tested the immune system.
In the film, he said: 'I have not been very careful about my health since I was a child and have put everything in my mouth, from dirt and worms to muddy water.'
And over the course of the film, he proved the reason for that reputation.
The only thing she turned down was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The trail sample showed luminometer counts over 4,000 units.
To make a comparison, freshly washed hands should be under 60.
But when the luminometer count went over 4,000 units, he was under 60 with freshly washed hands, and it was a Russian public toilet he refused to lick.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio have taken on the production of a travel film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
He said in the film, "This is about the worst thing I've ever smelled in a bathroom".
It can't get any dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was developed in conjunction with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as stomach bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Valio's Snacks, Juices and New Categories Division, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that's fascinating to watch and also explains the benefits of probiotics.
We had a lot of crazy brainstorming where we finally got the idea to go look for Ian.
They claim that concern for stomach health has become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put products in a much larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The concern about gut health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we could provide consumers with more information about this in an engaging way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The film's director, Tom Hakala, added: "I'll tell you, I would lose respect for Ian if he licked something I wanted him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film".
Naturally, some things were easy for Ian to lick, but some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty licking acts.'
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84 percent of participants linked lactic acid bacteria to stomach health, and 58 percent reported using products containing lactic acid bacteria at least intermittently.
The Maganda family destroyed their Saltash, Cornwall social housing just before the evacuation.
A Maghreb family has caused £50,000 worth of damage to a social housing they were evacuated from after they frightened their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the housing association authorities were shocked to see that the property was in a state of disrepair.
The walls were full of holes, the floorboards were torn down, the floor was littered with trash, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family has now been removed from the residence and are believed to be using private accommodation options.
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the situation was beyond repair.
He said: 'This is really a nightmare for people here and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There's a lot to consider because this estate will be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and their names have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who lived in the intermittent property, and according to the police, the family adopted a range of scary behaviors, including fighting with baseball bats in the street, intimidating neighbors, using drugs, selling drugs and excessively shouting, arguing and swearing.
In June, an antisocial behavior order was issued for Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease.
In many rooms of the house that was supposed to be demolished , there was old trash .
The floorboards were removed from the property where the drug trade used to take place
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and police were often called.
Cornwall Housing forced him and his wife off the property this week after giving them an 11-week extension to move in voluntarily.
The evacuation was welcomed by relieved neighbors who said their lives were turning into nightmares.
One person said: 'Nobody cared.'
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen cops in here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because it was so quiet, we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, and everything's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighborhood sanction officer with Cornwall Housing, said the family was not cooperating with local authorities.
The family had lived in this house for 20 years, and the property was often called police.
The planted side of the social housing was littered with garbage and old toys
He added: 'It is truly shameful that the tenant has not taken any responsibility for the eviction of himself and his family, which has always been Cornwall Housing's last resort.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and the actions were so frightening that the neighbors should not have witnessed.
I greatly appreciate the efforts of my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police Force and the community members who have courageously stepped forward to inform us.
I hope this development provides some relief to the neighbors and is taken as a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons who lived on the property at different times, but they were in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the evacuation
Housing workers will have to clean up the garbage piles around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of marijuana, scales, personal effects and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to sell.
He claimed to use the money to buy a headstone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Tanya and her husband are now living in a private home in Plymouth.
There were graffiti on the walls of most of the rooms of the house.
Police said they'll work to evict tenants who violate the rental rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a warning to other tenants who continued to break the rules.
He said, 'This is also a message to those who think they can do whatever they want without being accused and that their behavior will be in vain.'
The Devon and Cornwall Police will continue to work with their partners to protect the community and will never tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane flew over the beach
Tourists sunbathing in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force has flown the P-3C Orion at extremely low altitudes
The Air Force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is when the tourists start to panic as they fly over the beach full of low-flying jets.
In dramatic footage, military aircraft approach near-contact with sunbathers in the sands of Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up, understandably worried about the noise from the jet engines, not seeing what was coming at them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who shared videos of the dramatic close-flight on social media, said: "It really went down twice and at one point it looked like it was about to crash".
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to crash on me.'
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a plane emerged from the darkness and began flying at extremely low altitudes
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of a P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the coast and had to go so low that the only way to control them was to fly them.
The nearby firefighting power said the jet was flying lower than normal due to poor visibility due to smoke from the fire, but the air force insisted that no one's safety was in danger.
This summer, powered fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that made it difficult to see (intense fog and smoke caused by the powered-out fires)
The plane was on a training flight and as part of the drill , the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats
London student who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London to join ISIS last year, died in Syria.
His lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said his family learned of his death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that he was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on the Raqqa region where the group is strong in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died while planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"We hope this situation will be a gravestone and testament to others that it is really risky to go to war zones and discourage people from making this choice".
In February 2015, two schoolgirls from Sultana and east London boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then a bus bound for the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid has indicated that he will not drop Garland as a Supreme Court nominee if Clinton is elected.
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if elected.
Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland's confirmation process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the president will choose the replacement for former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a video speech Thursday that he believed Clinton would choose Garland and that "they have reasons for that".
Later, a spokesman for Reid said that he had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether to nominate Garland and was speculating.
He praised Garland, saying that Clinton's team did not want to "disturb the status quo" by holding a new election.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were "supporters" and "sidekicks" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He stated that Trump was unfit for the position.
Treats said it was in favor of a nude calendar "as much for women as for men".
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar for 2017 inspired by the 1970s Pirelli.
But instead of celebrities and nudists, they're working to find a new generation of ball models for the 2017 NU Inspirational Fairies calendar.
Treats president Steve Shaw stated earlier this year that the magazine, which has a high nudity rate, is different from the older Playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for the women.
Apparently, he believes the calendar is the same.
Shaw said in a press release about the calendar, "We need to get back to the old-fashioned, classic nudity display so that women, like men, can feel comfortable looking at these images of the female body as an inspiration".
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can upload photos online or participate in open calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: who are the real buyers of the records?
Middle-aged, single men love the vinyl.
Before we go into the comments section to make some great insults under the banner of All Single Middle-Aged Men Are Not Like That, let us say that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about recycling of records is not the result of a millennial's quest for innovation created by a physical object, but of a middle-aged nostalgia.
Most recent vinyl buyers are between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the least likely.
It's also not just the hoarding behavior of the curious; it's also emotionally significant; older vinyl buyers tend to like to keep their emotions to themselves (56% and 53% respectively) and enjoy being alone (69% and 66% respectively).
And are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog was a TV news story, the camera would see me walking down a busy Soho street in a modest gray suit, making many gestures before stopping, and then putting my hands together and saying something authoritative like, "Well, let's have a look".
Well, let's have a look.
While the centre of Soho is slowly losing its charm and unusual atmosphere (buildings once occupied by independent sellers are now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases), there are still a few specialist record shops.
I would probably ask her to stand in front of the camera for the next part, and I would stand close to different men in some of these stores and try to observe them to learn about their ages and their emotional states.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, who I followed on the way from Sister Ray to Reckless Records, is spending an afternoon in London for a meeting and looking through the stores to fill a few free hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
He says, "I guess I am".
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plaques above (she emailed me the picture, I didn't follow her home) decorate the walls of the living room.
The reason he has so many albums and singles is partly because of his disposable income, which he now has to buy records that he can't afford when they first come out and buy back what he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the stuff I buy is late '60s, early '70s, when I was 11 or 12 years old, too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be reclusive, solitary people, adding: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink too much alcohol.
That's my bad mood.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, thinks most of the customers she meets fit her YouGov profile.
But he also saw a new wave of hype in the media, which made people feel the need to buy old records again.
In my interviews, I've learned that he usually took people's collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who used to sell their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy back records".
This may explain the increase in people of a certain age who are reviving vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes you a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a relaxing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers were especially upset about the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to take refuge in the stability of familiar record covers, which are overwhelmed by the digital world and recall the calm memories of youth.
"Sometimes it's to fill a void or to see material things as a kind of comfort", says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, so I have it, and I think most people have it.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
A coworker jumps off a pile of records and says, "We're like social workers".
A poll in April revealed that 50% of people who bought vinyl records last month had not yet listened to the album.
The survey also found that 41 percent owned a pickup truck they never used, and 7 percent bought vinyl despite not having a record player.
At this point in the story, I would probably look extremely anxious as I reviewed a series of bossa nova compositions.
The "reward" aspect of this comeback is also an element noticed by Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came to me and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelf.'"
That's not a large percentage, but it certainly reflects the current situation.
More produce, less music.
Some people say, "I don't have a record player".
These are not old people, these are young people, in their late teens, newcomers to the subject.
When I get to Fopp, who now has almost an entire floor dedicated to vinyl, I see that the audience is quite variable.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, young boys and middle-aged women.
The atmosphere is less quiet than the aforementioned stores (the last part of Wild Beast) and it's good to see the diversity among customers, although sex pop is spreading from the speakers instead of soothing jazz.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to sort out the psychological trauma that's bothering them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the discount records.
He's just out looking at the windows instead of spending.
He says he doesn't have the option of making a record collection because he doesn't make much.
It's too expensive.
It's easier to listen to music on a computer or in other forms, but the beauty of vinyl"... he sighs away like a lover.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop was a store that's said to inspire the next generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
While pretending to go through jeans, I observe a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter argue about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairwell full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac -- records that would be unusual for an average collector -- a mixture of modern and classic.
No one is looking; maybe it's just for decorative purposes, some are too high to touch.
It's a completely "artistic vinyl".
But the curiosity about these items could mean the industry makes more money and sends fewer customers deep into Soho, so there's not much to complain about.
It's not surprising that a demographic with more money and time than most spends more on more luxury items like vinyl.
But my findings suggest that YouGov's findings are true, at least for Soho record stores, which are over-represented, not counting female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts in record stores or online forums.
These people probably work pretty hard at school or in offices.
These people certainly don't spend Thursday evenings wandering around record shops on Berwick Street, looking at records and avoiding the gaze of a 30-year-old fake TV host staring over the shoulders of middle-aged men who know nothing.
Greenland shark, the world's longest-living living vertebrate - video news
Scientists have revealed that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the record belongs to a five-meter-long female, thought to be between 272 and 512 years old
A French court has rejected a proposal to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
A court in France has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of flimsy shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should demolish a total of 72 tent shops where people in the camp sell a variety of products, from cigarettes to energy drinks, haircuts or basic food items for 50 cents (40p) of tea or a few euros.
The Calais governorate argued that these sites should be demolished because they create a parallel economy without paying taxes and pose risks in terms of fire and hygiene.
Aid groups explained to the court that shops and restaurants were vital and that the free food provided by state-sponsored organizations and other groups was not enough for the camp's growing population.
They argued that convenience stores and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille said there was no legal basis for deporting the 72 shopkeepers, but the governor's concerns were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants play a much larger role than simply feeding people living in "extremely dangerous conditions".
He said these areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites in danger of collapse, the nonprofit Jungle Book Cafe for Children, serves 200 meals a day, teaches English and French, and provides asylum counseling to hundreds of underage refugees in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to save this cafe for children.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure would be "a disaster for these children, some as young as eight".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population of the Jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 (the highest figure to date) after the number of arrivals increased during the summer.
After gold in the Fiji Masters, Britain settled for silver in the rugby sevens championship.
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby Sevens Championship came to an end after a 43-7 defeat to Fiji in the final on Thursday at the Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a master class in grip, pass, side step, support, running lines and muscle strength to win the first Olympic medal of any color.
After the defeat, Britain took the third silver medal of the day as a not-so-bad consolation prize and can now be proud of their efforts in the opening tournament of the Olympics 7 where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
He may have caught them in the final after beating South Africa 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier in the day.
But still, a Fiji in such good shape could beat a 15-man squad.
It may be hard to believe, but perhaps Britain can take comfort in the thought that at least one Briton will wear the gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
It's been a very difficult journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, when you worked with Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Seven Championship.
This time, they only lost one.
While this defeat is painful, the progress made is truly astounding.
Fiji made a spellbinding start, with the players jumping over the attempts of Great Britain to get the ball.
It was like running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and the World Series champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisao moved in from the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another false-number from the right wing.
The score was 12-0 and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant interception, like a mountain, prevented Leone Nakarawa from throwing a third, but it only delayed Fiji's number.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Great Britain fell behind 17-0
With just one minute left in the first half, Nakarawa scored another goal from the start.
Later, Vatemo Ravouvou crossed the line for the score, going through some tough UK interventions.
With that score, the score is 29-0 in the half.
When the team was set up to play in the Fijian 7s championship, it seemed that the UK was still learning the basics.
That's pretty much it.
Great Britain made big changes in the middle of the circuit and closed the Fiji dam for four minutes, which was a good improvement from the first half, until Josua Tuisova came on stage with a perfect Fiji play.
Dan Norton had a try for Great Britain and tried to score from the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game was in the hands of the South Sea Islanders, who sang, waved the flag and danced.
It was really hard not to admire the cheerful approach of Fiji from start to finish.
Maa William also loved the final additions to the Fiji game that didn't need to be embellished at the last minute.
When the whistle blew, the Fijians began to celebrate and the British were routed to the dressing room.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, while Great Britain faced South Africa in a tough semi-final; Britain led by a single point.
Kyle Brown took the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton led the second half with his dizzying footwork and scores.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who is in the top 15 in England, has been a great interception and the victory and the silver medal are guaranteed.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their coaches' battle with cancer, raced to victory in the shot put.
There will be no more emotional gold medal at these games, and that is significant.
After 220 excruciating breaths from first to last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won gold at the Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
Although there were two rowers, there were three voices on the boat, and the voice of their coach Robin Williams echoed on the boat as they advanced to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's doubles, becoming the first women to achieve such a feat in Britain this year.
Their dominance was quite evident, this was the 39th race of their unprecedented unbeaten streak.
While we see two great athletes floating on the surface in swanlike elegance, this image does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every paddle gold medal is a battalion of willing hands that make that difference, and no hand was as effective as their coach, who didn't know if he'd live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, they touched and left.
I had bladder cancer, a surgically-treatable form of cancer, and they did that.
If they don't, it goes everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was very lucky to be able to start treatment in the off-season, early in 2014, which is a trio, so I don't know if that's the right word for a situation like this, but it would help to minimize distractions.
I needed to get paid, so I needed to get well fast.
That was a boost to me.
I was in the hospital, and I was walking about 20 feet in the garden, even though they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but it makes him a little bigger.
After the victory, his mind was on Williams, who had a tense morning, talking a little more than usual to overcome his own worries.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery and had previously been to Afghanistan, said: "I was emotionally devastated this week, which is a bit extreme, but it really means a lot".
It just goes to show me again what this means to me and how hard Helen, me and Robin work.
I had three wonderful years with Helen and Robin.
We wouldn't be here without Robin, so I want to say thank you to her for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't think of a better person to work with or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The duo is holding a tight rhythm that their opponents cannot match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams closed the gap, Stanning and Glover were still not exhausted.
We were just caught up in the moment.
Helen was like, "Watch the process, watch the process".
It's really important not to get carried away.
We got off to a good start and we weren't trying to do anything amazing.
We didn't expect the fireworks to go off today, we just wanted to win the race we started with a good paddle, which we did.
The duo will take a year off before deciding what to do next.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, his wedding to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would put a lot of pressure on me.
It took me six months to realize I was an Olympic champion in London.
This was so new, and I was so stressed.
Here, this lasted about four minutes.
It feels so much better".

Bulgaria releases inflation figures for first time in 8 months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was at 1% in June.
This is the highest value seen in years (since June 2012), but the first value seen above zero since October after a positive 0.2% value last year.
The average annual inflation rate measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (compared to July 2016 and December 2015) was -0.2% and the monthly inflation rate between July 2016 and July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, price increases were observed in the following consumer product groups: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in the clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, home equipment and routine care (0.5%) and healthcare (0.1%) groups.
Prices in the alcohol and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education groups remained the same.
Snapchat's "anime" effect was criticized as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat said it was inspired by anime for this filter, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
Snapchat is using a lens tool to allow 150 million users every day to play with their identities at an absurd level, changing reality.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that jumped out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are reckless, character-altering devices that generate over 30 million enhanced gravitations every day.
Wrong steps are quickly etched into the public memory.
Snapchat lenses have faced accusations in the past that the app promotes black classification or presents whitened skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So, because of the lens they introduced this week, which leaves users with squinting eyes, broken teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics have criticized the company as a "mask of Asia" that caricatures Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring conflicts pointed to a larger problem with the company's diversity.
News and outrage spread with news from The Verge and Motherboard on Wednesday, and a day later Snapchat announced it was removing the feature.
The company made a statement: The lens was not designed to caricature Asians, but to honor anime characters.
But for observers with experience with racism, the lens reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others generally rejected the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "painful and uncomfortable in the slightest".
"It's difficult to argue when it comes to comparing the effects of bad Asian caricature and the filter side by side.
Which means the filter is not just an Asian mask, but a degrading Asian mask.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's overcoming cultural triggering mechanisms.
American culture seems to be in a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusiveness in many areas, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the broad youth audience that Snapchat is addressing, which is more racially diverse than its peers, could also be interpreted as having a higher expectation of sensitivity.
In an interview on Thursday, Katie Zhu, 25, said that when one of Snapchat's lenses created a demeaning image for a user, "it's much harder to not be noticed like it used to be".
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and appealed to everyone to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she stated that she believes race-related conflicts reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Ms. Zhu ended her article by criticizing the company's leadership team, which is mostly white men, with a hashtag: #SnapchatiSilin.
"Either they are able to make these decisions because of the lack of racial diversity among their staff", said Ms. Zhu, a Chinese-American, "or they are not safe or comfortable enough to talk about it even though they have people of different races working there".
Other observers share his views on the complaint, which Snapchat largely left unanswered.
The company does not share any figures on diversity among its staff, emphasizing its private company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to share the racial origins of its staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently added a hiring manager internally to increase its focus on underrepresented populations and its efforts to include them.
Ms. Zhu, for her part, stated that she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to tell them that this is not true".
The Congress panel said that the military authorities destroyed the intelligence of ISIS
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said U.S. Central Command officials had distorted intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of events on the ground regarding the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
An interim report by a task force composed of Republican House chairs from the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts who said their superiors had changed their assessments of the Islamic State by American forces.
Central Command, also known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A news release on the report stated: "Intelligence findings confirmed by senior Centcom leaders typically paint a more positive picture than facts on the ground about U.S. counterterrorism efforts and consistently provide much more positive results than analyses produced by other elements of the intelligence community".
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, "What happened at Centcom is unacceptable, our combat troops are suffering while poor analysis is being presented to senior decision makers".
Leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report, which included a description and analysis of the Central Command's training efforts by the United States to Iraqi forces, also details the persistent problems in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the report to be changed, analysts reportedly felt pressure from Centcom leaders to offer a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.
The report states that "in the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than actual events".
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military offensive to retake Mosul could be launched as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this matter has been made quite clear", said Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the most senior intelligence leaders in the United States Central Command manipulated the intelligence results of the command to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a task force after learning that analysts had expressed concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
As the reviews continue, the report, released Thursday, will follow with much more comprehensive findings.
There is another Centcom intelligence investigation being conducted by the inspector general of the Department of Defense.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee also published their own findings Thursday, which are consistent with some of the conclusions reached by the Republican task force.
The committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, said in a statement that "between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an extremely narrow-minded process in intelligence assessments about ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces".
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "delayed the release of intelligence findings", led to a breakdown in morale among analysts, and "did not provide sufficient room for dissent".
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had not found any evidence that the White House pressured Centcom analysts to fabricate the findings into a "predetermined or political narrative".
The preliminary results of the congressional review were published by the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector general investigation was underway following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's review was ongoing.
However, he said "experts may disagree on the interpretation of complex data in some cases, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense support healthy dialogue on these important national security issues".
The investigation will resonate beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria continues (a claim that is being made by more and more Defense officials every day).
But last year's accusations raised questions about how much President Obama can trust Central Command to make honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflection began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article that the administration of President George W. Bush advocated keeping a small force in Iraq despite the objections of many analysts, and stated that it had not thought enough of the post-2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the Islamic State intelligence-related insurgency.
Authorities said that despite public statements to the contrary last year, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that airstrikes on ISIL-controlled refineries had not significantly affected the terrorist group's financial resources, as they had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But as The Times reported in September, the finding has not gone outside of Central Command.
General Lloyd J. Austin III, then commander of Centcom, was criticized last year for a Senate statement that many lawmakers viewed as an extremely positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.
The USA women 's field hockey team , preparing to face Great Britain , has won its fourth consecutive victory .
Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team in the Americans' 3-0 win over India on Thursday, a day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan.
Although five goals in two games seems to require a remarkable skill, Bam (27) said he wasn't sure if he'd done the same before.
He said, "I have no idea".
I'm not one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
What he knows is that the Americans are 4-0 up in the Olympic tournament and share the top spot in the group with Britain, who went undefeated after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face off in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have qualified for the quarter-finals, and the match will determine who finishes first and second in the six-team group matches.
The team that finishes first in their group matches will not face the strong Dutch team, leader of another group, for a little longer when the quarterfinals begin.
But after Saturday's game, the Americans have made a sensational comeback here after finishing last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick at age 3 (his twin sister Drexel was interested in the sport) and joined the national team at age 16, becoming the youngest player on the team.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he didn't make the final squad.
Then came 2012 when most things didn't go right for him and his teammates.
The following year, an English coach, Craig Parnham, was brought in and things began to change.
Bam says, "It's a cultural change, a mental change, a physical change".
We don't work like we did in London anymore.
We've been through a complete transformation.
On Thursday night, Bam took the first number of the first half with a close-in reverse shot.
India had not yet won a match in the tournament but the team showed a surprising level of resilience and managed to keep the score 1-0 until Bam entered the third quarter.
He made a long run with the ball from the left side of the field and then he curved and threw it into the goal, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final touchdown in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first match of the tournament in which United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who allowed one goal in his first three victories, did not score.
He's got a chance.
So is Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place now", but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline Quiet in the Midst of Olympic Ambition
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics are still going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious competition and work that seems to never end or be inevitable.
The Olympic torch itself is like a flaming baton that is passed from swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can't watch TV, you can't read the newspaper, or you can't listen to your neighbor in a cafe without hearing about the fight between Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, a first-time Olympian, with sponsorships and TV commercials telling you to feel good, a heart-pounding, glamorous swimmer, gymnast or fencing star may be one of the names on prime time.
But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for the gold medal in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Away from the center, in part in the shade, there are sports not universally recognized: air rifle shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
The frog will always be with us, and we hope it will be for a long time.
But if I may say my personal favorite, I'd like to point out the hidden magic of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been recognized as an Olympic event since it was introduced at the Sydney Games in 2000, very few people I've asked in the 16 years since have realized that it's an Olympic sport.
This could be regional ignorance.
The United States sent athletes to compete, but it never won a medal in trampoline and did not have a competitor reaching the finals until 2012.
In the men's case, the Chinese and Russians tended to share the prizes, while in the women's case, the Chinese and Canadians tended to share.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medals in London this year.
But the trampoline is a somewhat underrated activity, perhaps partly because it's thought by unconscious ears to be worthy of clown school rather than the Olympics.
I must admit, I'm no expert on the subject, I'm just interested.
It has comic potential (like the cartoon-like tremor created by never-ending jumping) but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word for hand trampoline, which means "trampoline".
The champion candidates jump almost 30 feet in the air on a large trampoline and are asked to perform a series of movements (turning, pike and jump) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are judged on performance, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries will compete in Rio, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common progression in the Olympics is the straight forward.
Hoping to win a medal, the gold-diggers must go farther, faster and higher, in some cases to the finish line, in other cases backwards, up and down, with movements.
They're not just chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but there's another challenging line on TV: the world or Olympic record.
This determined effort is noble, ambitious, and even extreme enough to make even an audience cry.
But that's exactly the kind of thing I find a little tiresome watching the Games.
The trampoline gives you a break from all that.
The ones on the trampoline move upwards.
Their goal is not forward movement.
It jumps up, looks weightless like an astronaut, goes up, comes down, and then goes up again effortlessly.
Of course, there's no competition or challenge, but there's a routine of hard work to get to the end, no getting lost in the distance, just the graceful suspension of time and gravity, like a dream.
It's as quiet as an Olympic event can be.
The women's qualifying and then the finals will be held Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday again at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals in the afternoon block beginning at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
They promise a quiet and wonderful moment to be ignored in the public square, right in the middle of the Olympic frenzy.
And if awareness is to grow, as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested, by the United States' male gymnasts offering male athletes only for eye-popping and objectification, we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for his new fans.
"A generation in protest" in Ethiopia, longtime US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce resistance from the government.
Witnesses say a number of protesters were fatally shot in clashes with police.
Ethiopia is about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has become one of the most stable nations in Africa and a solid ally for the West with its fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have spread to more and more areas, shaking the country.
Just last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response has been quite brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed a number of unarmed protesters.
The video of the protest, believed to be from late last year or early this year, shows security officials whipping teenagers who are forced to stand with their hands against a wall.
The highest-ranking United Nations human rights official is now calling for a full investigation.
Rashid Abdi, project director of the International Crisis Group, a research group, said: "It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward".
Ethiopia is one of the most populous nations in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat the terrorist threat in the region, especially Somalia, and there are few countries in Africa that have received this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
The infrastructure has been improved effectively; there is even a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia did not exhibit the best example of democracy (human rights groups constantly cite the government's repressive attitude), opposition within the country was quite limited, and dissent was effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven to the most distant corners of the desert.
But that may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia, said, "These things happen if you drown people and give them no choice but to protest".
Youth is all about protest.
A generation in protest.
There are many complaints, from land use to the pressure on power exerted by the ruling coalition.
After the highly criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies took the last seat filled by the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea, a sharp and contentious line that led to a war in June that killed hundreds.
Analysts fear that separatist groups like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have disappeared in recent years, could take advantage of this turbulence to rearm.
There are several factors that explain why the painful emotions that had simmered beneath the surface for years are now erupting.
The first one seems innocent: smartphones.
With the proliferation of low-cost smartphones and the availability of internet service, only a few years ago, large numbers of Ethiopians started using social media to communicate.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does during protests, most people were able to communicate through proxy servers that hid their location.
A few young Ethiopians said they were gathered for the protests.
Second, there was also increased solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and Amhara.
The Oromo and Amhara are not normally allies.
For too long, the Amhara people from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia have been prominent in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo people, who are mostly Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader, said, "We are moving towards coming together under one umbrella and cooperating".
The largest protests were seen in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third cause of the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Meles served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was thought to be a tactical genius who saw what others couldn't.
Analysts say he's particularly adept at spotting the first signs of unrest and calming and neutralizing rivals.
"The current regime does not have this basic knowledge", said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn was elected in relative uncertainty to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who is from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he has failed to win the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.
The result was more fear and more bloodshed.
Ethiopia's latest experience of this kind of turmoil was in 2005 when thousands of people protested following the thefts by analysts following a rigged election by the government.
In the measures that followed, many protesters were killed, although less than in the previous month, and this period of turmoil passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train, and for significant progress in fighting poverty.
But this has clearly not stopped the growing hatred of the Ethiopian government.
And it's becoming dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked Tigrayan-owned businesses, and Tigrayan hatred is also on the rise on social media.
Analysts say the protests have left the United States and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, but recently it was reported that the base was closed.
While the West is clearly committed to democracy, it does not want to see this already fragile regional ally disintegrated.
"It's", said Mr. Abdi, adding, "like walking on a very thin rope".
Donald Trump called Obama's claim of founding ISIS "ridiculous"
Donald J. Trump on Friday sought to defuse the latest dispute surrounding his campaign by insisting several times last week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not serious about claiming to be the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This statement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
He also put his representatives in a strange position in the process of trying to explain that this was not what he was implying, who did everything they could to defend him in this tumultuous process.
Mr. Trump, after making the suggestion at a rally Wednesday night, reinforced his thesis Thursday, insisting in interviews that the president and Mrs. Clinton were indeed implying that they founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Mr. Trump said he was only making a sarcastic remark.
The submission showed that Mr. Trump had completely backtracked from the day before he had stated in a series of interviews that he was serious about this accusation.
Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt reminded Mr. Obama that he wanted to destroy ISIS, and when Mr. Trump tried to help him soften that comment, the Republican presidential candidate said he didn't believe it.
Mr. Trump's latest disruption came as he tried to shift the focus of his campaign in the wake of the drop in the polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made conflicting economic speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to get back to that.
He tweeted again that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used the defense of cynicism before.
In late July, after facing heavy criticism for making a statement suggesting that the Russians were hacking into Mrs. Clinton's emails, she explained the comments, saying, "Of course I said that in a sarcastic way".
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political speech and step back where necessary.
Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who tracks the language used by both candidates, said, "It's a scheme that allows him to 'explain' in some way depending on the response, by testing how certain messages are reacted to by those who support him".
But he also knows that he's making these statements deliberately and that they're too vague to filter through different lenses.
After the recent decline in opinion polls, Mr. Trump has taken a much more aggressive stance than to soften the mood for the general election crowd.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton well behind in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and there is a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump usually avoids apologizing for provocative remarks, he accuses his critics of misrepresenting his words or misunderstanding his humor.
But Mr. Trump's jokes, which have come under much more scrutiny in the final months of his presidential campaign, leave his loyal supporters, however provocative his comments may be, in a difficult position to publicly support him.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, did his best to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
When asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, "I think he's making a legitimate, political criticism".
In a way, before Obama, ISIS was a small, unknown organization, and those who thought they were cute were completely wrong, and that's because the troops were being withdrawn from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, which Mrs. Clinton ran as Secretary of State, failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and caused the growth of ISIS.
Ahead of Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to tweet accusing the news media of distorting every word and biasing him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television experts trying to solve him, saying, "They can't do that!"
Some Democrats have mocked Mr. Trump's excuse, saying it is evidence that he is unfit for the presidency.
We're back at Greenpoint, the once-untouchable coffee shop.
Verb Cafe, an old cash-only place in Williamsburg, served great coffee for 15 years, even though it didn't offer Wi-Fi.
Naturally, he couldn't handle the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
In the summer of 2014, the store that replaced Verb, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
Residents of the area lamented that this was the last loss of a civilized city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, "New York is change, I know that, but I still can't believe CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel is being vacated and Verb is a soap shop".
But New York is a city of change as much as it is of reinvention.
Last November, a revamped Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but retains some former employees and a similarly simple air.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verb is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who is also the owner and general manager of the new location.
He joined Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When a client offered him financing for this new place, he said he'd be excited to do it.
Mr. Rodriguez, 36, left most of it the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for the sims and bought an espresso machine of the same model.
Even the old Verb's lights were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer a little bit of a different experience.
He added new material.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and ingredients such as capers and pickled onions are also served.
There are bowls of brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer but offers fresh juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed the old routines were steadily coming in.
He said, "Many of our former customers couldn't handle the prices in Williamsburg".
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Ms. Oliveira, 34, lives in Williamsburg and was a frequent visitor to Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he didn't give up on this path.
He said he took a break from coffee for a while after Verb shut down.
"I realized what I loved was the coffee and culture at Verb", she said.
Now he's started drinking coffee again, but the other day he opted for a new addition to his regular iced coffee, a straw coffee.
Another regular, Tom Rosenthal, has been a regular at Verb since 2003.
He goes there before work and always orders the same thing.
"Every day, at quarter past seven, I would go in and they would make my daily order of buttermilk simit", she said.
The photographer, Mr. Rodriguez, said he wanted to make a change and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Mr. Rosenthal still takes his usual order, but sometimes he makes a few changes to his daily order of ham, eggs and cheese.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't upset about the soap shop that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cold brew coffee from the cafe.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer".
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have taken over this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said that he would soon find a space to display it so his new neighbors would feel comfortable.
There are other advantages to the new location.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell the cold brew.
There's a possibility the cafe could be expanding into the adjacent building.
For most customers, it's enough to have a new verb available to find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and was very upset when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Mr. Whitt said that being able to walk in and get coffee made him feel at home.
"I had to smell this", he said.
In the book "A Square Meal",
In March of 1933, shortly after taking his seat as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, a throat-loving man, loved fancy Fifth Avenue foods like goose liver and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and dried peas for dessert.
"It was a solidarity act with people in distress about food", said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat".
Couple from Brooklyn Heights, food historian.
Mr. Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Ms. Ziegelman's book, "97 Orchard", was about living in the slums of the Lower East Side through food.
Their new book, "A Square Meal", which they're working on together, and will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They, in turn, showed solidarity with the food community by meeting a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in business since 1929, the year the crisis began.
Mrs. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a sandwich with cream cheese and olives, while Mr. Coe, 57, preferred turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's order of meatballs appropriate for discussing their Crisis meal.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "The beans were very popular".
There was peanut sauce, liver sauce, dried bean sauce.
They were made of a material and a cheap thing that spread the material.
Imagine you've had enough peanuts for dinner.
Mr. Coe, he's got a sour face.
"It must have been sitting in your stomach like a bullet", he said.
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, tables in America were like an open buffet.
Women cooked for the men who worked on the farm, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
During World War I, Americans sent food to starving Europeans. "A Square Meal" tells the story of how the nation coped with its sudden decline from being a center of abundance.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it: "It was a time when food became a central concern for Americans".
The new budget regime was equally worrying: Mystery foods such as salmon and stews became staples, which, according to Mrs. Ziegelman, "made stews a great way to evaluate leftover food" so that cooks could hide the appetizing ingredients at the bottom with a cream sauce coating.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Over the years, meat, the centerpiece of American cuisine, has become a luxury that is shared with a sense of humor.
Interesting blends were tried for calorie and nutritional value, and feelings of satiety took precedence over taste or general culinary understanding.
While Mrs. Ziegelman was researching her book, which included recipes, she prepared a peanut butter-filled onion stew from that period.
Mr. Coe said, "This was not a favorite addition to the dinner table".
Ms. Ziegelman endorsed it: "It was surreal".
Peanut butter has nothing in common with baked onions.
It was a feature that was prominent in most home economics recipes.
From 1923 to 1943, home economists, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Household Economics, steered the nation's eating habits like never before.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "economic" and spread the campaign to turn puzzles into tasty foods, such as spaghetti with carrot and cream.
A Square Meal is a feast of historic delicacies.
The government's response to starving citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's "let's eat cake" attitude, is extremely appetizing.
While he was publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse food of his childhood, he was eating like the millionaire intellectual he became.
Mr. Coe said, "He liked to eat European food, like fish with a sauce of cucumber".
He ate his dinner in a dining room almost entirely gold-plated, wearing evening jackets.
It was far from the truth.
If his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to be an example with his stomach, President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake.
The book relates that Mrs. Roosevelt hired an assistant who had no regard for taste, and the White House began to serve "not only the saddest meals ever prepared but also the most gloomy dishes ever prepared".
After the country got back on its feet, many of the crisis-era cooking methods were abandoned.
According to Ms. Ziegelman, the understanding of calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking continues.
The couple stated that while writing the book, they learned a lot from Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - for example, she never threw her food in the trash.
Mr. Coe said, "The food waster really scared him".
Mrs. Ziegelman said of her old memories, "It really made people sick".
There was a case of the cream doughnut.
After the plates were collected at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe brought out a homemade dessert: the peanut-dried dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "It's called a whipped pear", and added that the trick was to give these modest recipes a cool name.
No whipped cream; just dried berries, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone hesitantly dipped their brown sticky puzzle spoon.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoons.
As if he could afford it, he said to his wife, "A little chopped walnut would be nice".
In the fight between Merck and the hepatitis C patent, Gilead will collect attorney fees.
A U.S. district judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. has won the right to collect attorney fees in a hepatitis C patent case against drugmaker Merck & Co. Inc.
After a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of a series of misconduct, including perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead was reduced in June from paying $200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni.
At Thursday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled that Gilead is entitled to compensation for costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, the market leader, with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of laboratory work on the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs, sofosbuvir.
US-backed forces say they have completely taken control of Memphis from Islamic State.
On Friday, a group spokesman said US-backed forces had taken full control of the northern city of Memphis, near the Turkish border, as well as the last Islamic State fighters in the city.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG) are clearing the city after a group of remaining militants who are hiding in the city left.
Sharfan Derviş of the Membich Military Council, which is allied with the SDG, told Reuters that they had released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are cleaning up".
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% in federal taxes.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax return, which shows the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband earned $10.75 million last year and paid federal taxes at the current rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to charities, most of them to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million from speaking fees, and the former Secretary of State reported $3 million in income for his book published by Simon & Schuster about his time at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, has released his 10-year tax returns with his wife, Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid 20.3% in federal taxes.
Clinton campaign manager Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement, "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency".
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses about his earlier promises to file tax returns and backtracking.
Although not required by law, it is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to file tax returns publicly.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers argued that the reason for the refusal to release the statements was an audit by the Internal Revenue Service.
In connection with the Democratic nominee's statements, Clinton campaign manager Ian Sams tweeted, "It's your turn".
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that Trump would not allow them to air until the audits were complete.
The group, which has criticized Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said the rejection raised questions about his selflessness, contributions to charities, business deals and many other connections, including those with Russia.
Clinton went on the record on Friday by posting an online video showing senior Republicans pressuring Trump to declare his taxes.
He raised the issue at an economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
He told the crowd, "He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, to release tax returns".
Politico reported that Trump paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times business columnist shared testimony from a number of tax lawyers and accountants that the situation may still be that way.
Federal tax rates have become a major issue in the presidential election.
Clinton introduced a bill named after billionaire investor Warren Buffet that would require those earning more than $1 million a year to pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Obama is supporting this proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, who runs the Berkshire Hathaway group there, challenged Trump to come forward and file a tax return.
Buffett said he was also under IRS scrutiny and that Trump was "afraid" of voters, not the IRS.
Clinton released his campaign tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who currently live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, with a combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton family's 2015 statement shows that, unlike most Americans, their income comes from salaries at just $100.
Their primary investment is a low-cost index fund, and the Clintons have reported a net income of $109,000 in cash and interest.

Red pepper condoms, chestnut fireworks, and powdered red pepper are helping conserve elephants in Tanzania
To prevent elephants from entering human settlements, conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method - throwing condoms filled with red pepper powder at them.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, and the U.S.-based Nature Conservancy Association have taken steps to promote it, training volunteers in rural areas of northern Tanzania on the use of the nonviolent, four-step method of protecting their homes and crops from harm to animals.
Before, most people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
Honeyguide's managing director Damian Bell said in a statement: "Since we developed the toolkit, we have seen a change in attitudes in these communities, who are now more confident in their ability to keep elephants out of their areas without harming them".
The first two steps involve holding the elephant lantern and blowing the horn.
In cases where that's not possible, what's called a "red pepper cloud" is thrown out.
Red pepper powder mixed with soil is placed in a condom with a chestnut spark plug, only the tip is closed so that the funnel is exposed.
When it burns, the condom opens with a blast and red pepper is sprayed into the air.
One breath is enough to send the elephants in the opposite direction.
The last resort is to use a hook that fires fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker knocks down hotel in Berlin that removed Israel's phone code at Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin caused a media sensation after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's telephone code and that the employee was pushing the "demands" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the documentary "Shoah" about the Holocaust, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German broadcaster FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the phone code list provided by the hotel during his recent stay.
But the country wasn't among the states that could be searched directly from the room.
In 2016, in the capital of the new Germany, Berlin, how can Israel be excluded and destroyed?
It was Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol is offering you the ability to call Israel from its own call center.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel reception for an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that the response "shocked him".
The hotel's secretary said the move was "a deliberate decision by the Kempinski-Hotels management".
The reason behind this move made the filmmaker even more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, "Many of our guests asked for the removal of the Arab and Israeli code".
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the situation "a great shame".
We were horrified and surprised.
This is a real shame.
It's a much bigger scandal that this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this.
That doesn't need explaining.
We expect the hotel to draw the necessary conclusions from this", the official said.
The incident caused a huge reaction online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some have accused the Kempinski Hotel of "bowing" to the so-called demands of Arab customers.
Another post said "You should be ashamed" and emphasized that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly dismissed the accusations, saying the incident was the result of "negligence" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reported that one of Kempinski's representatives said that "there was never a direct order to exclude Israel from the fast-track list".
And he said they've added the code now.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against Brazilian student protesters
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday to protest against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against the protesters.
The problem began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the use of plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students joined the demonstration to express their displeasure with the plans.
According to a proposal by São Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be sent to other schools in order to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest came days after protesters took to the streets in large numbers to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff, who was voted out of office by the country's Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased to 71% - RT Business
According to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, with the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown by 70.9 percent year on year.
The ambassador said that since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, the interest of Russian companies doing business in the country has increased significantly.
While new companies are preparing to gain market access, Russian companies are maintaining existing ties with Iran.
Of course, further increase in trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran", Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, he said, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
This increase in trade was provided by machinery, land tools and materials for weapons".
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly for travel.
Also, for the first time, Iran has entered the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say that the Iranian tourist record of visiting Russia last year will be broken".
At the same time, relatively fewer Russians visit Iran, which is something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved", he said.
Cash to FETÖ from Izmir
Interesting details have started to emerge about Abdullah Kavuklar Group Chairman and Ahmet Küçükbay Group Chairman who were detained for providing financial support to FETÖ.
It was found that the FETÖ's financial sources number 1 and 2 in Izmir, Küçükbay and Kavuk, regularly sent a large amount of money to FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization head Fethullah Gülen every month.
To avoid being registered, it was found that the money sent to Gülen was not deposited through banks, but sent by courier.
On the other hand, 9 people were arrested and sent to court as part of the investigation into the FETÖ coup attempt in Amasya, including Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman Fatih Altınay, and 7 were released on the condition of judicial control.
30 thousand liras in the pocket in 10 years
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call to "lower interest" has set banks into action.
It was suggested that banks be included in the campaign attack initiated by Real Estate Housing and later joined by GYODER.
The proposal to reduce the housing loan interest rates to below 1 percent, which is considered a psychological limit, was also made by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
13 banks have lowered their mortgage rates below 1%.
It was the public banks that started the discount craze.
Based on the monthly interest rates that used to vary between 1.12 and 1.29 percent, the consumer who uses a 10-year term housing loan will pay less interest between 15 and 30 billion TL.
Choice 5 to 10 years
So how much will the interest rate cut benefit homebuyers?
A person who uses a loan of 100 thousand liras with a term of 10 years will benefit from a decrease in interest of 30 thousand liras.
Most people who take out a home loan choose a five- to 10-year repayment plan.
Interest rates are expected to fall further in the coming days.
The interest rate cut will also have a positive impact on sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 percent compared to the previous year, to 1 million 289 thousand.
Sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million this year with a discount on interest.
GYODER Chairman Aziz Torun: Annual should be lowered below 9 percent
It's a big step for public banks to go for a rate cut.
They took our president's call and cut interest.
But that rate has to be below 9 percent a year.
If this discount continues, we're also considering extending our 0.70 percent monthly campaign for a few months.
The campaign could be extended for another three months
The banks' participation in this effort to revive the economy, which we limit to one month, could lead to an extension of this historic campaign by at least three to four months.
But the interest rate on the loan needs to be below 9 percent a year.
It's gratifying to see that this is not only creating positive psychology in the housing sector and the real market, and unprecedented solidarity, but also that every sector is making sacrifices in the purchase of housing for citizens.
We expect full support from the banks
It's a good move for our president to go to the banks for a rate cut.
Besides, there are steps being taken to revive the economy in all sectors.
The NGOs' campaigns, the decision of the Central Bank and all the steps taken in this direction are for the country...
All banks need to put their hands up.
We're telling them to come, join us in this movement, walk with us, on the same path, together, let's give life to the economy.
Investment of 5.5 billion TL from Sabancı in 1.5 years
Sabancı Holding increased its net profit by 11 percent to 1 billion 353 million liras in the first six months of this year, and its sales increased by 22 percent to 17 billion 166 million liras.
Sabancı Holding CEO Zafer Kurtul said that they invested 1.8 billion TL in the first six months of the year, and about 5.5 billion Liras since the beginning of 2015.
Kurtul said, "We have successfully passed through a difficult turning point as a country in the recent period".
"After this, it's time to work and produce more for our country", he said.
Two years of vacation from Kabataş to enjoy the boat
The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB) has closed the Kabataş shipping docks for about two years due to the "Kabataş Challenge, Transfer Center and Docks Renewal Construction" project.
A modern transfer center will be built on the coast of Kabataş, integrating sea, rail system and road transport.
Traffic will be underground, allowing uninterrupted foot traffic along the coast.
Tram and funicular systems will continue to operate for some time.
Ring rides will be launched to ensure that citizens can reach the Taksim, Eminönü, Beşiktaş regions.
Interest rates are down, house prices are up.
A friend of mine, a bank manager, texted me.
It's always the same.
Interest rates are falling, house prices are going up.
Interest rates are going up, house prices are going down.
He says, "Look, here it is again".
He's talking about his feelings about his work in personal loans.
He says that the contractors who are in the 0.70 percent campaign organized by Real Estate Housing are raising prices in many housing projects.
I was just checking to see if there was any truth to it.
There's no condition, there's nothing more than sex...
I remembered a conversation with a contractor who was attending a construction summit organized by our newspaper a week after the Fethullahist terrorist organization attempted a coup on July 15.
He's the boss of a big firm.
When I heard the contractor, who I won't name, say, "You really need to raise prices by 10 percent", I said, "You're going to do a hit-and-run?"
After the coup attempt, with a campaign led by Real Estate Housing, the builders launched a major sales campaign with 0.70 percent and 120 months' notice.
I admit, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, took a risk.
But since we are moving in a spirit of unity and solidarity to keep Turkey moving.
The banks have also supported your month-long campaign by cutting interest rates.
Then no one should take advantage of a raise.
And warn those who do it among you.
President Erdogan received Ömer Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan received Ömer Mehmet Koç, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Koç Holding, and Ali Koç, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Koç Holding and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Otosan.
Erdogan's reception with the press in the Presidential Palace took place behind closed doors for 40 minutes.
Call from BDDK: Complain to those banks
Mehmet Ali Akben, the head of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority (BDDK), made a statement on President Erdogan's warning to banks to "recall credit".
Akben said, "If banks turn the recall into an opportunism and use different measures due to market conditions, we will definitely not allow it".
We tell those who bring us such complaints and information, 'Call the BDDK complaint line, name the bank and company.'
President Tayyip Erdogan warned banks in a statement yesterday: "I say that when interest rates fall, when credit facilities are expanded, a new era will open up in front of our country and investors and banks".
Let alone refusing to lend in this period of our country, the banks who recall loans with fabricated excuses have set a line for themselves, I want to announce this.
And when interest rates were 7-8% a year, banks made money off of it.
More than 500 thousand Russian tourists are expected
Ali Kızıldağ, President of the Professional Hotel Managers Association (POYD), said at a meeting held at the EXPO 2016 Antalya exhibition area that Turkey-Russia relations had entered a positive route before the July 15 coup attempt, that scheduled flights from Russia to Antalya had started and that there was a certain revival in tourism.
"I expect there will be very positive developments in all sectors, from tourism and agriculture to food, from construction to textiles", said Kızıldağ, who said that the meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin excited the tourism sector as well as the sectors that trade between the two countries.
Turkey and Russia are two very close countries, we have traditional relations based on years.
"I think if we as sectors make very fast progress along the path that the leaders of the two countries have opened, we can close the distances and go towards the goals as soon as possible", he said.
Reddağ said that if the coup had not happened, the number of Russian tourists in Turkey would have exceeded 1 million.
But we lost a month during what we call high season, so we're cutting our target.
I still think we'll be over 500,000 if charter flights start.
The season may also extend into late October or even mid-November.
In that case, we could add extra flights for Christmas.
I imagine this positive atmosphere will be appreciated by the Russian people.
They have a longing for Turkey.
Hopefully, with this speed, we can push 700,000.
Expressing hope for the Russian market in 2017, Kzyldag said that if the relations between the two countries and the Russian economy recover, the number of Russian tourists could again exceed 3 million next year.
"There are returns in cancelled reservations, new reservations have started to be taken", said POYD Chairman Kızıldag, who said that with the lifting of the ban on public personnel's permits, domestic reservations have started little by little.
"We have a hopeful outlook on the Sacrifice Festival".
Reddydag said that the ban on travel agencies was a positive development after the coup attempt.
Do you have a new one with an existing loan?
First, check with your lender to see how the new interest rates will affect your loan.
Calculate the cost of using a new loan at a lower interest rate, along with the early-payment fee (typically between 1.5 and 2 percent of the applicable fee), from your bank.
If you still have an advantage when you include all the costs, you can apply for a low-interest loan.
No breathing for the lion!
The last champion Beşiktaş aims to enter the new season with morale by winning the Super Cup match against Galatasaray.
Technical Director Shenol Güneş, who has all his plans on winning, said in a meeting with his students, "We have to play fast and aggressive".
"I expect you to have a high passing percentage and ball control for 90 minutes".
It turned out that Shenol Güneş, who had no intention of sending players who missed training, including Sosa, to the field, was undecided about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced coach tried Necip in the weekly training but Tosic will be in the stop position if Adriano plays left back.
The Sun, who will also have to choose between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also had its students do a long-distance standing ball practice.
Tolga is gonna blow up - Sports News
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek answered the questions of the media at the dinner hosted by NEF, the sponsor of Galatasaray, and supported the expatriate footballer Tolga Giegerci, whose transfer and annual salary are the subject of discussion.
I 'm not the footballers who 'll talk .
Dursun Özbek, who said that the football team is in a much better position than last year, said: "Yet it is not me who should be talking about this, it is the players who should be talking about it on the pitch", adding: "I cannot say anything".
I'll see the teams in two or three weeks, then I can tell you our chances of winning the championship.
I'm waiting for the blast from Tolga.
You'll see Tolga with his posture, his physique, he's gonna blow this year, everybody's gonna be watching.
Galatasaray President stressed that they contacted Mehmet Topal during the transfer period but that they would intervene if he did not agree with his club and said: "We were not in charge of the price so that our competitor would increase".
Mehmet the lame gentleman, a master athlete.
If he hadn't gotten a deal with his club, we'd have transferred him to Galatasaray.
RIVA and the BANK DEBTS will be paid off
Uzbek said that they will soon start building a hall next to the TT Arena.
But our president said, 'Build a hall for 15,000 people.'
We changed the project.
We'll use the money from Riva to pay off the bank debt.
We are the Mayans
Galatasaray President Dursun Özbek, who said he believed that the team that won the Turkish Cup last season would show its quality in the final of the Super Cup against Beşiktaş tomorrow, made his claim with a phrase that was a slogan in the yellow-red club.
President Özbek said that Galatasaray will be champions again after a year break.
The travel ban has been lifted.
The Club Association Foundation signed a historic resolution at its meeting yesterday.
The July 15 coup attempt was the agenda of the meeting, and the decision was made to lift the travel ban.
From the new season, the fans of the guest team will be able to take their places in the stands in the matches between the four majors and the Beşiktaş-Bursaspor matches.
"We decided to lift the travel ban in order to continue the unity and solidarity that was formed after July 15", said Göksel Gümüşdağ, the Foundation's President.

On the other hand, the result of the vote in the Clubs Association Foundation stated that the current board of directors will continue in its function.
Galatasaray Club President Dursun Özbek was elected as chairman.
Unlike previous meetings, there were no club flags on the table.
The table was decorated with Turkish flags to emphasize the unity and unity of Turkey.
"We Will Clean Ourselves"
"We have no luxury of taking FETÖ's formation lightly", said Göksel Gümüşdağ, President of the Clubs Association, who said that those who tried to treacherously attack Turkey's indivisible integrity found the great Turkish nation in front of them.
"As a football family, we have to clean and tidy our own yard", he said.
Gümüşdağ responded to a question in the form of "Do you think about an organization under the name of the 15 July Democracy Cup?" and "Especially the name of the Turkey Cup has a general opinion of friends".
He used the phrase "We will share this offer with TFF".
The target is 25,000 combines.
Trabzonspor will compete in the new season in the new stadium.
The president of the boardomazi who counted days to move to Akyazi, Muharrem Usta, determined the combined prices with an opinion poll he conducted on social media.
The new season is expected to see a lot of interest from fans.
The President Master, "The target is 25,000 combines and over 100,000 uniforms".
We've agreed on prices behind the fort and east/west stands with survey responses.
Good luck to you.

President Aziz Yildirim and the board of directors held a meeting with the club's Coordinator of Financial Affairs Tamer Yelkovan.
The economic dimension of the matter was discussed at the meeting.
According to the agreement with UEFA, Yildirim, who acted sensitively to keep the "annual loss" at a level, was reported to have received help from Yelkovan in financial matters.
Pereira's representatives have been contacted.
He's been notified of his termination.
The agreement is for 2-2.5 thousand EUR.
There are still some unresolved issues in financial matters, so the official announcement will be made today or tomorrow.
Pereira and his team went to practice yesterday without an official announcement.
The total cost of this operation was around 4 million euros.
However, it was stated that F.Bahçe will provide a figure below this price for the termination.
If F. Bahce pays Pereira's salary in advance, he will finish a figure between 2 and 2.5 million euros.
If Pereira doesn't go along with it, he'll get paid monthly.
If he gets a deal with a team, that payment will be cut.
Yes, Pereira finally left and the Fenerbahce supporter had a big revolution.
In the battle with Vitor Pereira, Caner Erkin, Luis Nani were martyred.
Robin van Persie was rescued with minor injuries.
I'm gonna be happy to see Vitor Pereira go, because I think our administration will find something worse.
My joy is in my stomach.
Since Pereira is gone, the champion is Fenerbahçe.
You can sort Vitor Pereira's suitcase with 3-5-2 and go.
Since Pereira went to Kadikoy on the 18th.
Serdar Chakr was removed from office
It was learned that Serdar Çakır, who was the top class referee observer in the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), was removed from his position.
The appointment of Serdar Chakir, who is the father of FIFA referee Cüneyt Çakır, who is currently serving at the Rio Olympics, caused controversy in the refereeing community last year...
In the past few days, the Central Arbitration Council (MHK), the Arbitration Council and the representatives and observers boards were reconstituted in the framework of FETÖ.
The icon of Van Persie's smiling face
Minutes after Pereira's claim of termination was revealed, Dutch star Robin van Persie posted a captioned post on his Facebook account.
Robin van Persie, who shared photos of himself from Fenerbahce, put a football and a smiling icon behind him.
The post was interpreted as "Glad Pereira is gone".
The first independent gold mine in history was founded by Al-Deehani.
Fehaid al-Deehani, who won first place in the double trap category in the 2016 Rio Olympics shooting event, brought the first gold medal to independent athletes in the history of the games.
Medals were awarded in the double trap category at the Olympic Shooting Center.

Al-Deehani beat his opponent 26-24 to become the first to win a gold medal with an independent team at the Olympics.
I opened a door for the headscarves
Doaa Elghobashy, an Egyptian who competed in women's beach volleyball at the 2016 Rio Olympics wearing a headscarf, said, "I respect those who play in bikinis, and my opponents in their headscarves".
Elghobashy said he wanted to break the perception of Islam that has been established in the West in recent years.
Here, athletes are fighting for their talents.
I'm getting positive messages on social media from many countries in the Islamic world.
Women in particular say, 'You inspire us, we're proud of you.'
I opened the door for women in headscarves".
"When I tell them that I wear this dress because of my religion, they are understanding", said Elghobashy, 20, an Egyptian who recalls that foreign athletes sometimes come to him and ask why he wears a closed dress.
Kazak Balandin has made history

Sun: Let's put friendship first
Beşiktaş Technical Director Şenol Güneş said that the Super Cup match will be very meaningful for the mosque because it coincides with the anniversary of the death of Suleyman Seba.
"I am convinced that in these times when we need friendship and brotherhood more than ever, friendship will be at the forefront not only on the field but also in the stands", said the experienced coach.
FETÖ chief Gulen's assets were seized
The Federal Criminal Court of Adana has filed a case against 17 suspects in the indictment prepared by the Prosecutor General's Office for Terrorism-Technical and Organized Crime Investigation for providing funding to the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization by providing for the excessive increase in the value of immovable property belonging to persons and organizations connected to FETÖ/PDY by unethically changing the value of the building plans.
In the case where Fethullah Gülen, the number one accused, was tried for 'Attempting to Subvert the Constitutional Order', the court panel issued a warrant for arrest for Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Jemal Soncu, who had fled with Gülen.
But the court decided to make the fugitive operations for the 4 defendants who have not been caught and have not come to the trials.
The 2nd High Court of Adana ruled that all assets of Fethullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Jemal Soncu, who were in a foreign country and therefore fled because they could not reach them, should be seized in order to ensure that the case against them remains inconclusive.
With this decision, the fugitive defendants' property in Turkey, land-sea and air transportation vehicles, all kinds of rights and debts, valuable documents, shares in the company where their partner is located, rental cash and bank accounts were frozen.
Hüseyin Güler: The fall of Gülen depends on the fall of three feet
Huseyin Güler made striking statements about the coup attempt by FETÖ.
The headline of Hüseyin Güler's statement is as follows:
I wrote about this in my articles for the last five or six months, as I thought they were going to try a coup, "They can try but they can't do it in the chain of command".
I didn't know two things, first, that it was so widespread and deep, for example, the commanding officer of the General Command of the Gendarmerie for eight years and the lackeys of the President.
Mr. President, the man who struggled most was careful, who knows, in choosing his puppies, but the most important feature of them all was unprecedented secrecy.
They're such hypocrites.
One of the most important pieces of evidence for the statement, "This is not the job of a retired minister like FETO", is that he has such a deep compass.
He's got the CIA's backing.
The CIA took this guy too soon.
Mahmut Över says in 2014 that in 1971 Fuat Doğu and Fethullah Gülen met at the home of Vehbi Koç.
He says that the people who were most interested in this were the people who were most closely involved with the CIA and MIT.
Our military personnel are paid by the United States, and then one guy comes out and says, "I don't remember".
When are we gonna find out, in 2014?
After Mahmut Bey's post, there was no explanation to deny it.
Like Fair Orphan, he got caught on the base, right?
I wonder who that is.
The guy went to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the hit, returned two days ago.
Since 2002, Fair Orphan has been abroad 109 times.
When you put all this together, you have to investigate who has been in the United States since March 1999 when Fethullah Gülen went to the United States.
It would seem they went to Pennsylvania for a reason.
But his real connections to the CIA can be traced back to this, especially from people who were supposed to be promoted from within the security forces, many of whom were safely sent to the United States.
WikiLeaks documents that Gulen is running a group that holds meetings with the CIA.
15 years ago, there was a study to prove that CIA ties were official.
I told you Fuat Avenue was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man who works at the Prime Minister's Office works for Fuat Avni.
But the bad news is, this information went to the CIA, just like it did to Pennsylvania.
Gulen's fall is dependent on the collapse of three legs, one of which we call the base, which was a circle of friends, some are in deep hypnosis, even this coup attempt is still a movie of Erdogan.
I was talking about three feet, a base support.
The theft of questions, theft, the defeat of slavery, it has shaken this base very much.
The other two legs: political support, international support.
International support is still there.
The only thing that will break political support is documenting that the tapes of the Baikal and MHP leaders were taken by FETÖ.
After July 15, Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu is using "FETO" as well, and it opened everyone's eyes.
He's a trickster who laughs and says, "I'm not doing it.
She says to me, "Yes, Mr. Hussein, these students have very different dreams, they send them to me, I have now banned them, because it is not right to act with dreams".
A voice recording was dropped, the person speaking in that voice recording was Barbaros Kocakurt:
One policeman was martyred in Nusaybin
According to the information received, the terrorists fired long-barreled weapons at the armored vehicle of the police who were on patrol in Selahaddin Ayyubie neighborhood.
One policeman was killed and one officer was injured in the first fire.
Two terrorists were neutralized in a confrontation that resulted in police retaliation.
The injured policeman was taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
There's an operation in the area.
He's distracted the coup plotters.
Private TV channels, which played a significant role in preventing the coup attempt on the night of July 15, continued to broadcast thanks to technical personnel who heroically resisted the coup in TurkSat.
This is the hero Asim Akkaya...
Akkaya, who said that they were going into the psychology of resistance by ordering the broadcast to be cut off, said, "I risked everything thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire that was opened from the helicopter".
They put a gun to my head and told me to cut the broadcast.
I just turned off the local TV.
Then I told them to get away from the building, telling them we had to go to the dish antennas.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna section.
"I cut some wires here again, but I didn't touch the broadcasts".
When the coup plotters failed to cut off the broadcast on TurkSat, they brought in Samanyolu TV's experts.
These terrorists were captured by police officers who arrived three minutes before the incident.
Akkaya said that when the strikers returned to the building, they received a phone call about an hour later and realized that the TV broadcasts were continuing, and that he was facing death at that moment.
I took over the night shift at 8:00.
He entrusted it to us.
A friend of mine was a guard for the e-government and the electrical system.
We were meeting for tea at about 9:00 p.m. when helicopters flew overhead at low altitude.
There were several other aircraft flying low again around the helicopter.
We saw their lights.
It was probably drones that could take pictures.
They were flying in front of the helicopters.
I've been there 11 years, first time I've seen a flight this close, I called the police.
Then a movement started.
We were watching the news and found out the bridge was closed.
At that time, our general manager instructed the security staff who were not on duty at the time to come to the building.
We went to the police station to get information and found out that all the packages of your broadcasts on TRT had fallen.
TRT was cut off for five minutes.
I tried the TRT main controller, but I couldn't reach it.
Our control station says TRT's broadcasts are back and they're starting to read the statement.
Assistant General Manager Halil Yeşilçimen asked for the immediate suspension of TRT broadcasts.
TRT 3 is broadcasting a lot, so we started working on cutting it.
We just heard Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım say there is a riot.
Our director's order to shut down TRT got us into some resistance psychology.
We cut off TRT, and after a while we heard a helicopter.
We went out, the helicopter landed on the ground, fired everywhere, everybody split up.
We hid in a building in the back.
There were 12 of us.
When we got to the back, the soldiers from the helicopter came in.
Some of our friends were captured by soldiers.
We showed up so we wouldn't leave them alone.
And then I saw them take our assistant general manager and bring him to his knees.
The soldiers were talking among themselves.
Someone said, "Let's shoot one of them, scare them".
Then they put us all in.
The commanders started shouting, "Who's in charge here, I'm not gonna ask again".
We heard the talk about 'shoot someone' and thought: we don't know about the country but we have an instruction to stop TRT.
So there's a resistance.
I felt like I was giving up on myself.
I said, "It's mine".
I got up, not knowing what to do.
All I could think about was my friends in the regiment being shot from a helicopter.
I thought that 10-15 of my friends in the regime were martyrs and I was relieved when I thought, 'They will kill us too eventually.'
Their commander said, 'You're going to cut all broadcasts except TRT.'
We have a system section that monitors local channels when they're being launched.
We're broadcasting 80 of the 200 local channels from this room.
I thought of this room.
There was no national coverage.
If I cut them off and say they're all cut off, at least until then, there's gonna be support, help from outside.
Or I said, "He'll go where he's going".
We finally agreed we couldn't get out.
I said, "I'll cut it".
I cut the antenna output of one of the local channel packages.
I cut the power switch to the monitors where we can watch the national channels.
So all the screens would say no signal.
I told him I had to go to the antennas to get it completely cut off.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, and one of the soldiers said, "Stop there".
He held the gun to my forehead.
'You're going to kill them all, except TRT, there won't be one left, and one of you I'm going to kill eventually, that's you.'
I was so upset, I said, "You'll see, they're all frozen", and I didn't say anything else.
We got into the station, I was hanging out, cutting off local broadcasts.
We're on the other antenna.
I had a system that corresponded to about 20 national channels.
When they cut off the local channels, about 20 monitors went down.
My Lord has helped us, and we have not been pressured to answer.
They believed the answers we gave.
They didn't.
That's a relief.
After they got off the antenna, they asked where the transformer was.
I said, "I don't know, I'm a TV newsman", and he said, "Are there any electricians here?"
I said, "No electrician after the evening shift, if there's a malfunction, the team will come".
Actually, there was an electrician there.
I remembered not cutting off the Cypriot broadcasts.
I was thinking of cutting them off to distract the soldiers.
They were a little relieved to think that the publications had been cut.
They couldn't think of looking at the publications.
The group is now on standby.
About an hour later, they turned on the TV in the waiting room and saw A News.
He came in, soldier.
'My commander said A News did not stop broadcasting.'
We've been in close contact with the commander.
He said, 'Get up.'
I got up.
Then a soldier said, 'There are still publications in progress.'
'There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus,' he said.
I said, 'They're broadcasting from Cyprus, we can't do anything to them.'
"Then after we wrote to someone, he got us all up and walked away".
The coup plotters fled Turksat in a minibus.
I saw the photos of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water being executed in the back seat of that van.
They shot him three times in the forehead and cheeks.
My friends confirmed it was the same soldier.
They called that soldier "son" when we were there.
Probably a soldier who's been doing his military service.
They may have executed him to get rid of him.
According to Asim Akkaya, the first police team came to TurkSat from Gölbaşı.
When the police teams found out that there were helicopters in the area, that security guards were searching, they went back to the precinct to get ammunition.
They came back 40 minutes later.
When the police teams arrived, they didn't see anyone in the Turk's foreign policy.
Akkaya said that after only 3-4 minutes of the police, the so-called experts sent from Samanyolu TV came to the building.
"When the police asked for ID, they all four of them got on their phones and called in and said 'caught'", he said.
The spirit of the mountain after the closure
AK Party will take a large delegation including businessmen, artists, sportsmen and leaders of the faith to Diyarbakir, Van and Mardin in early September to build "heart bridges" with citizens in the region.
AK Party is preparing to move the "Enikapı spirit" of democracy to Diyarbakır after the bloody coup attempt of the FETÖ/PDY junta.
The provincial governors of CHP and MHP will be invited to the relief campaign in the Eastern and Southeastern regions of Anatolia before the Eid al-Adha.
AK Party, which will give the message to the people of the region "The state and the nation are with you", will reach out to poor families and those in need.
The AK Party's last MYK meeting discussed the Gönül Bridge Project, which was implemented for the first time in Ramadan.
The positive results of the project for families affected by terrorism in the region, especially young people and children, were evaluated at the meeting.
The work started under the chairmanship of the Vice President, Civil Society and Public Relations Chairman Mehmet Muezzinoğlu.
Accordingly, 12 provinces in the East and Southeast will be gathered in Diyarbakir, Mardin and Van.
The three provinces that the center has approved will hold meetings before the holiday.
Businessmen, artists, athletes and community leaders will also participate.
These meetings will discuss the organization of aid and work.
On the occasion of the holiday, delegations of famous names will personally deliver the aid to the citizens.
The youth and children will be given holiday allowance, and the school needs will be met as schools will be opened after the holidays.
The sacrifice meat will be distributed to those in need.
The atmosphere of national unity that was formed after the coup between the AK Party, CHP and MHP after July 15 will also be reflected in this project.
The CHP and MHP provincial leaders of 12 countries will be invited to participate in the project.
The three parties will be able to work together to carry out the relief activities.
It is being considered that the HDP will not be invited to the events as in Yenikapı.
The father-in-law of the "Just Orphan" spoke
The FETÖ member, who was shown to be the number one in the July 15 coup attempt, was taken into custody along with his mother-in-law and father-in-law.
Father-in-law Cevat Yildirim and mother-in-law Hatice Yildirim were released by the court on the condition of judicial control and a ban on their departure.
Speaking at the court appearance, Cevat Yıldırım called on his son-in-law to surrender and said: "I am with the state".
God damn the coup plotters.
I know, I've known the Fair Orphan for 18 years, I didn't really recognize him.
I don't have a son-in-law called Fair Orphan.
I want him caught as soon as possible.
He can't live in Turkey or the world like this.
Let him come, trust in Turkish justice.
If he's made a mistake, he'll pay.
He's been giving us a hard time running away.
Woe to the police, woe to the state.
The police have been on the job for 20-25 days.
Yıldırım said that he did not want Turkey to return to Syria.
We don't want Turkey to go and become like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
He has a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"What's the use of our blow?"
On the other hand, the last time he was seen passing through the TEM motorway in Akyazı around 03.00 on July 19, he was missing after leaving his 'SIR' license plate in Akyazı in the garage of his father-in-law's house.
FETÖ operation at university: 30 detained

In the operation carried out by the Directorate of the Financial Crimes Fighting Branch at Katip Çelebi University in Izmir, 30 of the 40 suspects were detained at their addresses.
Among the names detained in the operation carried out by the instructions of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Izmir are professors.
The names of the detainees were questioned at the Directorate of the Financial Crimes Combat Branch.
We're still working on the other names.
The prosecutor who was arrested tried to commit suicide
According to the information received, the teams of the District Security Directorate wanted to detain the Republican Prosecutor of Viranshehir Ahmet Fişne in his office within the scope of the investigation.
Fišne then claimed that he would commit suicide by pointing his gun at his head.
Fishne was persuaded by his coworkers and his wife, who came to the court, to stop committing suicide.
Fişne was taken to the District Police Department.
Smoking bans in parks and sports grounds
The Mayor of Bilecik, Selim Yağcı, said that the decision of the City Council to add an article to the regulation on smoking in parks, sports and playgrounds was made at the signing ceremony held at the Sheikh Edebali Culture and Congress Center.
Yağcı recalled that they met with all public institution managers concerned about the future of new generations in order to sign a protocol, wishing the protocol to be better for children and youth.
The provincial health director Yasin Yilmaz also said that the protocol aims to make people quit smoking and to distance young people from bad habits.

He saw the compass at Ergenekon, killed FETO
Ankara's Republic Prosecutor's Office is investigating FETÖ's role in the mysterious death of Behçet Oktay, the head of the Special Operations Department whose case was closed in 2009 for "suicide".
The former head of the Security Intelligence Department, Ramazan Akyürek, who was in the same room as Oktay and who had been listening to Oktay under a false name as a suspect in the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization six days before his death, is the main suspect in the investigation.
It is alleged that some of the ammunition seized in the framework of the Ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried by the FETÖ team in the security from the Special Operations Department, which Oktay was killed because he detected.
The death of Behçet Oktay, then head of the Special Operations Department, was described as "suicide" in Ankara on February 25, 2009.
But there were many question marks.
After a legal battle with his family and family lawyers and the evidence he presented, a murder investigation was opened two years later.
Oktay, who was left-handed, had the gun in his right hand that he was said to have shot himself with.
Also found fractures to the ribs and bruising on the body.
The murder investigation was opened in May 2012.
The only person tried in the murder case was Khalil Keshi, who was with him when he died and had gunshot residue on him.
He was acquitted at the end of the harsh trial.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor saying he was involved in Oktay's death, was sentenced to 6 months in prison on charges of "assuming responsibility and misleading the judicial authorities".
The voters should be questioned.
Meanwhile, prosecutor Hüseyin Yalçın, who called the incident "suicide", retired and promoted Mustafa Düzgün, who was conducting the murder investigation, to the Supreme Court.
Oktay's family wants the autopsy prosecutor Nihat Yildirim to be investigated along with these prosecutors.
Behcet Oktay's sister Shule Oktay and brother Nezih Oktay and family lawyers made many demands during the trial.
The family has asked for an extension of the investigation, saying it is impossible that Khalil cutter killed Oktay, a specially trained, alone.
The family said the incident was covered up, and prosecutors asked for the identification and trial of the security officers who wanted to close the case of Hüseyin Yalçın and Mustafa Dügün and Behçet Oktay as suicides.
While all the family's demands were denied, it turned out that Oktay was interrogated under the false name "Abdurrahman Doğru" as a member of the Hezbollah Terror Organization six days before his death.
The person who conducted the hearing was identified as Ramazan Akyürek, the then head of the Security Intelligence Department.
The Ankara Republic Prosecutor's Office, which reviewed the Behçet Oktay case, began investigating the FETÖ's involvement in the murder.
The trial in Ankara's High Court of Justice on the illegal interrogation of Oktay will begin on September 19.
There 's a TABEI KI FETO behind it
The family of Oktay, whom SABAH interviewed, is hopeful about the ongoing investigation.
Family members say FETÖ's finger in the murder was covered up during the previous show-stopping investigation and trial.
Sister Shule Oktay said, "This murder actually came to the scene".
We didn't get it.
My brother said before he was killed, 'They're gonna eat me.'
I said, 'Who?'
That's when he pointed the FETO at me.
I thought he was being discharged.
I never thought about death.
FETO is behind this, of course.
"They were the ones who had the power back then", he said.
The martyr called the young man's family, joined in the prayer
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after addressing citizens in the Presidential Palace garden during the last shift of the previous evening, called the family of democracy martyr university student Ömer Can Açıkgöz through AK Party Sinop MP Nazım Mavis.
Father Fahrettin Açıkgöz said that the phone came while they were praying for their son at 01.30 am.
"I told him that our country and his health were important to us".
'Your Health Is Important to Us'
President Erdogan addressed the citizens in front of the Presidential Palace the previous evening.
Erdogan met with some citizens in Kulliye after his speech, which ended at midnight.
Taking the hand of an elderly aunt who had come to watch over democracy, Tayyip Erdogan walked with the citizens, talked to them one by one, took care of the children, and thanked the citizens for their sacrifices.
Erdogan then called Fahrettin Akıkgöz, the father of the 15 July martyr Ömer Can Akıkgöz, through AK Party Sinop MP Nazım Mavis.
Fahrettin Açıkgöz, the father of 21-year-old Ömer Can, a student of the Law Faculty of TOBB University who was shot in front of the Presidency Palace, said that President Erdogan called him at 01.30 when he was praying for his son and the martyrs at home.
I told him that our country and his health were very important to us.
"We are very pleased that our President called and prayed on the phone", she said.
FETO's pyramid is destroyed
26 FETÖ members were arrested in Urla, Izmir.
Among those arrested is Kurtuluş Naip Hepyalçın, who according to the victims' statements, was called a "mutagallibe" in the organization and threatened those who wanted to end his subscription to the newspaper.
20 sisters of FETÖ were arrested in Uşak.
In Bursa, 24 people, including Ali Osman Kahya, the former Bursa Police Director, were sent to court.
Doctor Imami is arrested
In Edirne, the imam responsible for the doctors of the organization, Aydın Tünbel, was arrested.
14 professors were detained at Denizli Pamukkale University, 30 at Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University, 19 at Karabük University, 2 academics at Rize, and FETÖ colonel Hilmi Sandal was detained.
In Diyarbakir, 8 judges and prosecutors and 2 deputy governors, 2 kaymakam were detained.
It turns out that one of the judges was arrested in the courtroom.
In Batman, the deputy governor, Shener Chaglar, was fired.
Two police chiefs were arrested out of 465 police who were dismissed from Istanbul Police.
In Konya, 51 and Kayseri, 14, Malatya, 14, Siirt, 10 police and the provincial imam Naim S. were arrested in Adana.
He was protecting the treacherous PKK who shot the people.
Turkey, which has been waging a relentless fight to end PKK terror for over forty years, is beginning to see why it has not been able to destroy the leaders of the organization in this struggle.
FETÖ militants infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions and worked from all sides to tie Turkey's hand to its arm.
At the point we are today, serious doubts and evidence are beginning to emerge that FETO is behind critical events like the Hrant Dink murder, Uludere incident, the downing of the Russian plane.
The traitor 's story is too big
It turned out that the record of FETÖ Brigadier General Gökhan Şahin Sönmezateş, who led the raid and assassination operation on President Tayyip Erdogan's hotel in Marmaris during the July 15 coup attempt, was quite bulky.
Earlier, it was determined that Sönmezateş informed the terrorists of the air operations to be carried out against the PKK while the planes were taking off.
The investigation by the intelligence units also found that Gökhan Sönmezateş's record was bulging.
He protected terrorists.
In addition to leaking intelligence to the PKK, it was also revealed that Turkish warplanes did not hit their targets exactly.
The MIT's point of reference on the leadership of the PKK was that intelligence was misdirected by Gökhan Sönmezateş and prevented the targeting.
With the change of coordinates, it was determined that the warplanes that were flown to destroy the PKK's leadership had hit the targets' flanks, thus saving the leaders of the terrorist organization.
The intelligence investigation revealed that Sönmezateş played a key role in both diverting targets and preventing PKK terrorists from flying F-16s.
37 thousand officers are being opened
After the coup attempt of FETÖ members was foiled by the terrorist leader Fethullah Gülen, the process of reconstruction was started in the TSK and the Ministry of National Defense.
Especially when it was discovered that the entrance questions to military high schools were stolen by FETÖ, and that military students who were not members of the organization were being intimidated and sent out of schools, a comprehensive cleanup process was started.
With the latest expulsions, there are about 37,000 officers left out of 39,287 officers, while the cleanup for generals and admirals will be done for these officers as well.
For this, promotion will be frozen, especially in ranks from lieutenant to colonel.
A full investigation will be completed before your promotion.
The files of 37,000 officers are being opened one by one.
A thorough investigation will reveal the FETO soldiers.
Officers who have no connection to FETO will continue in their duties.
The fight will continue until the last FETÖ member is cleared from the army, while the promotion of officers will only come up after the investigation.
The investigation is being conducted jointly by the MIT, the Security Intelligence and the State Control Board.
The investigation is looking into whether the officers who opened the file were civilians or military graduates, their rank and promotions, their places of duty and commanders.
And even their arrangements will be investigated by a hair-raising study to see if they are FETO members.
Every measure will be taken to ensure that officers who have no connection with FETO are not adversely affected by the process.
If there is any doubt, that officer will be immediately discharged and brought to justice.
Anyone identified as having ties to FETÖ, anyone with information and documents about them will be immediately cut off from the army.
While all these processes are frozen, the investigation will be deepened.
The necessary measures will be taken to ensure that there are no vacancies in the post-export staff.
Those who were expelled from the TSK with FETÖ's cover and those who were forced to retire will be able to return to their profession with the same rights as their colleagues after passing the security investigation if they wish.
Two thousand 133 sub-subs were exported
The Chief of General Staff announced the number of TSK personnel on July 1 as 39,287 officers.
Of the 32,289 personnel in the officer class, consisting of lieutenant, lieutenant, captain, major, colonel and colonel, the majority served in the Army, Air Force and Navy.
However, in the first wave of exports on July 27, 99 officers were discharged, including 726 in the Army, 314 in the Air Force, and 59 in the Navy.
In the July 31 decree, another 1,304 officers were cut off from TSK, including 125 from Kara and 909 from the General Command of the Gendarmerie.
Pehlivanoğlu: FETÖ poisoned the Turkesh
The head of the MHP, Tahsin Pehlivanoğlu, who retired from the guards of Alparslan Türkeş, the founder and first general chairman of the MHP, suggested that Türkeş was poisoned and killed by a family member in cooperation with FETÖ.
Pehlivanoğlu, who was with Turkesh from 1977 until his death in 1997, said, "I have not told anyone until today, but I was forced to speak after watching the image of that soldier who tore parts of Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu's helicopter and saw that the same soldier was in the coup plotters who were sent to kill our President".
This is what Turkesh's security guard said:
We went to Germany in 1997.
We had the head of the family checked out three days before he came.
The 33-year-old Burdurlu doctor who checked up on her, Fikret, said, "You look like an 18-year-old".
He said, "You're fine".
This doctor died of a heart attack a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3.
My cold went to Amasya.
They called me on the way back and went to a target in the Ankara Hilton.
After he gets out of the target, he says to the Turk driver, Alparslan, "Open the rear window".
He wouldn't open a window.
When I open the window, I hear a bang.
First they gave me a heart massage, electrocuting at the Chankaia Medical Center, but it was over.
We all took him to the medical center, but it was a bust.
I think someone in the family poisoned him in Amasya.
Turkesh was not autopsied.
His ex-wife Seval Turkesh, who must have heard my discomfort and my remarks, came out and made defensive statements like "Turkesh was killed" and so on.
Man makes the grave of the defeated, and he makes the grave of the unconquered.
They said a heart attack.
Turkesh's grave must be reopened.
Alparslan Turkesh was killed?
They were caught smuggling gold into Pennsylvania!
In the operation to organize businessmen of FETÖ/PDY in Izmir, a 1,5 kg piece of hash was seized during its shipment to Pennsylvania.
In the course of the operation, a search of his workplace revealed that he had found 30 kilos of gold waiting to be smuggled into Pennsylvania.
Three people who were arrested after the gold was being prepared to be sent to Pennsylvania were sent to prison.
In addition, businessmen Mustafa Özkara, Ezel Seçilmiş and Resul Seçilmiş were arrested in the operation conducted in Izmir.

Tic Ltd. Ltd. (BALPET) Ezel Selected and Resul Selected were detained.
It was determined that Özkara, who was arrested at the Adnan Menderes Airport in Izmir while trying to flee to Kyrgyzstan, was the son of Osman Gürbüz Özkara, who was part of the first delegation of Fethullah Gülen's trustees, and was one of the most important names of FETÖ in the Aegean Region.
The other businessmen, Ezel and Resul Seçilmiş, who were arrested for allegedly providing funds to FETÖ, were also informed that five gas stations belonging to them were seized.
They stole a car and robbed three gas stations in an hour.
It happened last night in Eagle.
The two suspects who came to Kartal with the vehicle they seized first robbed a petrol station on the side road, then another petrol station 300 meters away, then another petrol station on the side road with a gun.
The police of the Eagle, who were alerted after the robberies, quickly identified the suspects and began the arrest.
Police teams have been tracking the vehicle used by the suspects, C.C. and U.A.
The suspects started to flee from their vehicle in the direction of Eagle Square, and shot at the police.
One of the suspects was caught in a curve on Sovereignty Boulevard after a chase on foot.
Police quickly arrested the second suspect based on information from the C.S.
The suspects were arrested and sent to prison after their actions in the Eagle Order Bureau.
On the other hand, the masked robbery was caught on camera.
In the video footage from the gas station security cameras, the suspect first entered the gas station, then entered the supermarket, wearing masks and carrying weapons in a vehicle outside.
The first suspect to enter the store and the store clerk are engaged in a fight.
The suspect who walked out of the store with the employee attacked, then the other person with him walks in with a mask and a gun to his head.
After disabling the suspected employee who pulled the gun, he escapes with the 6,200 lire in the safe.
The suspects seized about 15 thousand lira, an unlicensed weapon and a vehicle from three stations.
Earthquake of magnitude 7.2 in the Great Ocean
The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the quake was recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers on the seabed 109 kilometers east of its headquarters on New Caledonia Island.
The tsunami warning was canceled shortly after the earthquake, which caused no loss of life and property.
Vanuatu, which is located in the "Pacific Ring of Fire" earthquake belt, is frequently hit by earthquakes.
He prayed for martyrdom unaware of the blow.
The family of Çetin Can, 38, who was martyred on the Boğaziçi Bridge on the night of July 15, is protecting his endurance.
His wife Fatma Jan said that she learned the "martyrdom prayer in the month of Shawwal" in a conversation when she was not aware of the coup attempt that night, and then she prayed the martyrdom prayer at home, and recommended that she pray it herself.
Fatma Jan, who said they watched the evening news on television and learned about the coup attempt, said:
We got ready and went out together.
When we went to the bridge, there were people waiting there.
As soon as we entered the bridge, the tank fired two shots at us.
We took the trench, then we kept walking when the tank left.
There was a big bus stop on the bridge.
It was so crowded.
We stood there for a while, waiting.
When we couldn't move forward, we thought, what do we do?
He wanted us to take the hard side.
I'm guessing it was a sniper when he crossed the side lane, we were a clear target, and he was shot there.
Four hours after he prayed that hard prayer, he prayed and died.
He didn't know about the coup.
A wisdom of Allah...
Allah is the giver and the taker.
My wife said, "If I die, plant a tree that will bear fruit on my grave".
I fulfilled his wish by planting a pear tree on his grave.
Fatma Jan thanked President Erdogan for visiting them and said, "God bless him".

The sky will be the scene of meteor showers
Doç. Dr. Hasan Esenoğlu, researcher at the TÜBİTAK National Observatory and faculty member of the Department of Astronomy and Space Sciences at Istanbul University, told the Associated Press that Perseid will reach its highest level on the night of Friday, August 12th, and Saturday, August 13th.
Esenoğlu said that thousands of pieces of rock were separated from the comet Swift-Tuttle by the sun and gravity, and formed the Perseid meteor shower.
Esenoğlu said that the Perseid celestial body was first discovered in 1862, and since the 1990s, it has been seen again in the world.
Esenoğlu said that the Perseid meteor shower can be seen in July and August, "We need to watch and take care of this visual feast from space".
After all, it's a natural visual feast.
"It will help us to understand the universe better", he said.
They'll glow red when they're cold, white when they're hot
Esenoğlu pointed out that some of the pieces of debris that fell during the hailstones will fall to the ground.
Perseid temperatures can reach 2,000 degrees.
Because of the heating and friction in the atmosphere, the Perseids emit red light when they're cold in the natural environment and white when they're hot.
You can contribute to science by writing down how many meteors you see on the International Meteorological Organization's website.
This data is valuable because it's collected from all over the world.
It'll be on all night.
He said the rain of stones is moving at a speed of about 60 kilometers per second and can be seen throughout the night from the northeast.
Esenoğlu said that more than 100 rain of meteorites occur in a year, and after the Perseid rain of meteorites, the Geminid rain of meteorites on December 4-17 was a natural phenomenon worth watching.
Erdoğan, former footballer with little education
If that balance was upset, it was the winning alliance of populist Islamists led by undereducated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Fethullah Gülen's highly educated followers, a largely religious entrepreneur, who built more than a thousand schools, dozens of universities and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent.
The above is a translation of an article in Foreign Policy last week.
The Western press often publishes articles about Erdoğan, a low-educated former football player who graduated from university, and Gülen, a former elementary school graduate who is described as a broad-minded entrepreneur, and openly praises Gülen's followers.
And then on the other hand, in their articles on "Why is anti-Americanism and/or anti-Westernism rising in Turkey?" they try to explain with phrases that start with "Because Erdogan"...
It is possible to think that analysts who see anti-Western sentiment in Turkey as a phenomenon that emerged during the Erdogan era are ignorant of Turkey's history.
In fact, statistically, the first decade of the Erdogan era can be read as a period when anti-Western sentiment in Turkey declined or remained average.
Because during that decade, he had good synchronous relations with the European Union and the United States.
Erdogan's one-minute criticism of Israel, the EU's failure to formulate a clear policy on the outbreak of civil war in Syria as a result of the massacres of the Assad regime and leaving Turkey alone in the refugee crisis, the rebellious attitudes of some figures such as European Parliament President Schulz, who said "Erdogan is not our interlocutor", the opening of a curse-competition against Erdogan in Britain and the then Mayor of London, including the Foreign Minister, who even won with a poem in which he made the most disgusting statements you can not imagine alone, the PKK's live bombs that entered the country from Turkey are causing a lot of pressure on our citizens since then, the PKK's YPG in Syria should not be allowed to operate in Europe and the YPG should be allowed to leave the capital and the number of troops in Turkey should be reduced, and the US special forces, such as the representatives of the YPG, should be in charge of the fight against the terrorist group, and the United States should be in charge of the fight against the terrorist group.
Let's just say that while we lost 247 of our people in a bloody coup, we forgot that there was no support for our democracy from our so-called allies, the EU countries and the US, until the coup failed to be proven, that they expected Kerry to build peace and stability in Turkey in his first speech on the subject, that they made no emphasis on democracy and elected government.
How can we forget that many leaders from around the world, including Turkey, have joined the protest march for the murder of 11 Charlie Hebdo employees in Paris, but that not a single president from any Western country, which is an ally of Turkey, has visited Turkey even after a month since the coup attempt in which 247 people who resisted the tanks for democracy were killed?
What about presidents who come here a few times a year to discuss the refugee issue or send high-level representatives to send low-level representatives?
How can we assess that all EU and US ambassadors are not going to the bombed Turkish Grand National Assembly to show solidarity?
If we remember that in the first two weeks after the coup in Egypt, the EU sent a high-level representative to shake hands with the coup leader Sisi, and Kerry praised the coup regime during his post-coup visit saying 'democracy is being rebuilt', is it too abnormal that Western countries that refuse to support Turkey in the democratic resistance do not express their concern about Turkish democracy at every opportunity in Turkey?
Yet the fact that Gulen, who 95% of the population holds responsible for the coup, is allowed to live freely in the United States is enough to anger the Turkish people.
Add to that the background I've listed above, and I think it's clear that the rising Western/American antagonism is not something that can be explained by Erdogan alone.
And Erdogan hasn't even said yet that he thinks the US had a hand in the coup...
So the box was never a condo.
Can the Gezi intellectuals who disdain their own people, who say "the box is a teferruat", who insult voters who don't think like them as "ignorants who scratch their stomachs", play the same game after the night of July 15?
After seeing how these people have got the state and democracy, have they looked for answers to the question, "Where did we go wrong?"
But there are so many questions to be answered?
How did officers who had served in various ranks and were given the right to use state weapons suddenly accept the status of "traitor" and seek asylum in foreign countries?
We need to see how we live in a mentally distorted environment and how obsessions with people lead people to what would be called deviant behavior.
As for the brainwashed coup attempt...
Did the participants have any other perspective than to compare the cities of Turkey to the cities of Syria?
Why would an officer bomb his own country's parliament?
We probably shouldn't have made the mistake of expecting reasonable behavior from brains watered down by the bedsheets of FETÖ.
But let's just know that FETO is not the only one responsible.
Those who have made politics a profession of strife, hatred and hatred have also contributed to the tragedy.
The self-proclaimed "Enlightened" lunatics have convinced the masses that all forms of disorderly behavior and even indecency are natural.
We've even seen how they shoot this ring when they put guns in the hands of people who hate their own people.
The way of democracy, the way we know
I'll say something very simple: on the evening of July 15th, the people of Turkey gave 250 martyrs to the FETÖ Tufeylites, Haramites, Sergerds in the army and built more than save democracy.
But there are three periods behind July 15th: 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and after.
There are three changes that have been prepared in these three periods: economic, social, political.
Social change has been shaped by two major phenomena: migration from rural areas to metropolitan areas and the movement of these migrants to the centre after being confined around cities for too long.
On Wednesday, I mentioned that the transfer was by subway.
I also stressed that the most important factor in social change is whether or not to go by metro.
The second big change along the same line is bridges and roads.
The contribution of the road and the bridge to modernisation is easier to understand.
The way income is changed, the economic and social structure.
And it's changed our political structure just as much.
I've traced this date to bridges over the Bosphorus in Istanbul.
Demirel built the Gorge Bridge.
This was the peak of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
Özal continued to move in the same direction with the second bridge, which we have now renamed the 15 July Martyrs Bridge.
Even the routes of these show the relationship between the environment and the center.
It's a sign of what kind of social change course is being followed.
Demirel and Ozal's goal was to melt the masses downtown.
It was to adopt the ideology of the Centre.
The AK Party hasn't built the third bridge in years.
Because the migration was going full speed.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
A somewhat closed system has been created in those areas.
Local governments with the AK Party gave people food, jobs, social status, and they voted for the AK Party.
So the masses were asked not to melt down in the center, but to acquire their political consciousness in the surroundings and come to the center afterwards 'as themselves'.
This formation was related to the continuing headscarf debates (1992-2002) before the AK Party.
These debates made the masses accept the necessity of the conservative, the moderate and the rural people to stand side by side, not to integrate with the center.
The AK Party, acting in the manner I mentioned after 2002, politicized the masses, joined politics, matured them.
After that, now notice, the democratic struggle on July 15 coincides with the construction of the 3rd bridge.
So, history and sociology overlap.
Let me add another dimension: the move of the AK Party, which I mentioned, is not limited to Istanbul bridges.
Something more interesting is happening: the AK Party is now integrating the surrounding cities into the central cities.
And that's provided by two bridges.
One, the Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, the 1915 bridge to Çanakkale.
Add the roads to this.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Thrace by another route.
You know what that meant, Izmir will be a completely different city from now on.
Let's say that the AK Party will take Izmir from the outside, which it could not take from the inside.
Now Bursa, now Çanakkale, now the cities of Thrace will become different human and social geographies.
That's it!
The 15th of July martyrs are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie and cheerful sports in Fenerbahçe
Fenerbahçe continued preparations for the Grasshoppers game with morning practice.
The training, which started at 10 a.m. and was led by technical director Vitor Pereira, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After the core training, which lasted 30 minutes, the players went out to the field and did 2 ball catches and passes for 5 with running and warm-up movements.
Training was completed with double-header matches on a narrow field.
Fenerbahçe will continue their preparations with a practice this evening.
The person who complained about Saint Yıldırım to Gülen...
There are new developments in the operation Shike against Fenerbahçe.
"A name from the sports world brought Aziz Yildirim's words about himself to Fethullah Gülen", said journalist Hüseyin Güler, who participated in a program broadcast on CNN Türk and explained that this operation was carried out by FETÖ.
"One day in the plane, Lightning said to this person, 'What are you doing with Fethullah Gülen?'"
When this person told Gülen these words, Fethullah Gülen also spoke to Aziz Yıldırım.
Why did he put it on Saint Lightning?
The president of Turkey's biggest fan club thinks he can hurt himself if he's in this state of mind.
He used the phrase "the case of Shike was to liquidate Aziz Yildirim".
After these words, a statement came from Faik Işık, one of the important lawyers of the Shike case.
He appeared on the program "Contrasto" in the Turkish newspaper "Işık Habertürk" and revealed the person who complained about Aziz Yıldırım to FETÖ chief Fethullah Gülen.
Here are the words of Faik Işık:
Aziz Yildirim is telling something to Ihsan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gülen.
On the way back from Azerbaijan, on a private plane.
Mr. Aziz is a man of humour, and when he criticizes someone, he speaks in a sinister way.
Those sinking sentences might just bleed a little.
Some people might react to those sentences.
These sentences are being grown somewhere.
Towels, goods, all these businessmen going there as if they were going to Hajj, Umrah, it's not something that's tolerated.
They're very critical of what they do.
That's not the only problem, of course.
And by the way, they have a football team.
Direct connections of some players and managers from Galatasaray Club and Hakan Shukur...
Muharrem Usta: The subject of the shike is different
Trabzonspor President Muharrem Usta extended a hand of friendship to Fenerbahce.
"We are on the side of this country with 79 million", Usta said, saying that Turkey's issue is the issue of all clubs.
We need to take a healthy approach.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FETO, if it was unfair, I will stand behind Fenerbahçe.
"But the issue between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahce is different".
The price of the sacrifice has been announced.
"We have collectively set the price of a kilogram of live bull for sacrifice at 18 pounds", said Karabulut.
"We have determined the price of the live kilogram of the cow, which we define as second class, at 17 lira, and the price of the live kilogram of the cow, which we define as second class, at 15 lira", he said.
Noting that animals that were not intended to be sacrificed were also sold last year, Karabulut told what citizens should be careful about when buying sacrifices:
In animals, the earpiece is especially important.
It's also important that the animal is healthy.
So that our citizens can check the vaccines in the animal's passport when they take the victim.
And from the looks of it, the victim must be alive and kicking, having dropped his feathers on it.
And you shouldn't have any signs of drooling or drooling on your face.
In recent years, we've seen non-victim animals being offered and sold.
A sacrificial animal must be at least two years old.
And we can tell that by looking at the animal's teeth.
An animal that's two years old has what we call a "cap" in its teeth.
But the younger animals don't have these teeth.
The animal may look large in appearance, but the canines may not have come out.
And the canines are already bigger than the others, so you can tell.
Rize Airport will be built on the sea
Rize Airport will be the second airport to be built in Turkey with sea fill.
Rize Airport will be built on a 266-hectare area between the village of Yeşilköy and the location of Kız Kulesi in Pazar district, on a sea wall 26 to 32 meters from the coast.
Due to the depth of the Rize airport, about three times more filling material will be used than at the Ardu-Giresun Airport.
The project will build a runway 45 meters wide and 3,000 meters long with a apron that can accommodate 36 planes per hour.
Rize Airport, which will generally serve passenger and cargo aircraft, is also expected to serve aircraft with a class D composition, turbulence class heavy, takeoff weight of more than 150 thousand kilograms.
Rize Airport project, which will be tendered by the General Directorate of Infrastructure Investments of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications on September 8, will be built in the first phase with sea filling, runway, apron, taxiway, bypass, safety wire mesh, fences, PAT fields and environmental lighting.
These works will cost 600 million lire.
After the infrastructure works, the upper structure will be built, including the terminal buildings, with a cost of 150 million liras.
Rize Airport will be completed in two years and nine months.
Eight cents more on your bike.
Fuel distribution companies have increased the average price of your engine by eight cents a liter, effective midnight.
According to information from the Petrol Products Employers' Union (PÜİS), from August 13, 2016, the price of the engine will increase by an average of 8 cents per liter.
Accordingly, the price of the engine in Ankara, which is 3.68 liters per liter, will rise to 3.76 liters.
The price of the engine will rise from an average of 3.63 liras in Istanbul to 3.71 liras, and in Izmir from an average of 3.66 liras to 3.74 liras.
The prices set by the distribution companies can vary slightly from company to company and city to city due to competition and freedom.
Fuel distribution companies raised the price of their engines by 4 cents a liter last Friday.
These are the Galatasaray footballers in Gülen's conversation.
It turned out that Galatasaray and national footballers, who once left their mark on Turkish football, were involved in the conversation of FETÖ head Fethullah Gülen in 1996.
The video, which was said to have been taken in 1996, shows Hakan Ünsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, Ismail Demiriz, Uğur Tütüneker and Yusuf Tepekule clearly among the players listening to Fethullah Gülen's conversation.
In the conversation, Gülen used the phrase "4 goals we scored and we won" referring to Galatasaray.
Said Alpsoy, who is known as the former football imam of FETÖ, recently told the newspaper SABAH: "When Turkey became the third in the World in 2002, the team was given a bonus".
Emre, Okan, Hakan Shukur, Hakan Ünsal and Arif collected money from these bonuses.
The money raised was $250,000 or $500,000.
Arif Erdem took this money to Pennsylvania.
"Gulen then praised Arif", he explained.
The national football team has joined Gulen's conversation!

What a striking statement about FETÖ from Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, an official at the law firm Amsterdam&Partners, which legally investigates the international illegal activities of the FETÖ, wrote an article for the US magazine Forbes, sharing information about how FETÖ was organized.
Amsterdam said that FETÖ leader Fethullah Gülen ran the organization from his mansion in Pennsylvania, and that "if you look closely at how Gülen runs about 150 charter schools in the United States, it will be clear that the organization has a secret advanced organizational ability underground".
Amsterdam said that seven months ago Turkey had been tasked with investigating companies and schools linked to Gülen, and that what they had found so far was "shocking".
In its article, Amsterdam expressed the following views:
According to the information we've been given by the whistleblowers, the Gülen organization has a strict hierarchy in which instructions are conveyed.
These instructions are usually passed on in face-to-face meetings with Gülen in the Poconos.
At the top, there's a seven-person management team.
This group passes on instructions to the advisory committee.
The instructions go from here to the regional imams, the country imams, the regional imams within the country, the provincial imams, the regional imams within the provinces, the neighborhood imams, the imams of the student houses (light houses) and the students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats, and officers work at different levels according to their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam, which claims to create 55,000 jobs worldwide and to have the largest network of charter schools in the United States, reported that millions of dollars in American taxpayer dollars are given to these schools each year.
Amsterdam wrote that most of this money was channelled among the organization's members and transferred to "selected" companies abroad.
Amsterdam illustrated this process with the following examples:
Magnolia Schools, based in California, was caught paying $700,000 a year in service contracts to a company affiliated with Gülen and sharing the same office.
Amsterdam gave another example, the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam also noted that the school paid an additional $3.1 million to the property owner, and that the audits found that the school and the management of the property owner company were made up of the same people connected to Gülen.
Amsterdam, which has 46 branches and is the largest in the Gülen network, has similar situations, and said that smaller companies connected to FETÖ are paid with pens for software licenses, curriculum acquisition.
Amsterdam, underlining that the FETÖ is mutually enriching, said, "These examples I gave show that approximately 28 million dollars of American taxpayers' money was misused".
"And that's just the visible part of what we've found so far", he said.
Noting that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents, Amsterdam said the situation has worsened in the past few days, and that the Texas Department of Education is investigating the irregularities.
Amsterdam stressed that schools seem to be functioning normally, with many employees unaware of what kind of corruption is involved.
Amsterdam, "But really these schools work like snow machines for Gülen".
"Gulen then uses his huge sum of money for political donations in order to hide his illegal activities", he assessed.
According to a former American teacher who worked in these schools, Amsterdam said that some employees of Gülen schools held meetings separately, transferring a certain part of their salaries to the organization.
The coup plotters had been strengthening their position over the years.
"But it seems that while the army was functioning normally, a parallel force was gathering strength behind the scenes", he wrote.
Amsterdam concluded his article:
There are questions in the minds of policymakers in the United States about the events of July 15-16 and beyond, and that's to be expected.
But while the two allies are dealing with their situation at the diplomatic level, individual officials need to wake up to the fact that Gulen's operations are in serious violation of U.S. law.
22 judges are on the run in Istanbul!

Zacharias Öz from Çavuşoğlu
"At the moment, this information is not true", Cavusoglu said.
But there are different reports.
All of this is being evaluated.
We're in close contact with the Georgian authorities.
"Every detail, information, report is being carefully evaluated", he said.
Asked if he had any doubts that they might be in Georgia, Çavuşoğlu said: "Zekeriya Öz had fled to Georgia before".
It was picked up on the security cameras at the customs gate.
He knows he's been to Europe.
We're reviewing and tracking every information we can get, not just for these two, but for the other escapees.
Wherever they run, we will track them".
Asked about his meeting with his Iranian counterpart, Cevad Zarif, Cavusoglu said: "Two issues were assessed".
There are many issues between Turkey and Iran.
Politics, trade, transportation, energy, the fight against terrorism are our common struggle.
There are regional issues.
Syria, Iraq, Yemen, the Gulf region, including Syria.
Turkey and Iran can play an important role in solving the problems in our geography.
We have a lot in common.
We agree on many issues, including the territorial integrity of Syria, the integrity of the borders and the cleansing of Syria of ISIS and other terrorist organizations, and having an inclusive government.
We had different opinions about Assad.
But we're gonna keep talking about this like we always do.
We agree on ceasefire, on continuing the Geneva negotiations.
Consensus on many issues is meaningless unless it basically results.
He said, "The important thing is to get results".
When asked when Turkish planes will participate in operations in Syria, Cavusoglu said: "Our delegation went to Moscow about this".
"The purpose of setting up these mechanisms is to determine what steps are taken in the fight against ISIS here and to coordinate any incident to prevent an accident", he said.
To the question about gas purchases with Iran, Çavuşoğlu said, "Iran and Turkey are two brotherly countries".
The arbitrators shouldn't decide, so we can make a deal between ourselves.
I had a little website.
We should be able to make these deals without going to trial.
"We have demands on gas discounts, prices".
Asked about the date of Gulen's return to the United States, Çavuşoğlu said, "A delegation from America will arrive on the 22nd".
The meetings will be held on August 23-24.
Our Justice Department is preparing the file.
Once the file is ready, it will be timed to coincide with the next visit from the United States.
"We're going to Washington with our Attorney General to deliver the files and meet with him".
A high-ranking PKK member was captured in Istanbul!

The Turkish people's taking to the streets has once again proved that the Turkish people and the will of the people are superior to all forces.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has condemned the coup attempt from the first hours of the coup attempt, as well as standing with the Turkish people and government and always has been.
My visit to the Turkish Grand National Assembly today is a symbol of our support for the Turkish people and Turkish democracy.
13 family members caught running away in a boat
Coastguard teams patrolling the Muslem Strait conducted an operation on a group of smugglers who were sailing in a boat in the early morning hours to flee to the Greek island of Midilli.
The identification of the 13 fugitives was made and it was determined that they belonged to the same family.

Saydo Ali Ahmet, who said they wanted to go to Greece and then Germany after paying 700 dollars each to the organizers, said they lived in the city of Shengal in Iraq and fled to Turkey because they were afraid of being killed by ISIS soldiers because they were Yazidi.
The migrant, who said he had family businesses in Iraq and spoke German, English, Spanish, Arabic and French, said his business had been disrupted by the arrival of ISIS in the region and his only desire was to go to his son in Germany.

And then he took me and put me in the trunk of the car with my friend.
My hand got caught between the trunk doors when I put it in the trunk.
I screamed.
The driver who heard me knocks the trunk door again.
I fixed my hand.
The trunk door closed again and took us to the village of Narince.

They took the kids, the injured, out of the trunk.
"He did what should not be done to an animal".
Osman O. the wounded man's uncle, said, "What kind of a citizen shot these children?"
It could be an accident, or a person could die in an accident.
But it's brutal to take the injured in the trunk of a car and take them to the hospital.
We're his followers to the end.
One of these kids is grappling with death.
The other one's in critical condition.
He's bringing the wounded in the trunk of his car from Narince to Kahta.
God damn it, you know.
I don't want this kind of savagery to happen again.
Our liver is burning.
We're gonna be the plaintiffs and we're not gonna back down.

The island, which is connected to the coast by a 100-foot cord, generates its own electricity, water, and Internet.
Sowa says, "I'm a vegetarian and I grow a lot of edible vegetables on the island".
I have to go to the nearby supermarkets to get some more food.
"And I have a swing for eight people, made of plastic bottles".

His father's assets were seized.
The Sakarya Republic Prosecutor's Office has issued a detention order against Hakan Shukur and his father Selmet Shukur, who was a contractor in Sakarya, as part of the FETÖ investigation.
The search was conducted in the homes of Hakan Shukur and his father Selmet Shukur in the United States and Adapazarı in Istanbul.
Selmet Shukur has not been found despite calls.
The police acted after Selmet Shukur was reported to be at Friday prayers at Salko Mosque in Adapazarı Sakarya Street.
The teams went to the mosque and waited for the Friday prayer to be said.
When the prayer was over, Selmet Shukur saw the police and raised his hands.
Selmet Şükür, who was ordered to be arrested, was taken to the Police Department.
Gökhan Şükür followed the team car where his father was taken to the police headquarters.
The Sakarya Republic Prosecutor's Office determined that Hakan Shukur and his father Selmet Shukur provided financial support to FETÖ.
The Nöbetçi Sulh Penal Court, which examined the prosecution's application, decided to seize the real estate, land transportation vehicles, bank or other financial institutions accounts, all rights and receivables of real or legal persons, valuable documents, shares in companies, rental vaults and other assets of Hakan Shukur and his father Selmet Shukur.
The court's decision was notified to the police, the police and the tax authorities within the day.
The first investigation of Hakan and Selmet Shukur was determined to be real estate rich.
It was found that Hakan Shukur and his father had apartments in Sakarya, Antalya, Bodrum, Istanbul Bakırköy, Beşiktaş, Büyükçekmece, a building in Adapazarı and Sapanca, land in Kandır.
It was determined that Selmet Shukur had built luxury villas on 10 acres of land in Sakarya's Serdivan district.
It was also determined that Hakan Shukur had a classroom in the center of Adapazarı, which was closed by the FETÖ investigation by the tax inspectors of the Finance Ministry Tax Control Board of the Sakarya Group Presidency.
The total assets of Hakan and his father Selmet Shukur are said to be worth around 200 million lira.
Fugitive police chief caught in Zaho

He was caught in a joint operation by the security forces of both countries.
Bitmez, brought to Turkey, was arrested in Batman.
He was immediately taken to court after his police procedure.
Security forces are suspicious that Bitmez fled to northern Iraq to join the PKK terrorist organization.
Watch out for this habit in kids
Dr. Bilgin Giray, of the Faculty of Dentistry, said that since children are unable to chew at an early age, they relax with this reflex by making sucking a necessity.
Dr. Giray, who lists the reasons for the habit of sucking fingers in children, says: "Finger sucking is a phenomenon that occurs from birth to 3-4 years of age".
Most babies suck their thumbs.
The child sucks his thumb to satisfy his need for suckling as a baby, and after 1 and a half years, he sucks his thumb to satisfy and relax his craving for his mother's breast.
"He can be bored and distracted, and he can be finger-sucking when he's sleepy, when he's nervous, when he's away from his mother", she said.
Doç, who emphasized that the reason for the behavior of sucking fingers in old age is the lack of parent-child relationship and lack of confidence in the child, Dr. Bilgin Giray explained the effects of this behavior on dental health:
The sucking behavior of the fingers has a negative effect on the formation of the child's dental structure.
The pressure exerted during suction pushes the upper teeth forward, while the lower teeth push back.
This causes the lower jaw to recede, disrupting the balance of the palate and the tooth structure.
And the physiological implication is speech disorder and aesthetically unpleasant closure.
Dr. Doç Giray, who points out that if no early solution is found, a much more complex treatment process can occur in the 6-7 years of age when permanent teeth begin to emerge, "We can protect our children from closure and joint problems before the jaw development is complete".
"So today, children need to be controlled in their oral structure, just like they need to be controlled in their eyes and ears", he concluded.
A new breath in near vision therapy: Trifugal Lenses
Patients who have been treated for cataracts naturally don't want to wear glasses.
And for many years, we've been using multifocal lenses to solve this problem in our patients.
The recent introduction of trifocal lenses has taken the success of treatment in this area a step further.
Trifugal lenses differ from other lenses in that they can provide clear vision not only at distant or near distances but also at intermediate distances.
Treatment of distant, near or intermediate vision disorders
In vision impairment, the interpupil represents a point we use so often in our daily lives.
For example, the dashboard of a car, the portable computer we carry in our lap, or the distance between the arms that we define as being 60-70 cm long.
And because the trifocal lenses also correct the spacing, our patients don't need glasses at all, near or far.
Another advantage of trifocal lenses is that they reduce nighttime complaints.
Eye disease specialist Dr. Volkan Hürmeriç said: "Trifocal lens therapy, which is used for all distance vision treatments, is no different from normal cataract treatment".
Our trifocal patients are easily restored to eye health in a seven to 10-minute procedure.
And the next day, our patients can go back to their normal lives.
It's a life-enhancing surgery, especially for people who drive, use computers a lot, like to read, and lead more active lives.
You can also consult an eye specialist to see if this procedure, which can be performed on any patient over the age of 18, is suitable for you.
You can't use a varicose vein in a heart surgery!
Varicose veins are a disease that has been increasing in frequency in recent years.
In the case of the hereditary factor of genetic proximity, long working hours, long standing and sitting jobs lead to an increase in hereditary complaints.
Do you use veins in heart surgery?
I have a hernia, and people often ask me, "What if I have a heart attack?"
Here are the answers to those questions.
There are two types of collecting system in the leg:
First, there's a deep venous system in the leg called the main artery, which carries the dirty blood to the lungs and collects the dirty blood from the main leg.
These are called the deep femoral vein and the superficial femoral vein.
Problems with these arteries are less common, and when they are diseased, the vessels cannot be closed, and medications are used to keep them open.
In the leg, there's a superficial venous system called the lateral pathway, which carries dirty blood to the lungs and then connects to the deep venous system in the pelvis.
This system consists of two large and two small collective veins called safenas.
In all four of these veins, there may be a failure and a hernia.
The coronary arteries used in heart surgery are superficial coronary arteries called large safen veins.
The absence of these vessels is not harmful to the body and therefore can be used in heart surgery.
But for these vessels to be used in heart surgery, they have to be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
The surgical removal of the varicose veins or the laser burn that leaves them in place also reduces the workload on the deep veins and makes the leg healthier.
There's a common misconception that veins, even hereditary, can be used as a backup.
A varicose vein is never and never used in heart surgery!
There are other veins that can be used in heart surgery.
The backup vascular systems that can be used in heart surgery are located under the chest wall, around the stomach, and in the arm.
So it's not appropriate to wait and worry about using the spleen for the heart.

Meaningful message from Uzbekistan ahead of Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club President Dursun Özbek has issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.
Here are the words of Dursun Özbek, who drew attention to unity and unity in Turkish football:
Galatasaray and Beşiktaş, the two most established and favorite clubs in Turkish sports, will face off for the Super Cup on Saturday evening at the Konya Metropolitan Torku Arena.
This match is neither the first nor the last in a rivalry that has left our two beautiful clubs with a century behind.
But it's a very crucial encounter in terms of timing.
As we all know, our country went through a major crisis on the night of July 15th.
The coup attempt by the FETÖ/PDY, which was aimed at our democracy, was overcome by the unity and solidarity of all sections of society.
We paid a heavy price as a nation that night.
We have martyrs.
We have a lot of gas.
This painful cost reminded us once again of the virtue of democracy, the need and importance of peace and not strife in this land.
That night, representatives of Turkish sports also spoke with one voice and one heart against the coup; all stood together on the side of democracy.
In these critical times, we need the unifying power of sport more than ever.
I wish this match, which coincides with the second anniversary of the death of our dear rival, our dear President Suleyman Seba, and just before the new football season named after our club's legendary captain Turgay Şeren, to be the opening match of the atmosphere of love and peace in Turkish sport.
I wish that whatever the score at the end of the match, the winner will be our country and Turkish sport.

Scot Callum Skinner flies home as Britain captures gold
As the British trio defends their 2012 London title, Scotland's Callum Skinner won the men's race at the Rio track last night.
The 23-year-old racer from Glasgow took on the pioneering role of Sir Chris Hoy from Scotland, and the youngster proudly carried that legend home in triumph in his acclaimed New Zealand dress.
Four years ago, when Hoy won five of his six Olympic golds, Britain had won a shock victory.
And even though Hoy retired, they repeated that by finishing sixth at the World Championship in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert starter Jamie Staff.
They did this right after Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton are trying to fill.
The British coaches had seen Scot's potential and had not given up on Skinner.
Hindes, who was the joint champion with Hoy four years ago, broke the Olympic record in qualifying with Kenny and Skinner, but New Zealand set it again in the first round.
And the British trio, they're in a gold-medal match.
Hindes was a little behind on his own lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held on.
Much of the transformation that allowed Hindes to keep pace with Kenny and especially Skinner, using a larger vehicle to slow him down, was this change in strategy.
Hoy, as the BBC's expert commentator, watched them from his seat and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they took the podium.
"It's an honorable comparison", said Skinner, 23, of Glasgow.
I'm just here to do my best and make my name known.
We broke the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was really incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
Hindes admitted to falling deliberately on the track after a poor start after winning the London 2012 with Kenny and Hoy.
He later reacted to this comment and Britain had no way of demanding it from its rivals.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
"With all the British flags on the stand", Hindes said, "we felt like we were in London".
We're a team that was only formed three months ago.
We've lost so many world championships, so it's an amazing feeling to win again in the Olympics.
This is just an event, a medal for a nation that won seven of the 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress we've made in the last five months, we have five more days of success on the track ahead of us.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of repeating his record of winning three golds in a single Olympics is not too far off.
This would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was born on 23 March (also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a sacred date in British sports history), would have achieved six gold medals and one silver medal.
That's the same level as Hoy.
Kenny will now go to the sprint race, which starts today and lasts three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it right now.
Team activities are always the best.
You can win with your friends.
Honestly, when you win alone, you feel lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
Although this is only today's medal performance, there is much good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-man, four-kilometre team race.
They finished the course in 3:51.943.
The world record of 3:51.659 set by the gold medalist at London 2012
The first round and final will be decided in the second half of the day, and Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
Yesterday, before the qualifying round, he had a disagreement with the staff when authorities called him in to measure his height.
In the women's event, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain relies on a strong cycling team to take the reins and win many medals in the mid-term Olympics.
After a huge lead in Beijing and London, expectations in Rio were greatly reduced.
In the background, there have been many bad developments, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of prominent names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night after the track shows that Britain's epic reputation for finishing in perfect time will be once again proven.
With the cancellation of the power contract, the future of the Portland refinery is in doubt.
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria and the jobs of hundreds of workers have fallen into uncertainty after one of the plant owners announced the termination of a supply contract, leading to the termination of all supply contracts with the energy company that supplied the plant with energy.
The move follows a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government to keep subsidies on hold to keep the facility running.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland plant could be at risk.
Any closure could put up to 2,000 jobs directly or indirectly at risk.
And since the blast furnace consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's entire electricity, there could be additional chain effects.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry refinery, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland refinery is losing money and facing closure.
These developments initially followed several years of speculation over the future of the facility based on the strengthening of the Australian dollar and more recently the cost of consumption.
AGL, which supplies power to the large aluminum smelter from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to act to cancel their contracts.
The vast majority of the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with smaller stakes held by China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means the physical electricity demand of the boiler will continue", he said.
AGL stated that the contracts are "risk-balancing contracts" that must come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month expiration period and will be completed in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL will continue to expect the contracts to contribute to fiscal 2017 as well", the energy company said.
The impacts that AGL may be exposed to on potential earnings in FY2018 and beyond are currently limited to adopting a strong forward contract position for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that the value of their contracts in their accounts has already fallen to $187 million due to "expected breaks".
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the boiler or provide electricity to the boiler".
The US company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which was due to come into effect in November this year, but has not yet explained why it has not withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are wary of the possibility of both the Portland distillery in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle closing due to economic difficulties in the sector.
Stephen Mikkels, AGL's chief operating officer, who responded to analysts earlier this week, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants were to be taken off the market, it would cause a significant drop in demand in the [electricity] market.
And that's not a good development for us as a manufacturer".
Not only is she the star of the Kardashian TV show, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, fourth daughter of model and executive mom Kris' Kardashian-Jenner group, on the cover of the highly anticipated September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has modeled at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked at this cover in a room full of people I love".
Following the cover announcement, a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians-specific) scripted reality video was released featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (rob and Caitlyn, who are troubled at the bar, and uncle Ryan Seacrest, from everyone's favorite show world, Keeping Up producer), the family who later prepared a classic ending: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
While this is the clichéd storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of children's television shows (Seacrest says with cartoon rabbit sincerity at 8 a.m., "Did you think we forgot about you?"), Kris had to somehow involve the other girls in this introduction.
With this development in the September issue of Vogue, we're definitely entering a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's sister Kim may have surpassed her in appearing on the cover of Vogue (she shared the cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a success in itself.
The September issue of Vogue was the best-selling issue of the year.
With its thickness resembling a coffee table book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue has attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista found that 615 of last year's 832-page volume contained advertising content).
The cover star's announcement is also a closely watched process, with images of the magazine leaking before the official announcement for the past two years.
Previously featured women include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more about "modeling celebrities" than "celebrity models".
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, and the following year, the honor was bestowed on Lady Gaga.
But even if Ms. Jenner, described by the magazine as the "shining model" of her generation, were to be placed in the previous category, her surroundings would be fairly good.
These are not celebrities, relatives of celebrities or reality show stars or today's teenagers who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of those things).
These are all women who are legitimate talent, who are prominent in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who was on the cover last year, had one of the best times of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of her reality show background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be troubling.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the slutty of the time".
When news broke that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue, the idea came up again.
But focusing on dissatisfaction seems inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's literally a supermodel.
She's going to Marc Jacobs's shows.
You're getting your Estee Lauder foundation.
She and her sisters sell their own pictures on the paywall apps that you're familiar with.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he took pictures of, to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on a reality TV show, maybe just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids.
Legal aid centers turn away 160,000 people a year
As the sector prepares for the impact of further funding cuts on already-struggling operations, more than 160,000 people from the nation's most vulnerable are being turned away from community legal support centers.
In Queensland, three out of five people (mostly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair eviction orders, etc.) are turned away when seeking free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, having exhausted their potential, are preparing for further cuts.
Starting next June, these legal aid centers are scheduled to lose more than 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrel, Queensland Director of Community Legal Support Centres, said the latest Census Report from the National Association of Community Legal Support Centres found that thousands of people are turned away each year.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would get much worse if the federal government's decision was not reversed.
"Queensland's community legal support centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are unable to access the vital services they need", he said.
People in violent relationships, struggling with the forces that are holding them back, families in the process of separation, and workers who have been unfairly fired... all face problems with a legal dimension and are not getting the help they need, according to this report.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent starting in June 2017, which means thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to deal with more complex legal issues without help.
We urge the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately lift these funding cuts so that people can get the support they need when they face a legal challenge.
Last year, the government delivered on its promise to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
Now we need to look at community legal support centers and the communities they serve and the investment that the Palaszczuk government will make in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team sued after staff allegedly pulled a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team is sued over allegations that the North Carolina operations director did nothing after he was told to pull a gun on a staff member while riding in a jeep in February.
The case was announced Wednesday in a lawsuit filed in state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer on the state campaign team.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be handled from within, but then realized "that's not going to happen".
As Bordini's complaint states, the Director, Earl Philip "took out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and held the barrel to Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, after Bordini complained to local and regional campaign team leaders, he learned that at least four other people had had the same experience as Phillip.
Bordini said in his complaint, "Weapons don't need to be fired to cause damage".
The lawsuit was filed two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused outrage by telling a crowd in North Carolina that "Second Amendment people" (apparently gun owners and gun supporters) could take action if their opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and chooses their own judges.
Trump's campaign team said the media took those words out of context and that he did not support violence.
Bordini is seeking compensation from his campaign for negligence and from Phillip for assault, battery and physical harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Efforts to reach Phillip have been unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.
Bordini, Donald J. Trump For President Inc., case 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, High Court of Justice, Mecklenburg accident (Charlotte) was the first case to be heard by the Supreme Court.
"FETÖ" line to report the witch

New applications are being launched to identify "hidden congregants" who were being thrown out of institutions after the July 15 coup attempt.
"Your friends from that community can be your friends, I say expose them".
You need to report it to the prosecution.
It's a patriotic duty.
"Everyone may not know intelligence, security may not know or catch up, see the men are running away".
Within the framework of the work, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the General Directorate of Security and the National Intelligence Agency (MIT) launched an online reporting application.
According to this, the citizen will be able to pass on the activities of the organization he knows, the institutions belonging to the organization, to the security and the MIT through this application.
The information of persons who will report through the form provided at www.egm.gov.tr/pages/ihar, www.mit.gov.tr/katkiniz links will be kept confidential.
The application of the reporting provided by the General Directorate of Security will allow you to add a document.
Again, the same application will be returned to the whistleblower if he wishes.
Citizens can notify the provincial and district prosecutorships by phone, as well as the 155 Police Amdhat line.
Inspired by Bodrum, they built a 'model village' in Sivas
Canköy, Kaymakamlık and a philanthropic businessman from SIVAS's Gölova District have been made 'example villages'.
In the village, where the roads were paved and pavements were paved with parking stones, all houses were painted blue and white, following the example of Mugla's Bodrum district.
Gölova Kaymakameti has prepared a model village project to improve the image and quality of life of the villages under the district.
In this context, Canköy, a 66-unit village 12 kilometers from the district center, was selected as a model village.
The roads of the village, where infrastructure and superstructure services have been increased, have been paved, and the sidewalks have been covered with park stones.
The houses in the village, which have different shades of color, were painted with the support of businessman Selahattin Ayan, owner of Pelit Pastanas.
The whole village was painted white and blue.
BODRUM is EXAMPLE
Gölova Kaymakamı Erkan İsa Erat, who provided information about the work, said that they prepared this project to sign a work that will be a role model for other villages.
When we started this project, we were looking for a place to sample.
When we went to the basement, we were struck by the white painted houses and blue windows.
We wanted to take the example of Bodrum because of the cleanliness of white and its positive effect on people.
We did our studies and painted all the houses in Canköy white and blue.
This work was done in collaboration with the government and charity.
The project cost about 200 thousand lire.
With the work, our Canköy in Sivas became like a small basement.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and again with the support of our business people.
Abdullah Macit, 66, the mayor of Canköy, said that the village has a new image with the support of Kaymakamlık.
Macit thanked everyone who worked hard and said that being an example village makes them and the villagers very happy.
Drug operation in Kangal
In the Kangal district of SIVAS, 7 people were detained in the drug operation organized by the gendarmerie teams.
The gendarmerie teams working in the county's Chetinkaya Municipality with the help of drug detector dogs seized 600 grams of marijuana, 49 drug pills, 1 hunting rifle and 1 dry pistol.
Seven people were detained in connection with the seized materials and a court case was opened.
Four people were seized along with Gulen in the FETÖ/PDY case in Adana.
It was decided to confiscate all the property of Fethullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Jemal Soncu, who were tried in the 2nd Court of Arbitration for Corruption in ADANA for allegedly providing money to the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization/Parallel State Construction (FETÖ/PDY) by committing bribery.
In a report to the Adana Police Department on May 15, 2015, it was alleged that in 2012, the Deputy Mayor of the city of Adana, Zihni Aldırmaz, and his administration, through building corruption and plan fraud, converted the land belonging to the Kanuni University, which is known for its proximity to the Gülen community, into a residential area, despite no parliamentary decision, and earned the community a rent amounting to 150 million liras.
The investigation was launched on the basis of the report and Zihni Aldırmaz, Ferat Yüksel, Mustafa Vural, Hasan Uzun and former Adana Trade Exchange Chairman Muammer Çalışkan were arrested.
A case has been filed in the 2nd Court of Harsh Penalties against 17 accused, including Fethullah Gülen and former Adana Mayor Zihni Aldırmaz, who are being held for prison terms ranging from 5 to 35 years.
While all the accused did not admit to the charges, at the last hearing of the case, all the detainees and accused were released under judicial control and ban from abroad.
The assets are seized
The court panel issued a warrant for arrest for Omar Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Jemal Soncu, who were on the run along with Fethullah Gülen, the number one accused in the case.
But the court decided to make the fugitive operations for the 4 defendants who were not caught and did not appear at the trial.
The court panel decided to confiscate all the property of Fethullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Jemal Soncu, who were in a foreign country and therefore in a fugitive situation because they could not reach them, in order to ensure that the case against them remains inconclusive.
With this decision, the fugitive defendants' property in Turkey, land-sea and air transportation vehicles, all kinds of rights and debts, valuable documents, shares in the company where their partner is located, rental cash and bank accounts were frozen.

The asset fund that was under scrutiny is back in commission.
Turkey Asset Fund, which is expected to be among the world's largest funds, was banned from the law due to objections.
It was decided to reconsider the fund due to the lack of an audit mechanism, but it was reconsidered in the commission without any changes.
"We are absolutely against the structure of compulsory pension cuts from public assets, from the workers, from the employees, from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, being kept outside the mechanisms of constitutional control", said CHP MP and member of the Plan and Budget Commission Utku Çakırözer, who evaluated the Turkish Asset Fund law proposal brought by the AKP to sozcu.com.tr.
The Turkish Asset Fund bill, which the government has prepared to provide long-term funding for investments and projects, was removed from the bill on Tuesday, with the opposition saying it should be discussed separately.
But today, the AKP has brought the proposal back to the Plan and Budget Commission in the same form.
The deputy of the CHP in the TBMM Plan and Budget Commission, Utku Çakırözer, told sozcu.com.tr about the concern of the CHP regarding the Asset Fund bill.
"When the creation of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission in the bag law bill, former Finance Minister Zekeriya Temizel, who was in charge of the CHP committee, expressed our concerns and concerns, and proposed that the bag be removed from the law and discussed in detail".
The government accepted our view and withdrew the bill.
The bill was reintroduced yesterday in its original form.
"The government seems to be insisting on removing it from the House within a week", he said.
"Our biggest concern in this bill is the irregularity", Chakirozer said.
"The assets belonging to the public, the mandatory pension cuts of the employee, the income from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, the income from privatization, are being transferred unlawfully to a structure that is outside the control of the Assembly and the House of Representatives and has no responsibility", he said.
"But we have a savings deficit", Chakirozer said, noting that Russia, China and the Gulf countries where such funds are established have oil revenues and surpluses from trade and that the fund is financed in this way.
So the fund will be made up of public funds, the people's money.
A total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund, 100 billion from the individual pension fund, which is mandatory for employees, 50 billion without privatization, are planned to be transferred.
"That is, this fund, which will be entirely made with the people's money, must be under public control and this money should not be spent irresponsibly", he said.
He stressed that it is unacceptable that a fund where the state's resources are collected, and where the state's assets are guaranteed in its borrowing, is kept outside the control of the Assembly.
The business and operations of collecting, spending, and borrowing such a large public asset cannot be done by independent auditors alone.
There must be public scrutiny and a transparent structure.
The bill does not provide for the control and transparency of the Asset Fund by the constitutional institutions.
There's no limit to how much resources can be transferred.
No one will be held accountable for how this fund is used.
The purpose of the fund is to finance large projects.
There's no need to create an unaudited fund outside the budget.
Why don't you just budget it?
And then the question naturally comes to mind, "Why is he evading the control of the SAyıştaş and the Parliament?"
He said that they are not against the transfer of money accumulated in the Asset Fund into investments, but they are against it being done through non-transparent, unaccountable mechanisms.
But if the government insists on this, then we have to ensure that the international standards that apply in other countries where such investment funds are established are also applied in Turkey.
It must be structured in such a way that a mechanism of control and accountability is brought in.
It should be set up in such a way that there are no doubts, that the citizen can pay the bill of his own money used to the last penny.
"We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticisms in the Parliament, especially after the attempted coup of July 15", Chakirozer said.
We hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism in this bill.
We oppose the illegal use and transfer of national assets, the irresponsibility of those who use them and the absence of public oversight.
"The Asset Fund requested can only be useful if these concerns are addressed", he said.
It was learned that work was being done to bring about a reconciliation between the AKP and the opposition on the proposed law.
"The investment we make is a sign of our confidence in Turkey"
Speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, Ali Koç, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Automotive, said, "The 30 billion TL investment we have made in the last 5 years is a sign of our confidence in the future of our country".
Koç Holding's Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Automotive Ali Koç and the managers of many foreign-funded companies met at the meeting on "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Ali Koç, speaking at the meeting, said, "Together with our partners, we are not just saying we have faith and trust in our country, we are filling it with our investments and actions".
The 30 billion TL investment we have made in the last 5 years is a sign of our confidence in the future of our country.
Turkey is a country that has a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy in line with international standards, a qualified workforce and an ecosystem that promotes R&D, innovation, entrepreneurship and added value.
In the last few years, our government has offered our industrialists the most comprehensive incentives in the history of our Republic.
"I believe that with these incentives and holistic strategies, we can start a new 'Investment Move' that we need", he said.
"No more incidents are just a problem of one country, we know that as global players".
We came to Turkey with a long-term view.
If we are united and united, our problems will be solved.
We have been able to bring to this land what was not possible in Turkey 160 years ago.
We will continue to be present in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we will build factories, but we must have an open horizon in this area", he said.
"Turkey is one of the 10 countries that Shell has priority in", said Ahmet Erdem, President of Shell Turkey.
We believe in Turkey's potential and future.
We've invested in many areas, starting with energy, and we're continuing to do so.
We thank our President, our Prime Minister and our Ministers for their work in support of international investors.
There are reassuring works for international investors.
"This will increase the competitiveness of our country", he said.
Dr. Altan Demirdere, President of Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and Middle East Region, said, "On August 10, our Global CEO was coming to Turkey".
But the trip was postponed.
We were against it.
Because it was important that the CEO came.
They made requests for bulletproof cars, security.
Then she came here and she saw that everything was normal.
He left his guards and his car and went home happy.
Investing in a country is like marrying.
First of all, if everything goes well, you'll be engaged and married with a long-term plan.
We're married to Turkey and we have no intention of getting a divorce.
He's gone over the edge of the cliff!
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim addressed businessmen at a meeting on "Those who trust Turkey, those who produce in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry at Swiss Hotel.
Prime Minister Yıldırım said that the industry sector is the sector that will provide Turkey with a comparative advantage.
"If we want to be the locomotive of our country and achieve the 2023 targets, we need to think about the industrial revolution, together with the information and technology revolution, and achieve this", he said.
Prime Minister Yıldırım said that Turkey had come back from the brink of a great abyss on the night of July 15. "Those who mean to destroy the future of our country, those who try to destroy democracy, those bastards who do not hesitate to bomb our Gazi Meclis, if they were successful, today we were talking about another Turkey".
We were going to talk about a Turkey among the Third World countries, where the government was taken over by a coup, the national will was eliminated and the world fell out of the league of developing countries.
"Thanks to Allah, with the wisdom of our nation, the leadership of our Commander-in-Chief, the leadership of our President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the determination of our government, we have defeated this calamity", he said.
"We will quickly get out of the impact of this incident and look ahead", Yildirim continued.
It's never right to live with constant blows.
We have very ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake the Turkish economy.
Those who expected chaos and crisis were wrong once again.
Today, our democracy and our economy are in good shape.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to function in a healthy manner.
In 2015, the foreign trade deficit appears to have fallen by 25 percent.
The current account deficit has fallen to 4.5 percent of national income from 5.8 percent in 2014.
We're aiming to get it down to four by the end of the year.
We're never going to change our hard line on public finance.
Turkey's 2016 budget was also above the national income of 130 countries.
We've reduced the national income deficit ratio from over 11 percent to 1.3 percent in 2015, and we're trying to maintain that ratio.
We're better off than the EU, than many countries in the world, in terms of public debt.
Our banking and financial sector continues to operate on solid ground.
"Our central bank has not felt the need to provide currency to the market despite July 15 and there is no reduction in our reserves, we have a gross reserve of over 121 billion dollars", he said.
"We are also making comprehensive arrangements to relieve you of your burdens towards the past", Yıldırım said, adding that the government will provide all kinds of facilities for the development of the economy, increase production and the creation of new employment areas.
We have implemented and continue to implement many regulations, from stock forgiveness to the excess of the treasury and the re-facilitation of the payment of unpaid tax debts.
"You continue to produce for the country, you continue to trust your country, and your government will continue to remove the obstacles one by one in front of you".

The meeting was organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO) and was attended by the Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci.
Speaking at the meeting, Minister of Science Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü said, "I think many good results have come out of the developments that took place on the night of July 15 and after".
The most important of these is undoubtedly the spirit of unity and togetherness that all of Turkey is feeling deeply right now.
The July 15 process showed how strong the dynamics of the Turkish economy are and how much the society has internalized democracy.
"It is obvious that for a society that has reached this level in economy and democracy and democracy, the next process will go better, easier and faster", he said.
"Turkey must get out of this slump"
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said that they are having difficulty telling the world about the attempted coup attempt of July 15 that took place in Faruk Özlü's office.
Zeybekci also referred to the recent interest rate cuts introduced by banks, "If 63.4% of the profits of the top five hundred of my real sector go to interest, we should give up all our work and concentrate on this work".
That's why our president keeps going around and around saying this.
Turkey needs to get out of this mess with the real sector, the banking system, the government, the politics, the unity and unity that politics showed after the Turkish civil democratic revolution of July 15.
We welcome recent developments in this regard.
"I hope that in the coming period, we will support the sustainability and continuity of this competition that started as a nine, eight points of zero per month that the banks started with the encouragement of our President.
"Green passport, we will give to the order of our exporter"
"In the coming period, the world will win, we will be the keepers", said Nihat Zeybekci, "We will not leave a country that has not been visited in the world, under the leadership of our President, Prime Minister, we will not leave a door that has not been stolen".
We're not letting anyone out who we haven't contacted about increasing our trade.
"We will never, ever ignore this", he said, "and we will not be one of the birds in the hand, chasing the bird in the branch".
Zeybekci also stated that in the future, green passports will be given to exporters, "One of the latest decisions that came out of his law, now we have finished his regulation in the economy ministry; we will give our exporters, who represent this country, a privileged green passport, to our exporters, who represent this country, according to the first figures, about 17 to 20 thousand".
"What is found at the entrance to the coup must be cleared by the state"
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek, referring to the attempted coup of July 15 and the declared state of emergency, described the coup attempt as a nightmare.
Shimsek said that the state of emergency was declared for two simple reasons: "Of course, those involved in this uprising and those involved in this coup attempt need to be purged from the state and this process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to avoid facing such attempts again".
And that's the climate that's needed for administrative reform, and the State of Emergency has been declared and so far, very serious structural reforms have been made.
"We have acted within the framework of democratic principles and the rule of law, and we will continue to do so", he said.
He said that life has returned to normal in many areas, and that there is no reason for companies and individuals who are not involved in terror financing to worry.
"I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have been solidified because when you look at the root of the problems in the recent past, you will see that this betrayal network is involved.
"So clearing this terrorist organization from the state, closing this period in Turkey will strengthen Turkey's democracy", he said.
Shimsek said that the economy is generally solid and that they are returning to normal structural reform agendas without any loss of time.
Structural reforms are not our thing, because populism, protectionism, is on the rise in the world.
"Turkey can only prepare for the future by reforming", he said.
Finally, Shimsek stressed that Turkey will not break away from the West, saying, "Turkey may sometimes have differences of opinion with our Western allies, our friends, but Turkey does not break away from the West, it does not give up on the European Union".
He jumped 25 meters into the sea and...
In Antalya, 17-year-old Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı was hospitalized after jumping from a 25-meter-high cliff called 'Eagle Hill' to fish.
Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı, who was swimming with his friends in the evening on the beach of Konyaaltı, then jumped into the sea from the 25 meter high cliffs known as "Kartal Tepi" under the variant.
Shamil Tayyar Flagchi, a professional swimmer, injured his neck after hitting the water.
Flagman, who had difficulty navigating the sea, was brought ashore by his friends, who were also professional swimmers.
Health workers who arrived at the scene took him to Antalya Teaching and Research Hospital.
It was reported that the flag-bearer was not in danger of death.
A friend of Flagrakçı who testified to police, "He got his neck hurt when he jumped from Eagle Hill".
"We didn't see it coming", he said.
25 dead - The Spokesman newspaper

"Mr. President, the members of the Higher Education Council, who are vacant due to the resignation of Seyit Ahmet Baş, have elected Deputy Minister of Finance H. Abdullah Kaya in accordance with Article 6 (b) of the Law on Higher Education No. 2547".
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has approved the "International Labour Law" number 6735.
The statement from the Presidential Press Center said, "The International Labour Law No. 6735 has been sent to the Prime Minister for publication by the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 89 and the second paragraph (a) of Article 104 of the Constitution".
Two brothers died in a gun attack in Kahta
Two brothers were attacked in their car in the Kahta District of ADIAMAN.
The incident occurred in the evening on Mustafa Kemal Street.
A 39-year-old man, identified as Ramazan Karahan, was driving to the district center when he was shot by an unknown person.
The Karahan-controlled car, which lost control in the fire, kept hitting another vehicle.
Meanwhile, the man who came to the car shot Ramazan Karahan and his brother, 50-year-old Ömer Karahan.
The Karahan brothers were seriously injured, while the attacker fled the scene on a motorcycle.
Police and medical teams were dispatched to the scene.
The brothers were taken to Kahta State Hospital by ambulance.
Omar and Ramazan Karahan were treated in the emergency room, but they could not be saved despite all the efforts of doctors.
While the bodies of the two brothers were being taken to the morgue for autopsy, the police, who examined the mob and security cameras in the area where the incident occurred, began work to identify and capture the escaped attacker.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and London, but across the country.
I think that this is going to make Heathrow as attractive as London 2012 as it is, where we're doing an incredible job of making sure that all nations and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympics have provided great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We'll create 10,000 new internship opportunities for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs, and we won't leave young people out of work around the airport.
As with London before 2012, there will be those who think the battle to expand Heathrow is too difficult.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would be a disgrace to the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all the questions.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many people, not just a few.
The expansion leaves the opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion of economic growth, and many skills and job opportunities both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, from T5 (which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row) to T2, implementing a £11 billion infrastructure investment between the world's two busiest runways on time and within budget.
Now, we're ready to offer a third runway backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK, and I have no doubt that the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It's time we channeled this Olympic spirit into the expansion of Heathrow to secure our commercial future and create many skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, chairman of Heathrow's board and former Secretary of State for Trade
Adblock Plus is "like a cat-and-mouse game" when it comes to blocking Facebook ads
Attempts to block ad blocking software for companies that make money from online ads are "cat-and-mouse games", according to one of the software companies.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying its users can update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the codes around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to identify which part of the page is an ad.
But Adblock says it's cracking the new code now.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this back and forth battle between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to block them has been going on since ad blocking was invented", and that Facebook may soon be developing its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company is getting into this fight shows just how big of a concern ad blockers are for the industry.
Last year, a study by Pagefair and Adobe found that nearly 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, four times the number of people who used such software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook on mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
A spokesperson said that mobile ad blockers were being pursued by the company because Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram were not effective.
Since Facebook sees this as a move worth investing in, desktop ads should still be able to generate enough revenue.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences" tool to give people better control over the ads they see.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying, and would block some non-advertising content on the site.
A Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement, "This is not providing a good experience for people and we plan to address this issue".
Ad blockers are a blinded tool, so we're focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
A woman ran onto a Swiss highway , making it look like suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to a multiple vehicle collision on a highway early Thursday in what appears to be a suicide.
The incident occurred just after midnight on Thursday on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman lay "hopelessly" on the ground in the dark of the night and was hit by several vehicles.
A 49-year-old Swedish woman, who was clearly suicidal, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Police said they interviewed several of the drivers involved, but some could not be identified, and asked them and everyone involved to report to them.
"A criminal prosecution has been initiated as a 'logical' step to take in situations like this", lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
But it's not clear if the drivers involved will face any charges.
Could the collision have been avoided?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine", Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers can't be held liable.
The newspaper ruled that in both cases (both involving a person walking on the highway in the dark), it was normal for drivers not to wait for a pedestrian to cross the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer who hit and killed a man lying on the road near Paynerne on the A1 one night in August 2014 was found not guilty of negligence causing death.
The court heard the 22-year-old victim was drunk and leaked on the street.
The court ruled that the police officer responding to an emergency call was operating a vehicle in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone with information about the incident that occurred near Morges on Thursday should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus once had habitable conditions.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus once hosted conditions similar to Earth, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-filled atmosphere.
Scientists have previously attributed Venus' slow rotation to its thick atmosphere.
But the latest estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and could still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of ancient Venus.
Although there are more dry regions of the planet than Earth, it may have once had sufficient water and protection from rapid evaporation by geographical variability.
Ancient Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent fainter.
"The GISS model simulates a slow rotation of Venus that causes the sun to face the day side for almost two months at a time", said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a news release.
This heated the surface, creating rain that formed thick cloud layers that moved like an umbrella to protect the surface from solar heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures were only a few degrees colder than Earth is today.
The model allowed for Venus to form a story similar to the evolution that planetary scientists had previously hypothesized.
Although once habitable, Venus has been subjected to a great deal of heat and ultraviolet light over the course of billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated and the water vapor burned away in the ultraviolet rays.
The hydrogen ran out, leaving behind only a thick atmosphere filled with deadly greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, which is what we know today as Venus.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Journal of Geophysical Research.
Patrick Roy has resigned as Avalanche quarterback.
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday, saying he was not given a say in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic approved the development and stated that the club would immediately begin the search for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations at the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I spent the summer thinking about how I could improve this team and take it to a higher level by giving it the depth it needs.
To accomplish this, the vision of the coach and VP of hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the vision of the organization.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
At present, these conditions are not yet met.
Sakic, who signed Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakic said, "Patrick informed me of his decision today".
We thank him for all he's done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach in his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and led the team to a first-place finish in the league, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the postseason in both years.
The Avalanche surpassed their 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16, and fell five points short of the second wild card spot in the Western Conference.
Roy, the goaltender on the Honor Roll, has won four Stanley Cups, two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers are suspending their strike and continuing negotiations.
The strike of the North Sea oil workers has been suspended due to pay and the chief negotiators have begun discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against the Wood Group, an oilfield services company, is being phased out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
A joint statement read: "We have decided to resume the process of resolving the current dispute with the Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions".
Over the next few weeks, starting early next week, we're going to have a series of all-day meetings to take a fresh look at the issues.
The workers' unions said the protest was their first in 25 years against pay cuts that could reach 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut payments to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressures.
Following the company's fee reduction process, in 2014, a 10 percent price reduction was applied to its coastal contractors.
The company said the additional cuts would provide the company with the space it needs to weather the market's difficult period.
Shell laid off thousands of people as it reorganized its operations in the process of merging with British energy company BG Group and announced plans to exit oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low crude oil prices, an economic situation created by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson will meet with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes in the North Sea.
As he himself said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
"We need an effective economy for the majority, not for the minority, in the North Sea and across the country", he said in a statement.
Despite an average investment of around $7 billion over the past five years, in 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea.
Kepler measured the rotation of stars in the constellation Urquhart.
The Kepler space telescope, with its latest mission, has helped astronomers create the most complete catalogue of the rotation speeds of stars in the constellation Ursa Major.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate at varying speeds and how rotation periods are related to planet formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a news release: "By comparing our results to star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, age, and even the history of the solar system".
The star of the constellation Ulker is 445 light-years from Earth.
Most of the stars in the cluster formed 125 million years ago and are reaching new levels of maturity.
They're spinning at the fastest speed they've ever seen in their lives.
At peak rotation rates, stars in this maturing stage generate a large amount of stellar wind.
These winds cause refraction on the stars as they move through the stars' magnetic fields.
As a star ages, its rotation rate decreases.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time between appearances of noticeable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest rotation velocity catalogue suggests that larger stars rotate faster than smaller ones.
Rebull compared the stars to dancers, stating that the larger ones perform their turn on one foot more slowly than the smaller ones.
Rebull says, "We see that in the Ulker 'ballet' the slow ones are much heavier, and the fast ones are very light stars".
Because the Ulker team is so close to its star, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing rotation speeds with stellar properties.
Rebull said, "The Ulker team provides theoretical models for star rotations in both directions, as young and old as the star".
There's more we want to know about how, when and why the stars' rotation rates fall, why they leave their dancing shoes in a corner, so to speak.
Rebull and colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotation speeds of the Ulker star cluster in three new papers to be published soon in the Journal of Astronomy.
