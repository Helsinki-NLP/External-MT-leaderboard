Fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The fire broke out in the night of Thursday, and no one was injured. The fire department was deployed with about 200 fire engines.
The fire was contained
The building, which is owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU's so-called Seveso Directive, which requires particularly stringent safety requirements, is being used to produce lubricants at the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine.
The chemical plant employs about 400 people and has made headlines in the past - for example, in 2013 when a leaked methanol gas leaked and the surrounding area smelled like rotten eggs.
Woman quits her job to search for 57 days for her missing dog
A Washington woman spent two months searching for her missing dog, and she quit her job in exchange for it. A seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from her hotel room during a short vacation in Montana.
"It was terrible. I got sick", Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. "She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They searched for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had scared the dog
Hoping that Katie might still be in the hotel, Carole King went to the front desk. "The clerk said, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago,'" recalls Carole King to Daily Inter Lake.
With flyers and Facebook group calls, the Kings searched for their beloved dog, but days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope", Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, resigning from her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
Fifty-seven days after Katie disappeared, Carole King got a call: a man called and said Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She was searching the neighborhood, and suddenly her dog was under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go", King recalled, according to Daily Inter Lake. "The tears flowed. People stopped in their cars, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found them".
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
This is the first time that I have spoken to you.
Six MG3s are still missing.
The German army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition in recent years, including three machine guns, the remainder of which is unclear in most cases, and the opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
The Bundeswehr has been losing weapons and ammunition - many of them without a trace - since the beginning of 2014, according to a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, reported by the German news network.
According to the document from the office of the Secretary of State for Defence Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part of a weapon and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have been recovered so far, including six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
The extent of the Bundeswehr's losses of weapons and ammunition is "frightening", said left-wing parliamentarian Martina Renner. This is all the more true since little has been recovered in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance". Renner criticized that the listing does not reveal whether the missing ammunition includes the one found by the Bundeswehr officer Franco A., who was suspected of being involved in the anti-terror investigation. "And this despite the fact that a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possessing this ammunition", Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" has left Iranian port
More than two months after its capture by Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas city on Friday. As ship monitoring data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port.
The tanker had been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters for the time being, the shipping company said, waiting for an official announcement from Tehran.
The Stena Impero was detained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on 19 July, accused of breaching security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker off the British island of Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel praises the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has praised the commitment of the people of the GDR who took to the streets in the peaceful revolution 30 years ago. "Courageous citizens had shaken the GDR regime of the time in the autumn of 1989", Merkel said at a party of the Thuringian CDU group on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt.
Musk is aiming for record shipments
Tesla's quarter may be setting a record despite a surge in deliveries, and the latest losses have been at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a major boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
Musk's circular further stated that demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders. The challenge was to get the cars to customers quickly. To do this, Tesla would have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla's shares went out of business with a gain of over six percent, the highest it had been for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars, reaching its best value to date.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses lately.
Mystery Solved: This Is Why We Can't Tickle Ourselves
A kind of brake in the brain prevents people from tickling themselves, researchers at Humboldt University in Berlin said Thursday evening, using experiments on rats to find out why children resist tickling so violently in order to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the mere approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before it is touched, because of a deep layer in the cerebrum that triggers laughter even when the tickling is expected.
According to the report, previous research has shown that rats with "laughter" in the ultrasonic range respond to being tickled by humans, and this "laughter" is transmitted through the part of the cortex that is responsible for the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
The researchers found that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and being touched by others - which is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, in experiments on rats, the Berlin researchers found that laughter and the activity of the relevant area of the cortex are suppressed during self-touching. This is also true when living things clean themselves.
But if you're touching yourself and others are touching you, you're also suppressing laughter, which suggests that the rat brain can't tell the difference between touching itself and others, and the new findings suggest that people can't tick themselves because the self-touch activates a brake in the cerebellum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves, and in the experiment they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely, showing flight or stubbornness, and this ambivalence is similar to the behavior of children, and the ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral response that is the same in rats and humans.
A major fire at a French chemical plant is averted
The fire at a particularly dangerous chemical plant in Rouen, northern France, has been extinguished, the Normandy prefecture told AFP on Friday, after it broke out on Thursday night.
The authorities said that no health hazardous substances had been released, and that the samples taken were not cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, and schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett 's Lubrizol company
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces lubricant additives. The plant is owned by the US billionaire Warren Buffett's Lubrizol company and is subject to the EU's so-called Seveso directive, which requires particularly stringent safety requirements.
The chemical plant has already made headlines in the past - for example, in 2013, when a gas leak leaked methanol and the surrounding area smelled like rotten eggs.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by his own sister
The prime minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of parliament after the lifting of the state of emergency on Wednesday evening.The prime minister threatens to leave the country on 31 October without a deal if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement.However, it is unclear how he wants to achieve this.
Speaking about Cox, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honour Jo Cox's memory and to reunite this country would be to exit the EU". Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Oslo and Utöya bombing memorials unveiled
More than eight years after the Oslo and Utöya attacks, which killed 77 people, a memorial to the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Iron Roses" consists of about 1,000 iron rose statues, which remind us of the roses laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
The project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be unveiled at the same location - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo, and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers Party on Utöya Island, killing 77 people.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict, but now there is one less problem: the British oil tanker Stena Impero, which was detained in Iran, has been able to return to sea, and it could be a piece of the puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Rouhani.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which has been in Iranian waters since mid-July, is back in international waters and is on its way to Dubai after being released by Iranian authorities, according to Stena Bulk.
The Stena Impero has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now heading to Dubai for medical examinations, said Erik Hånell, the ship's director, who said the ship had left Iranian waters at noon.
The Foreign Office in London called the seizure of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law", it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker on July 19 on charges of violating maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well, according to circumstances, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and distressing situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to reunite them with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that the detention of the "Stena Impero" was a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar, where a supertanker carrying Iranian oil, which was supposed to go to Syria, was chained in early July, in violation of EU sanctions against the war-torn country of Syria, the authorities said.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened consequences, and in mid-August the Adrian Darya-1 was finally released, and London vehemently rejected speculation that it was a barter deal to free the Stena Impero.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents involving tankers and drones.
The tensions between Tehran and Washington are due to the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States had withdrawn in 2018 alone from the international nuclear agreement, which was supposed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressuring the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and expanded agreement in other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the "Stena Impero" dispute and other incidents involving oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition to provide military protection for commercial shipping in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz to the UN General Assembly in New York.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India is actually destined to be the "winner of the war". In the face of the punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reorganize. Finance chiefs of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country cite India as one of their preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. This is not only due to the uncertainties of the Sino-US trade war, of course. With a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have been created for this, in which a more diversified global production chain seems to play an important role.
But now, India itself has come under Trump's spotlight. Depreciated by the current White House as the "kingdom of tariffs", America withdrew the emerging country's trade concessions on 2,000 products in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitive tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
The US is the world's largest democracy, and the US is the world's largest economy. India is the world's largest economy. India is the world's largest economy. India is the world's largest economy. India is the world's largest economy. India is the world's largest economy.
The problem is elsewhere: the empirically-confirmed thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is a difficult one in the socialist Republic of India, even under Modi. His zeal for reform is primarily aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has suffocated all entrepreneurial spirit in the multinational state for too long. Companies are now getting faster building permits. They are benefiting from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more robust insolvency and bankruptcy law is creating the conditions for liquidating high-debt companies more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, India has improved a lot in the first five years of Modi. But in trade policy, this is not the case.
In the West, Modi is the charismatic reformer who is radically renewing his country economically. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. But at heart, the "India First" advocate never deviated from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the shutdown of their industries are among the core members of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and this blatant policy.
Jacques Chirac's funeral in Paris on Monday
The former French president Jacques Chirac is reportedly to be buried in Paris next week, the former head of state will be buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital on Monday, the AFP news agency reported, citing Chirac's family.
The competitors are on target: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
The world's best was already in the goal when the heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled down Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to dangling dangerously. He could hardly stand on his feet for well 300 meters before the goal, ran in an unhealthy curved posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly cut him and dragged him supporting him the last half of the stadium round. The forces were enough for both, however, to stop the hour-long bracelet run after the finish. As if the curious scene had not been enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same", Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. Shy at first, he didn't want to talk about his feat at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup by the World Junior Association. Under normal circumstances he would not have been allowed to start. "That's why I am proud to run for my country here", he said.
He did it that evening with determination - and much more intensely than he had thought. Because this heroic act will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his competitor Busby take the lead in the goal and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well over five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this advance.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying in Lisbon, competed to set a personal best time at the Doha World Championships, which he achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, according to official data, but he was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I've been under 18 minutes".
Millions of Egyptians prepare for a day of violent protest
In Egypt, security has been stepped up in anticipation of possible anti-government protests, with a heightened police presence in central Cairo on Friday, several metro stations closed and roads around central Tahrir Square blocked.
Police have already stepped up their roadblocks in recent days, searching pedestrians' mobile phones for messages and photos related to the protests, and arresting hundreds, according to two NGOs.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, hundreds of protesters took part in protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansoura against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who critics accuse of corruption and abuse. Such an open protest against the political leadership had not been seen in Egypt for years. Egyptian contractor and actor living in exile in Spain, Mohammed Ali, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "million-man march" in central places across the country this Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution".
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise, according to two observers, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counting more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported more than 2,000 arrests.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW said, citing lawyers for the detainees.Accusations against the detainees range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist association", according to their lawyers.In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothes, interrogated and searched bystanders, according to HRW.
Human Rights Watch also criticized the censorship in the North African country, saying the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Easier for mail order companies to give returns
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods, and about 20 million returns end up in the trash.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
The Ministry of Finance, in response to a question from the Greens' parliamentary group, which was reported by the newspapers of the Funke Media Group on Friday, said that although companies could not be exempted from sales tax on donations, the dealers could lower the market value of the unsold returns so low that they would not have to pay any or only a small amount of sales tax.
Researchers at the University of Bamberg found that when ordering goods on the Internet, Germans return one in six packages. About four percent of the goods - some 20 million products - ended up in the garbage. According to the current legal situation, donating them would cost companies extra money, because the financial authorities consider donations in kind as a turnover, which is then subject to sales tax.
Green leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify by decree that companies cannot properly value products for sale and donate them to charities free of charge.
Banksy art for auction: There's never been a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of street art star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is about to be auctioned.
Branczik said Banksy's work "highlights the re-creation of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy in the basic way of life, characterized by animals and tribes". The painting is due to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital from Saturday until it is auctioned on October 3 and is estimated to be worth between 1.5 and 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of the UK, where Banksy lives, and the artist had the painting re-exhibited that year, coinciding with the original Brexit date of 29 March, when the work, formerly called Question Time, was renamed Devolved Parliament.
The painting could change hands for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a tough blow to the opposition at the first sitting of the House of Commons after the Supreme Court lifted a mandatory break imposed by Johnson, who wants to carry out the Brexit on 31 October, which has already been postponed twice, if necessary, even without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time Banksy, whose identity remains unknown, has intervened in the Brexit debate.In Dover, in southeast England, he painted a picture of a man smashing a star of the European flag with a chisel, which is seen daily by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the UK.
The Brexit debate is like a walk in the park.
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament are not contributing to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the campaign ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday. "We enjoy it. We will leave (the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had been attacking Brexit opponents in Parliament in recent days, accusing them of "betraying" the people, and accusing him of "humbugging" MPs who might be in danger of being targeted by death threats.
Cummings said the only way to restore calm was if MPs finally respected the British decision to leave the EU, saying it was not surprising that people were upset that Britain had not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the heated atmosphere, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak to each other with respect", said a statement. "And we should listen".
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
In an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, has again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If it goes badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst". The UN would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it".
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers control a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. In early August, India had stripped the Indian Kashmir region of its autonomy, thereby sharply increasing tensions with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is responding to the protests in Egypt with a hard hand, firing live ammunition at the population, over 2,000 detainees joining the 60,000 political prisoners in jail, and protests have never been safe in Egypt, but since the seizure of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring.
But one of the reasons for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation, poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by their own government, which drove millions to the streets, and this is a problem that even the el-Sisi regime is not able to control, no matter how harshly it treats its opponents.
Today, one in three people in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is 10 percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for repression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was the case before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarian regimes, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It becomes critical when large parts of the population have difficulty affording a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests at the terminal: BER chief: No more "showstoppers" for the capital's airport
The complex interconnection of the BER fire protection system has been tested for two months, and the operators are satisfied with the progress, but the TUV is not yet finished at the BER.
After extensive Tüv testing at the terminal of the future capital's airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there were still shortcomings to be worked out in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until the commissioning still contains buffers.
The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the building authority during the first quarter of 2020, as was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables still need to be fixed, and Tüv intends to check them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the resumption of air operations, intensive work on the removal of the defects will continue", a written notice said.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable tracks hang. The airport manager expects that this will be available by the end of the year.
The problem is that the fire protection system at the station crossing below the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke curtains that go down like a canvas in a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. 36 engines have to be replaced. Then there will be new experiments with hot gas fumes at the beginning of the year.
The airport was originally scheduled to open in 2011, but due to fire safety issues and other construction defects and planning errors, the cost has increased from two billion euros since construction began in 2006 to around 6.5 billion euros for opening next year.
As the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the airport's expansion is being planned, as announced by Chairman Bretschneider at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Finance chief Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, personnel chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on solid feet.
Chemnitz: Police arrest man after blasting of drug vending machines
He needed money for drugs - and for that he blew up several vending machines in the Chemnitz area!
In the last two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply, causing millions of dollars in damage!
The police arrested a 33-year-old German man after two bombings in late May on the Bürgerstraße and the Furtherstraße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "During the investigation into the cause of explosions in the Tate unit with a particularly serious case of theft, conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitz now confessed to a total of eight crimes.
The police spokesman said: "The loot was used to finance his drug addiction". The bomber had blown up parking machines on the Bürgerstraße only four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage caused amounts to at least EUR 60 000!
The bomber is in custody and the police investigation is continuing.
It is also believed that he was responsible for other suicide bombings in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reversing its strategy for Vienna Airport amid the price war with low-cost carriers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", a spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed to the APA on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This will be taken over by the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", so including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained.The flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights.The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub on the one hand and to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states on the other.
According to AviationNetOnline, Eurowings is only a production company for its sister company AUA in Vienna. Barcelona and Rome, for example, would be served with AUA flight numbers but mainly with Eurowings equipment. The on-board product would be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants would be from Eurowings. Eurowings flights departing under AUA flight numbers would no longer be produced in Terminal 1 but, as reported, in Terminal 3 as the AUA.
The Irish low-cost carrier is sending four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticised as a circumvention of the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's campaign saying that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years, AUA board member Andreas Otto responded on Friday: "We will remain the number one location in five, six or ten years".
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: The cousins were best friends as children. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British royals: During the Italian holidays earlier this month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped to ask for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31), the palace announced on Thursday.
"We are extremely excited to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to be embarking on this adventure together and can't wait to be married", the couple, who have been together since October 2018, according to British media reports, said in the official statement.
And he goes on to say, "We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will help us greatly in the years to come, full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and posted on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled for 2020, and details of the date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
But what is certain is that the marriage of the number nine in the British line of succession and the real estate mogul will be a similarly large celebration as Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank on 12 October 2018 (33).
Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but what really triggers heart failure or heart attack?
By analysing the genetic material of 9,000 people, scientists from Hamburg and Switzerland want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular disease.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) said on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros.
The researchers, who are now looking to compare the complete genetic material of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients at the University of Cambridge's cardiovascular centre, have found that the risk of cardiovascular disease is due to genetic factors, such as obesity, smoking and poor diet.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes contain possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - and about 200 more are added each year, the clinic said.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks, and to use the data to investigate other popular diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University's Cardiovascular Centre, who believes that new insights into the interaction between the heart and brain, the heart and kidneys, and cancer can be gained.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases. The Foundation's clinic in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who are also participating in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the clinic.
The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on October 1, 2020, and all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 boys who were tortured and abused from a Koran school.According to local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were minors, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were mistreated.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught the Quran and "improved", but in fact the guardians were held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhuman conditions", Sabo said.
The Koranschool reportedly existed for about ten years. Residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koranschool, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the Muslim-majority north of Nigeria, where many private Koran schools are replacing often deficient government institutions, people in the region are often attacked by armed gangs, which has led to more than 40,000 people fleeing across the border into neighboring Niger in the past 10 months, according to the UN Refugee Agency.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
Police have rescued nearly 400 students from terrible conditions at a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that suggested torture", said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children were discovered in an Islamic school on Thursday, after a tip-off that conditions there were "inhumane", and the school principal and six teachers were arrested after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, were held in their school as slaves and chained, some were sexually abused, and television images showed students in disfigured and injured condition.
World Cup: More accusations after Messi and Klopps's death
Football "Signature is not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded the prize
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Federation is awarding the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year, the sixth time Lionel Messi has been honoured, and a record.
After the captain of Nicaragua declared that he had never voted in the World Cup, other countries have accused FIFA of not rating Egypt at all - with a curious reason.
Much has been proven to be scandalous at FIFA in recent years: the World Cup bids, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials.However, the FIFA World Cup election has not been suspected of being dirty - apart from the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote on sympathy rather than on objective assessment.
But after the Nicaragua captain complained that he had not voted at all, further discrepancies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
FIFA apologized for the fact that "the signatures on the ballot papers were in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian federation was contacted several times to clarify the situation - without a response.
Sudan's coach is also surprised
The Sudanese Federation has also expressed its dismay at the vote, saying that while the situation in Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Federation has said that the vote was not as it was in the end: Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second and Sadio Mane in third.
The Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera also had been accused of "not voting for the #TheBest2019 awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you", he wrote.
The announcement came on Friday: "Yes, but it was not an intention", and the completed ballot papers were "erroneously" signed by Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan national team, the announcement said, but the second captain, Manuel Rosas, was actually elected. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", the announcement said, adding that both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte voted for Messi, "just as it is on the official FIFA list".
The other cases are now being investigated by FIFA, but it stresses that the election process was externally overseen by the consultancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
Ukraine affair: senior Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have spoken out in favor of an official investigation of US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important", said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where this goes from here will be determined by the facts that are established". He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far been reluctant to criticize Trump over the whistleblower affair, with few expressing discomfort over it. Scott's comments are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Another senior Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, spoke in favor of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation", Baker said. "The proper course of action and the responsibility for Congress is now to investigate and get to the bottom of it".
Scott and Baker, as governors of US states, have no formal say in the Trump case being decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore symbolically important. However, early Republican senators have also expressed criticism of the situation. Mitt Romney, who represents Utah in the second chamber of parliament, for example, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also reported that the first cracks were opening up within the Republicans.
The case could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump, who the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into, accusing him of abusing power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political gain.
There is no exact timetable for impeachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could attempt a so-called impeachment. But the decision on an actual impeachment falls in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have a majority. The prospects for the success of such a process are therefore slim. So far, no U.S. president has been removed from office by an impeachment process.
Were there any torturers aboard Racket's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for allegedly raping and murdering in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after illegally steering the Sea Watch 3 rescue ship with 53 Libyan refugees aboard in the port of Lampedusa.After fierce protests and international criticism - including from Austria's President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new serious accusations are being made against Rackete, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps who may have arrived in Italy on the Sea-Watch 3. The suspects were arrested in a reception camp in Messina, Sicily, after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule that out, but we don't have any reliable information about it ourselves", said Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured and even killed in the North African country, including Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence", the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They are coming without passports", said Neugebrower. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated".
The former Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini demanded an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk is aiming for record deliveries at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a major boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
Musk's circular said that demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, and the challenge was to get the cars to customers quickly, which would require Tesla to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla's shares went out of business with a gain of over six percent, the highest it had seen in nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars, reaching its all-time high.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are needed in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses lately.
US budget dispute: Just another bridge funding
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget, and the Senate on Thursday agreed to a transitional budget until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year starting on October 1. The Senate on Thursday followed the House of Representatives and passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) until November 21. Without such a resolution, there would have been a shutdown, a partial closure of the federal government, at midnight on Monday. President Trump has yet to implement the resolution.
Shutdown reversed
The Federal Administration is now being funded at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year ending on Monday, 2019, because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and agencies in time.
The Democrats have completed 10 of the 12 bills in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending bills reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate, and the Senate has more or less 10 of the 12 spending plans, which are barely majority-capable.
The spirits are divided mainly on the issue of resource allocation for Homeland Security and Border Protection. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump's big priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the wall plans and their funding, which is actually for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the wall construction had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The ghosts are separated at the construction site
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should take a decision on the implementation of the budgetary procedure, which is to be followed by a decision on the budgetary procedure, and that the Council should take a decision on the implementation of the budgetary procedure.
In the face of the continued failure of Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in time and the associated threat of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination is to be open to single women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of a government bill that would allow all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is expected to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate.In the three-day emotional debate, critics on the right-wing warned that in the future, many "children without a father" could grow up.The French bishops' conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society, reflecting the modern family, with children of one parent or with homosexual parents, and the idea that the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be covered by social insurance.
Infertilization with sperm from dead husbands still prohibited
The National Assembly rejected by a narrow majority an amendment which would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husbands for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past where women complained in vain about the delivery of the sperm of a deceased.
Many members of the ruling La République en Marche (Republic in Motion) party of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had opposed artificial insemination using the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be subjected to "double grief" if her desire for children was not fulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now unsuccessful amendment consider it unfair that a widow may in future be able to have her own sperm fertilized by a stranger but not by her own partner.
Until now, artificial insemination in France was only allowed to heterosexual couples who could not have children. They must be married or have lived together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be banned.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for higher fees for universities
The university is a big target for air travel, so the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future.
The universities are also to limit themselves to flying.
The debate on climate taxation on flights from universities and colleges, which had been suspended before the summer break, is back on track. After the regional rectors' conference had reacted skeptically to a similar push from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university are advocating for compensation for business flights. This is "urgently necessary" as a first step, while there must be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, their opinion says. The cabinet decision, originally planned in July, is still on the green because the CDU has not yet approved the proposal.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the arrested fishermen were illegally fishing in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen had already been arrested. At that time, there was a shooting between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later died of his injuries.
The Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages, and the North Korean fishermen were reportedly in Russian waters, where the Russian coast guard is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources, according to its own statements.
30,000 squid seized
The new inspections revealed that 30,000 squid had been found on the boats and seized, and three fishing boats and two motorboats were reportedly seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authority had also not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year after complaints from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been arrested there on occasion this year, according to media reports.
Georgi Martynov, head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Primorje Region, recently complained about the high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who were fishing with artificial nets, which were banned in Russia, and were also used to extract small creatures from the sea, and the nets were simply dumped into the sea, where they took 200 years to decompose.
18,000 to go: US lowers asylum cap
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here in a meeting with elected police officials at the White House.
The richest country on earth is shutting down asylum seekers: the State Department in Washington has confirmed that the cap on the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered, with the future focus on threatened believers and Iraqis.
The U.S. government wants to lower the historically low threshold for admitting new refugees once again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020, the U.S. Department of State announced that a maximum of 18,000 people will be allowed into the country. In the fiscal year that is now almost over, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to accept asylum seekers from around the world in recent years, and under the previous administration of Barack Obama, the limits were much higher.
The targeted cap of 18,000 would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the State Department called the United States "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a phrase that echoes the language of the current U.S. president.
"Responsible treatment" of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, Trump said.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to close. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure over the Selensky affair and a potentially threatened impeachment process.
The US government will focus on accepting two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis who helped the US military in the country and were put in danger, according to the State Department statement, while Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador will accept a maximum of 1,500 refugees.
The United States wants to see people from this "northern triangle" of Central America seek asylum in other countries, and in this context it has signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration on the southern US-Mexico border.
Court orders orangutan released from zoo
A female orangutan has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a human monkey holding facility in the United States at the request of Argentine justice. "Sandra", born in 1986 at the Rostocker Zoo, has been granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release is mandatory. The animal was flown to Dallas on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, however, but in the cargo compartment, as lawyer Andrés Domínguez explained.
The 53-kilogram-long human monkey is unable to adapt to life in the wild, so it will live in the open-air enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida, where 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are housed, including "Bubbles", formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 lawsuit by animal rights activists over "Sandra"'s fundamental rights has helped turn the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecological park.
Swiss record for extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Extreme climber Dani Arnold has successfully completed another hussar ride on the almost 3,000-meter-high Great Zinc in the Italian Alps.
Without nets, double floors or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-meter-high northern wall of the Great Wall of China in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, beating the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in the free solo speed at four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sportswear manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit increase despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion (nearly $1.3 billion) in the past quarter, up 25 percent from the same period last year, the company said on Tuesday, mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", which the Adidas competitor uses to reach its customers directly online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three months to the end of August, while Nike's sales in China rose 22 percent, and the Beaverton, Oregon-based company also benefited from its approach to reaching consumers directly through the Internet or smartphone apps in the People's Republic.
Nike's chief financial officer, Andy Campion, announced that Nike would continue to push the "digital transformation" of the sportswear manufacturer with strategic investments, thus expanding its competitive edge. Investors responded with delight to the quarterly figures - the sportswear manufacturer's shares rose by more than five percent.
Lifetime ban from stadiums for racism in Italy
The Brazilian defender Jesus was insulted by the fan on Instagram, and Jesus posted the private messages and urged his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am", wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Roma since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday, reporting the fan's Instagram account and the police, and saying the Roma fan should never attend a game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved and this is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums", said FIFA president Gianni Infantino at the weekend. The statement was prompted by racist chants at the first-team game between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on Sunday.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rallying fans of record-breaking Juventus Turin from the stadium, four of whom are banned from entering the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said, while the rest are banned from four to seven years.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against 12 leaders of ultra-fan groups in the Juventus area, accused of serious extortion, money laundering and private violence, among other things.
The ultra leaders are allegedly behind the ticketing scandal, according to Italian media reports, which claim they "militarily controlled" the ticketing for the fan-running event and allegedly blackmailed Juventus staff to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole generations are given catchy terms. If you look closely, the labels are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the particular way young people feel about life?
"The crabs are coming!" This was the official start of the crab fishing at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun on September 21, marking the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee Public Affairs Department announced.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to be rich.
The people of Gaochun started crab farming as early as the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that provides high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively strived for large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as technology-based crab farming. And the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and the incomes of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform of "power distribution, optimization of administration and government services", and has carefully built up the service network for "permits under one roof, one law enforcement team, one service network, one lending platform".
Gaochun is fully exploiting the local advantages of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and is using the development zone and its status as an international "Slow City" as a flagship to establish smart high-end production enterprises, biomedical and medical technology enterprises, energy storage and environmental protection enterprises, cultural and healthcare enterprises, and organic farming enterprises that are leaders in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all-area tourism zone and tourism of national importance. In doing so, the environmental and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape have been integrated by the service to citizens, and the "high-level" cultural and cultural resources of the Gaochun public service buildings have been developed to further improve the "energy and energy" of the tourism sector and the "high-level" tourism sector.
Conflict between Iran and the US: Rouhani speaks of ending sanctions - Trump disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions after returning from the UN General Assembly, and the US offered to end all sanctions in return for talks with Tehran's leadership, Rouhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no".
Rouhani describes the situation as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were in New York and insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says I'm lifting the sanctions", Rouhani added. The type of sanctions that should be lifted was debated. "And they clearly said we're lifting all the sanctions".
However, this push was not made in an acceptable way, Rouhani criticized, saying that given the sanctions in place and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Rouhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
A major earthquake near Istanbul - nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes hit western Turkey in a short time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
The government announced that 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, and hundreds of buildings had been damaged.The 5.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the Marmara region outside Istanbul on Thursday had caused panic in the metropolis of millions.Now the government is planning to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay said.
Turkey has not been prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored.Every year, poorly built homes collapse - including debris from the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces registered as shelters in the center have long been built on top of them.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara, just outside Silivri district, at a depth of about seven kilometers, the disaster management agency Afad said, with a smaller aftershock causing even greater panic on the streets minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage were initially reported.The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of their homes in panic.Students were evacuated from buildings in Silivri district for security reasons.Some students were crying as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake prone. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul, which killed more than 17,000 people.
Researchers fear that a magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 earthquake could threaten, but it is unclear when it will occur.
Companies are drawing up contingency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go-bags with everything you need ready by your doorstep, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after returning from New York that eight people had been injured, some buildings had suffered minor damage, and Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, following developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), said that two minarets of mosques in Avcilar and Sariyer districts had collapsed.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
Many users of social networks reported panic: buildings were shaking, schools and hospitals were evacuated, telephone lines were cut off, it was more violent than Tuesday, wrote one user. The head of Turkey's Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks, and urged people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the quake is stated as 13.59 (local time) according to official data, and a few minutes after the first quake, there was a second quake, reported by CNN Turkey, with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
On Tuesday, a 4.6-magnitude earthquake hit the Turkish Marmara region, felt as far as Istanbul, and centered on the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis, the disaster management agency Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake to make headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a major earthquake.
Researchers predict that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that at some point it will discharge - and cause massive damage.
Seismologist Sukru Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning, making it more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be signs of a larger earthquake", Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later, the big earthquake will come".
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the implementation of the common position, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to make a number of changes to the common position.
Parliament: New fuel in the Ukraine affair
Two breaking documents are fueling the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment, the US Democrats are strengthened: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president provide important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as the victim of a "witch hunt".
United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - airman diverted
A United Airlines flight was diverted because a passenger was trapped in the board toilet, and the toilet door was blocked during Flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to U.S. media.
The woman was finally released from the cramped cabin during an unscheduled mid-flight on Wednesday evening in Denver, according to U.S. media, citing other passengers, who had to change planes to continue on to San Francisco.
A video posted on the Internet, which is believed to be from US media, shows several people trying to rescue the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?" says one man. The airline has apologized to all passengers.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He's writing a book about it -- and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", the British bestselling author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" will be published on November 27, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who in his previous life was ignored or hated, but now suddenly is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people, and is determined not to let anything or anyone stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If parliament is shut down so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers are shamelessly lying like the Soviet leaders once did, if Brexiteers in high places are practically blaming the disaster of a no-deal, then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to that: write". McEwan had only published his novel "Machines Like Me" about artificial intelligence in the spring.
First published in 1915, Kafka's story is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and finds himself "turned into a huge insect", gradually excluded from family and society, and finally destroyed. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world turned upside down", said Diogenes' publisher.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11,200 cars in Austria and Hungary are being fitted with whisper brakes to reduce noise from freight trains, and sections of the railway between Graz and Györ and Vienna Neustadt and Sopron are being modernised and electrified.
The EU authorities say this will make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, with funding coming from the EU's infrastructure fund, the Connecting Europe Facility.
Thomas Cook: All travel cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all travel until 31 October 2019 inclusive, one day after filing for bankruptcy, and travel could "not be undertaken for reasons of insolvency law", the company said on Thursday evening.
The company also said that it would consider the possibility of extending the term of the agreement to the following years: "The company will not be able to extend the term of the agreement to the next five years, unless the agreement is signed by the parties and the company is able to extend the term of the agreement to the next five years".
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the grip of the bankruptcy of its British parent company and had filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. e company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs some 2000 people in Germany.
Insurance company wants to transfer money to hotels now
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take the necessary measures to ensure that the Member States' legislation on the protection of workers' rights is implemented in a way that is consistent with the principles of the Treaty on European Union.
Based on the booking information and without the presentation of separate invoices, hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travellers from these hotels are no longer required to pay individual hotel bills or otherwise", said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who claimed to have been forced to pay for their accommodation on the spot, some of which had to put more than €1,000 on the table, a move which was sharply criticized by the German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres.
The number of hotels affected will be agreed on Friday with the insolvent travel company, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday's data, there were still 70 000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers travelling from Germany.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The newly announced hotel payouts by Zurich Insurance are only helping travellers who are currently on the road, and it's looking bad for Thomas Cook customers who are just planning to fly on holiday. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travels up to and including October 31 would be cancelled, including those bookings that have already been paid for.
The company has not disclosed the status of travel starting from 1 November 2019 and said that it will review the further procedure in coordination with the insolvency insurance company.
The company refers to the Zurich insurer, represented by Kaera, which offers customers information on the Kaera website on how to obtain a refund of the travel price and a claim form on the internet.
Prince Harry destroys mines in Angola
Prince Harry has long followed in Lady Diana's footsteps, and in Africa he is now following in his mother's footsteps.
Dressed in a blue shell casing, British Prince Harry detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a British Halo Trust camp near the town of Dirico, he set off the detonation circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded in the savanna landscape, without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his African tour, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same bomb master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to retrace the path she had taken. The pictures of Princess Diana walking through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, starting in the tourist metropolis of Cape Town, South Africa.
Brexit negotiations raging: the risk of no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that he was not going to guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what he said is a statement that has been a constant in the polarizing British. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court of Great Britain is like a sword of Damocles hanging over the head of the blonde. His suspension of parliament in order to pursue his Brexit course until the exit date was annulled earlier this week. And a law passed by parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks until 31 October if negotiations with the EU fail. However, Johnson had categorically ruled out this again and again.
Boris Johnson thinks a deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to be going away on Johnson either, who, meanwhile, made a visit to a hospital and hinted that he would support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October if there was no agreement:
You know, we're gonna follow the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And I'm cautiously optimistic that it will work.
And time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. There are still about six weeks left for the EU and the British negotiators to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal. But even the most recent talks have failed to achieve a breakthrough. A deal by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the exit date is in place. The opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. They fear that Johnson might somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this regard, the US Health Department CDC announced. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, there is no known similar increase in lung damage so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
The Spanish-based architect and actor has called for a "people's revolution" in which he called for more protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement, and for mass rallies with a million participants in central squares across the country.
The security authorities are in any case alarmed.In the center of Cairo, a heightened police presence has already been observed.Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.Already in recent days, the police had increased their road controls and searched pedestrians' mobile phones in part for messages and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, hundreds of protesters took part in protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, the first such open protest in years in Egypt, and the security forces reacted harshly. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since last week, many of them arbitrarily - simply because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW said, citing lawyers for those arrested.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country, which says the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi, who has ruled the country since 2013 after toppling democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Foxes returned from Greenland expedition
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday, and was greeted at the port of Hamburg by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic on the yacht "Malizia".
Fuchs and a team of scientists had spent the past few months on his sailing ship Dagmar Aaen off the coast of Iceland and Greenland investigating and documenting the effects of global warming.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the polar researcher, who had been waiting for years for the younger generation to speak out, and who had known for decades that the Earth was warming, yet many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea is often done behind closed doors", said Fuchs, who and his team wanted to educate people about the effects of global warming and ocean pollution, including measuring Greenland glacier ice using a drone and fishing for microplastics using nets.
"For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model", said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic over the last decades".
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti and fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill, which included 80 euros in tips, was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which provoked heated reactions.
"Such cases are damaging to the reputation of Rome. We urge the police to investigate whether this is a fraud", a spokesman for Federagit, the association of tour guides in Rome, told the Rome daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The restaurant's owners immediately reacted. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the owner of the restaurant justified himself. However, this is not clear from the bill. Even a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
After the turbulent revelations of the past few days, US President Donald Trump may indeed be facing impeachment proceedings, which the Democrats want to check with their House of Representatives inquiry as soon as possible - it's weeks before a decision is made.
The alleged beginning of the scandal is the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who brought the conversation to the public with his complaint about national security and democracy of the United States, is monstrous: the president abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to influence the 2020 election. He used Ukraine's dependence in this way to blackmail and force them to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now-published transcript of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not give the full wording.The July 25 phone call is only one episode of a much larger story, the centerpiece of which is, alongside Trump, his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins in public view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet the newly elected President Zelensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation, which we have the right to do", he tells the newspaper. It may be inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal about it". Giuliani wants investigations to be conducted in Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and could prove helpful to my government".
The lawyer and former New York City mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies focused on Trump's 2016 presidential opponent: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct a pretext for the Russia investigation in the US.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will be talking about so prominently on the phone with Selensky in July. Giuliani's and the president's version is: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, as the Ukraine commissioner of the Obama administration, pressed for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian attorney general Viktor Shokin. This is to stop the investigation he was responsible for of the gas company in whose supervisory board his son was active. Biden senior blackmailed Ukraine Hunter financially to cover up his family's corrupt machinations.
In fact, the process was a little different: when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general should leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Shokin himself was also accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was by far not the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal.
Instagram, Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media is down
Users around the world are reporting massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. This means that Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has been unloading since about 3:30 p.m. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more frequently affected by disruptions
This is not the first massive outage this year, as services were down for several hours in March and July, and as in previous cases, users are turning to Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force. They were on a submarine and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - it took less than an hour for the Chilean rescue helicopter to rescue them.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, and just before 10 we started, and 20 minutes later we were over the barge".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977 with 19 scientists working there.
Note: Do not charge your smartphone wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive techniques via Qi standard are extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently been launched on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - most notably the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
The researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally via cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours.
Capacity and life
According to the researchers, the temperature is a crucial factor in the battery life. Every degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does not last as long as it should. The life span is therefore shorter. The researchers therefore advise that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since battery replacement in modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a useful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of battery replacement - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on a suitable charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and even cars - and the battery is charged without the hassle of cable salad and cumbersome plug-in smoke.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer claimed to have climbed 13 of the world's 14 highest mountains in just six months, setting a record for reaching the summit of Manaslu in Nepal, according to his expedition manager.
Purja, who calls his project "Mission Possible", has made headlines internationally with a viral photo of climbers lined up on Mount Everest in the spring.
The image of mass violence sparked a debate over increased security measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain, the world's highest peak, which in May had killed 11 climbers in a matter of days.
Purja's problem may be the 14th-century climb: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xiangbangma mountain in Tibet, citing bad weather as one of the reasons.
Four dead elephants found in Sri Lanka
Among the dead were a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned".
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the famous and frequented ancient rock fortress of Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were believed to be between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year, often by farmers whose land the animals had previously been kept harmless, and about 50 people are killed by elephants each year, usually when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants remain in Sri Lanka, and killing them is theoretically punishable by death.
British oil tanker detained leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was seized by Iran, the Bandar Abbas Maritime Authority announced, according to the IRNA news agency.
Management of Thomas Cook in the critique
The House of Commons' Economic Affairs Committee is to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook in detail, including the board's salary package and why the British government would not give the struggling company a financial boost. "We are interested in the supervision of the company as well as the control by external auditors", said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London.
Experts say genes are overestimated in bowel cancer risk
The role of genes in the family increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. This conclusion is reached by researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are therefore likely to weigh heavier than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual colon cancer risk, emphasize the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk is pushing Tesla stock up
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek".The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular continued.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, and to do that, Tesla needs to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
The investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with a gain of over six percent. So strong has the price not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value so far.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses lately.
Will the British government circumvent the Brexit law?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a low profile on whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the latest law passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticises as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday suggested that Johnson might try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and that Johnson might use a procedural ploy to postpone the law's entry into force until after the EU leaves.
Johnson said he was seeking a deal with the European Union. "We are confident we will leave the EU on 31 October and the best way is with a deal".
Iran is apparently increasing uranium enrichment
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European partners in the dispute over the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states are showing inability or lack of willingness to take concrete actions", Rouhani said at a press conference on Thursday on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, and in case they fail to live up to their promises, he envisaged "further steps" away from the agreements of the painstakingly negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which included the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations in return. The United States withdrew from the agreement in 2018 alone, to force Iran to change course in what was considered aggressive Middle East policy with "maximum pressure". The administration of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now reimposing harsh sanctions on Tehran. Iran recently responded by reinstating the limited uranium enrichment in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing to use the centrifuges installed in early September, and according to the IAEA, Iran is preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
The European Union has also been involved in the negotiations with the United States, which have been held in Brussels since the end of the year, and the European Union has also been involved in the negotiations with the United States.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Britain followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack.
"Those who make such accusations must present proof", Rouhani said, adding that European leaders had not been able to do so in their talks with him during the UN General Debate, but had instead relied on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this.
Rouhani demanded that the US administration's far-reaching sanctions be lifted before possible talks with US President Trump, and he urged the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, a first for the comet, which allows us to draw conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest crossing our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer, and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The long-traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in the Crimea - with a self-built telescope 65 centimeters in diameter.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be observed in a transit of our solar system, after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get close-up views of an alien solar system before it disappears forever. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun at this distance", reported Davide Farnocchia of NASA in a press release.
The comet is on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which leads it out of our system, according to the analyses, and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar sister star, which was initially listed under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
"The object will reach its maximum brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will be visible only with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, with a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, estimating the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometres in an initial study.
Researchers at the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and that suggests that their composition must be similar", reports IAC researcher Julia de León.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned ESA satellite mission.
The agency wants to station the three-piece spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (comet interceptor) at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028. According to ESA's science director Günther Hasinger, it is to lurk either on an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new Daxing mega-airport
Just in time for the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, the first passenger plane of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
The new airport is expected to handle around 45 million passengers annually by 2022, and 72 million by 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450-billion-dollar project.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automated air traffic management system.
The opening of the capital's airport, which had been under construction since 2006 and was much smaller, had been postponed several times, but the first passenger plane landed in Beijing after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney
The UK Space Agency is dreaming of a four-and-a-half-hour flight from London to Sydney, a dream that will be made possible by a special synergetic air-breathing rocket engine (Sabre) developed by Reaction Engines in Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN reported. "This is the technology that could definitely do it", said agency chief Graham Turnock.
The Concorde was the only supersonic passenger transport aircraft to fly between New York and Paris from 1976 until it ceased operations in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours to complete. In 2000, a Concorde launch accident at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport killed all 109 people on board. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to work with the US space agency to develop a supersonic aircraft called the "Nasa Galactic Plane".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", Reaction Engines writes on its website, among other things. The Sabre propulsion could be used for efficient travel at Mach 5 - five times the speed of sound.
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous whistleblowers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine case of possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information", Trump told staff at the U.S. Embassy in New York on Thursday, saying the person involved was almost a "spy" and that such people had been treated "a little differently" in the past than they are today.
The event was not actually public, but several US media outlets circulated audio clips of the speech on Friday, and Democrats reacted angrily to the president's statement.
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced Tuesday that they are preparing to impeach Trump, based on a written complaint by an anonymous intelligence official who has made serious allegations against Trump and his administration.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US president is "using the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in his favor in the US 2020 election.
The allegations center on a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate allegations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, including Biden's son Hunter's previous business dealings in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his nephew from Ukrainian justice. Biden is leading the race for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up the Ukraine phone call: senior government officials had tried to keep the exact transcript of the conversation under the covers. As usual, an electronic transcript was made. This was removed from a database usually provided for this purpose by White House lawyers, but instead was stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough transcript of the conversation has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, but the New York Times reported that it was an employee of the foreign intelligence agency, the CIA.
Trump again questioned the source's credibility on Friday, in a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had spread second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate, so there may not be any tipsters or spies at all.
Trump's comments in New York about those who allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower sparked outrage, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted with concern, lamenting that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various committees have been investigating Trump and his entourage for months, and in light of the Ukraine allegations, Democrats are now pushing ahead with new vigour to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation", said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accusing him of misrepresenting things and again demanding the committee chairman's resignation. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials in the security and foreign policy fields, most of whom served under Democratic and Republican presidents, backed the Democratic-led impeachment investigation, which, if confirmed, would be "a reckless abuse of power" by Trump, said a statement released Friday.
There is no exact timetable for the next process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could attempt a so-called impeachment process. But the decision on an actual impeachment falls in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have a majority. The prospects for the success of such a process are therefore slim. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment process.
VW works council: Jobs are being 'sneaked'
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the works council of the carmaker. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of which 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
The 'Future Pact' negotiated in 2016 between the company and the works council already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from works councils, jobs in production which were not actually available are being "sneaked" off by another route - i.e. bypassing the official course, so that regular jobs which become vacant are often not re-employed.
The fact that the works council had no means of forcing the re-employment in these cases. Meanwhile, many jobs were lacking staff, the workload was increasing, the worries about a gradual bleeding out of the car factories were growing. This also increased the fear that vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and centrally control new projects, which will also reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim being to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production manager Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the looming trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof".
The company's production costs are expected to fall by around EUR 100 million in the coming year, while the production costs for the Golf 8 will be reduced by around EUR 100 million in the coming year.
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter produce components. For Wolfsburg, VW has the rule of thumb that 800,000 cars must be built there annually to make the plant satisfactory profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems in the transition to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedure WTPL.
As Tostmann, the head of production, announced last year, a million cars are to be rolled off the assembly line in Wolfsburg in the 'future' period, which will enable the production of the Golf to be bundled at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant will be converted into a site for the production of electric cars.
The Volkswagen Group also produces the Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUVs in Wolfsburg, but the sales of the Golf and Tiguan have been declining recently, so expectations now rest on the Golf 8.
Forced to prostitute herself with Voodoo: Trafficking convicted
Young Nigerian women have been sworn in, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers are facing jail time.
Six suspected Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to probation and up to eight years and three months in prison in Bochum on Friday for smuggling young Nigerian women into the Ruhr area and forcing them into prostitution, forcing them to take voodoo vows at home.
The victims were aged between 17 and 22 years old and were transported by Libyan smugglers in tugs across the Mediterranean Sea, but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted to smuggling and then distributing the young Nigerian women to brothels during the trial. "The work made it physically and mentally difficult for the women", said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the sentencing. "Some were really disgusted".
The convictions are for commercial and gang-related smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and serious forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the Ufo flight attendants' union has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on October 14 about the strike measures in the LH Group", Ufo's tariff director Daniel Flohr said on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate with the Ufo for months, including the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
The decision was upheld by the court and the company is considering whether to appeal. "I think it is unlikely that a second court would see the matter completely differently", said Flohr, the UFO board member.
In August, Lufthansa also filed a petition with the Landarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed by the court, arguing that the union had not had a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
The first was a fierce leadership battle in the Spartan union, during which many members of the board and advisory board resigned, including long-time union leader Nicoley Baublies.The UFO had suspended a pre-vote on a flight crew strike at Eurowings at the end of July because of doubts about its leadership.
Ease of entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but that is about to change, as the Persian Gulf country is introducing new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia aims to attract more international tourists, increasing the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million a year by 2030, the tourism commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country", said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has been difficult to access for tourists.Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state.With the new rules, the conservative kingdom hopes to increase tourism revenues.Riad says it wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the most important oilfields in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery at Abkaik and the Churais oilfield.As a result, national oil production fell sharply, oil prices shot up.It is expected that it will take several weeks for the kingdom's oil production to reach its old levels.

Two dead in Czech plane crash
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in western Czechia. The wreckage was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), police said. The dead include a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the plane since Thursday evening after the crew had issued a GPS distress signal. A military helicopter was also in operation. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of Europe's tree species are threatened with extinction
Besides pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causing the threat, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) reported in Brussels on Friday. It has examined the stocks of all 454 known tree species in Europe, 265 of which are found on no other continent. Of these 265 species, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of threat, and thus on the verge of extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: "potentially endangered", "endangered", "highly endangered", "threatened with extinction", and "extinct in the wild" to "extinct".
Red-breasted and wild chestnut threatened
In Germany, the most threatened species are the sorb (Sorbus), said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because their populations are small anyway or because their habitats are being transformed or weakened".
The most threatened species is the Balkan miniature moth, which has been spreading across the continent since the 1980s from south-eastern Europe and has few natural enemies. The IUCN estimates that the number of wild chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe is less than 10,000.
Shrubs and Moose Also at Risk
The IUCN scientists also compiled new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than one fifth of molluscs and moose and nearly half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of wildlife, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, which form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet", said Luc Bas, IUCN Director at the Bureau for Europe. "We need to limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make protecting these species a priority".
Earthquake near Istanbul: 34 injured reported
Turkey's vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said Friday that the latest earthquake in Turkey has injured 34 people, left dozens homeless and closed 14 schools in Istanbul for safety reasons.
The quake, which had a magnitude of 5.8 on Thursday, shook the Marmara region outside Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
The government is now planning to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake prone.Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disturbance, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was a 7.6 magnitude quake in 1999 near Istanbul, with its epicenter in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul, killing more than 17,000 people.
Already on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake had shaken the region around Istanbul, and authorities urged residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will host the halftime show of the upcoming American Football Super Bowl Final, the singers announced on Twitter. "It's not going to get any bigger", Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage.
Jennifer Lopez said she's dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - when she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the halftime show. "It's even more special now because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina". She can't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira said in a statement that she is honored to be standing alongside another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world, representing Latinos from the US and around the world. "And then on my birthday too!" The main sponsor of the event tweeted that it was the first time the two "queens" were on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fighting against falling viewership
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and halftime show are among the most watched TV shows in the United States. Even though viewership has dropped recently: this February, the spectacle attracted the fewest viewers in the United States in more than a decade. Despite this, it still averaged nearly a hundred million people.
The Super Bowl halftime show had been a riot: In the quarrel over the dealings with quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, according to media reports, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had been on the ground during NFL games in 2016/17 protesting police violence and racism, and had his knee removed during the national anthem. With his protest, Kaepernick sparked a movement, with many players taking over the gesture. This caused a great deal of excitement, with U.S. President Donald Trump attacking the mostly African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been out of the league since March 2017 and has not played an NFL game.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press release, some banks are likely to face high costs as a result of the bankruptcy of travel company Thomas Cook, which is threatened by high depreciation rates on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, the Financial Times reported in its Friday edition.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would have to write off up to £1.8 billion (around €2 billion) on their books, the report said, according to estimates by the consultancy AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of between £900 million and £1 billion and lenders between £550 million and £825 million, with the actual amounts to be depreciated likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the paper.
The Commission has also been asked to assess the impact of the new measures on the environment, the environment and the environment, and to assess the impact of the new measures on the environment and the environment.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule that out, but we don't have any reliable information about it ourselves", said Ruben Neugebauer, spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, to the dpa news agency.
The three men were accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya, and were arrested at the reception camp in Messina, Italy. The developer stressed that the refugee organizations could not verify who they were allowing on their ships. "They come without passports".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment, which is to be adopted by the Council on 1 January.
US warns German government against Huawei
The head of the US Internet authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese networking provider Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great", Pai told the "Handelsblatt" about the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests", the FCC chief continued, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to require suppliers to provide a 'declaration of trustworthiness'.
Berlin will first try to control the risks, for example by technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible.
The software is important to keep the equipment up to date, and this software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time", Pai said.
It is "very hard to imagine" that a government agency "wherever it is, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks", the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is not transparent, and the employee company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government", Pai told the Handelsblatt.
The US has been given intelligence indicating that government officials are being placed inside the company, and Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the US position.
Chemical plant burns in northern France: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic firewall lights up the sky over a chemical plant in northern France. The fire has been extinguished after hours - but the cleanup work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and kindergartens in the region remain closed.
The Ministry of Interior had urged citizens to stay inside buildings as much as possible and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, the prefecture said. There is still a risk that the smell will spread after the extinguishment, the prefecture said on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police and gendarmes were on duty at the scene of the fire.
The chemical plant had previously been the scene of a giant black smoke column, and French media reported huge fires and explosions at the Lubrizol factory, a manufacturer of oil additives located a few miles from the city center.
The factory in Normandy is, according to the authorities, in the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites which are subject to special surveillance.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples, but that pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out, and that dams had been built in the river to prevent pollution, the prefecture said.
The fire broke out in the early hours of the morning at around 2:40 a.m., authorities said, with the cause initially unclear.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better", said Le Maire on Thursday evening, when he presented the French budget for the coming year.
The minister warned that the economy in the eurozone was weakening.
We cannot wait for the economic situation to deteriorate before making the necessary decisions.'
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances and their derivatives is a step in the right direction.
The French government has not had the opportunity to do so, the minister added, referring to the high level of public debt in his country, which amounts to more than 98 percent of gross domestic product.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to increase public investment to revive the European economy, and German politicians have repeatedly called on France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow Vests movement, which has said that the new debt will fall to 2.2 percent, from an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evades question on Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister, Johnson, is sharply critical of the "capitulation law" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos-like Brexit, but critics fear Boris Johnson could use another loophole, but when asked about this possibility, the Tory politician avoids it.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a low profile on whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the latest legislation passed by Parliament to prevent exactly that.
The law provides that the government must request a delay in the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticises as a "capitulation law" that would make negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had on Thursday expressed the suspicion that Johnson might try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that would delay the law's entry into force until after the EU leaves. Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31st, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he viewed the political debate over Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the intended EU exit would still happen: "We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave, don't worry", Cummings said at a book launch, according to the British newspaper Telegraph.
Cummings, who led the "Vote Leave" campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now the chief strategist at Downing Street, the UK's government headquarters, and is said to be behind the uncompromising policies that have left the prime minister in a situation of near-impossibility.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney, which is a very good book.
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin -- they were all in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who became one of the great rock photographers, but it doesn't always have to be the glamour.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until her death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the booklet "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of Linda McCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film".
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona before she found photography, had her camera with her, and she's made thousands of Polaroids, several hundred of which are now published for the first time in The Polaroid Diaries.
"She wanted real moments", writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. Of course, there is always one in the center: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, he uses a bathrobe to talk on the phone with a bag over his head, or he wears a disfigured moonboat. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a very normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland. Mary McCartney told the BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed her father had made out of old potato boxes. And it wasn't always the case with the McCartneys.
Unlike most other media, the Poloraid camera captures the instant, and Linda McCartney's images are certainly a kind of family diary, but they're much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo is happening in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment", said Paul McCartney. "If you snap it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo". And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing the exact right moment. "She just knew she had it", Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the cut and the colors are all right, which makes The Polaroid Diaries not only a fun picture book for Beatles fans, but also an anecdotal, aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes can be seen as abstract paintings, the perfect complement to the newly released Beatles album Abbey Road, which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighboring country despite the US sanctions against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there", Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey has problems importing Iranian oil because some companies have withdrawn "because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and many other issues", said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran.
The European Union has been a major player in the development of the region, and the EU has been a major contributor to the development of the region.
The US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. government is seeking to drastically limit the number of refugees it accepts, and the State Department said Thursday it would lower the annual cap on resettlement from the current 30,000 to 18,000, an average of 40 percent.
The State Department said that while the United States remains committed to helping refugees, its primary responsibility is to protect and serve American citizens, and that the U.S. immigration system is currently overburdened.
The U.S. government will focus on accepting two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis who helped the U.S. military in Iraq and were put in danger, according to the State Department statement, while Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador will accept a maximum of 1,500 refugees.
The program, which was established in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The cap of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program's history. The current cap of 30,000 is a record low. When U.S. President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
Aid agencies reacted in horror to the announced lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America", said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, adding that the United States would further damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States, legal and illegal, and the U.S. government is expecting 350,000 asylum applications in the next fiscal year, according to its own estimates, which are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Close to being a spy"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever gave the informant who accused him of abusing his power "is close to a spy", Trump said, according to a recording of a private event Thursday in New York, several U.S. media outlets reported concurrently.
So Trump was speaking to the staff of the American mission to the United Nations, and when he was asked who was the person who was giving the whistleblower information about controversial events at the White House, he said, "That's like a spy". And then Trump added, "You know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and the betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now".
The Democrats sharply criticized Trump's remarks, accusing him of intimidating witnesses, and attempting to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment trial against him, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees wrote.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now-published complaint of abusing his office to request interference by another country in the 2020 U.S. election. Specifically, it concerns his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyy in the summer: in the conversation, Trump suggested he open an investigation against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is not yet clear who the whistleblower himself is or who his informant is, but the New York Times reports that the whistleblower is an analyst with the foreign intelligence agency, the CIA.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddler drowned in Aegean
The Commission has also made a number of recommendations to the Council and the Council on the implementation of the common position adopted by the Council on the common position adopted by the Council on the common position adopted by the Council on the common position adopted by the Council on the common position adopted by the Council on the common position adopted by the Council on the common position.
The Greek coast guard said that seven migrants were killed when a boat sank off the Greek island of Chios, including a baby and four children, and that four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
The migrants had left Turkey in the morning and had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios, which lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The countries of origin of the migrants are not yet known, but hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently crossing the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean, mostly in much too small boats, which last year claimed 174 lives, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The Who cancel concert
A concert by the American rock band The Who was abruptly ended by the inability of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to work. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should leave it while it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey "can't really talk right now".[21] Townsend promised the audience that he would come to a concert to make amends for his loss, but no date has been set.
The Who cancelled their scheduled shows in Dallas on Friday and Denver on Sunday, and are expected to be joined at a later date by 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend, the only remaining original members of the British cult band formed 55 years ago.
WeWork is causing real estate markets to shake
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
In a matter of years, WeWork has gone from a small startup to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis, and landlords are worried about billions in revenue.
The crisis of office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance of the world's largest real estate markets. The company had just days ago removed founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet to executives to gain financial room for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork leases large office space for the long term and short-term leases it to members in small units. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at a breathtaking rate. Last year, the company recorded a loss of $ 1.6 billion, with a turnover of $ 1.8 billion. This year alone, the rental costs due to the rental of new and larger spaces are said to have increased to an estimated $ 2.5 million. To limit the loss, the new management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the rental of new spaces with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in more than $40 billion in liabilities, and these huge liabilities could become a problem not just for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented nearly 300,000 square feet of office space in Manhattan, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, over the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly-marketed space at the time. Without WeWork's expansion, office space in the U.S. metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in "Business Insider". Similarly, WeWork now operates several dozen office space in the best position.
In the UK capital, too, the balance of the housing market could shift noticeably without further expansion by the aggressive startup, including WeWork, which is the main tenant in an office building in the centre of the financial metropolis bought last year by savings bank fund provider Deka for just under 100 million euros.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investment. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billion-dollar revenue. They do not have access to the - scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term leases. Because the lease of the individual locations of WeWork is usually done by specially established subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only limited in liability.
Russia again detained numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian coast guard has taken action against North Korean fishermen again, with a total of 262 poachers arrested in recent days for illegal fishing in the waters, Russian domestic intelligence agency FSB reported to Interfax on Friday.
The report, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union, states that the United States has been "a major player in the global warming crisis, and that the United States has been a major contributor to the global warming crisis".
The North Korean fishermen were reportedly in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian coast guard is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources, and where the new inspections have detected 30,000 squid, three fishing boats and two motorboats have been seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok, and the coast guard has recorded more than 8,000 violations in 2018, according to the Ria Novosti news agency.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had also not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year after complaints from local entrepreneurs.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynow, recently complained about the high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who were fishing with artificial nets, which are banned in Russia, and were also using them to extract small creatures from the sea, and the nets were simply disposed of in the sea, where they took 200 years to decompose.
The Russian border guards first captured a North Korean boat on September 17 and then a second one after it opened fire, according to the FSB.
US bans entry to former President Castro
The United States has imposed an entry ban on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, the U.S. State Department said in a statement Thursday, citing Castro's involvement in "grave human rights violations", as the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean nation, which has a system of arbitrary detention of thousands of Cubans and more than 100 political prisoners.
As the head of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also guilty of human rights abuses there by supporting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. "The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and use of force to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela", US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed travel bans on officials from the Venezuelan government and military, among others.A fierce power struggle has raged for months between the government and the opposition in Venezuela.The United States has imposed a series of sanctions on Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and help bring opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies, receiving oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of medical personnel sent to the socialist Caribbean island. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are taking to the streets today to demand more climate action.
To mark the end of an international climate strike week, Fridays for Future is planning to hold another round of actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world, starting with New Zealand and Australia, before the protests spread across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to attend a large-scale demonstration in Montreal, Canada, and in front of the White House in Washington.
"Last Friday over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we're doing it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
The number of people who took part in the protests in Germany last Friday was particularly high, with a good third of the world's protesters - around 1.4 million - taking part in protests in 575 German cities, according to Fridays for Future. This time, according to a listing by the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller towns and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thunberg stood before the Swedish parliament to urge the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection, which soon gave rise to the Fridays-for-Future movement, which is mainly attended by students and students, but increasingly by scientists and other adults.
Together they call for greater political ambition in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe, in particular the Paris climate agreement, which calls for global warming to be kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just over a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise on an ocean racing yacht, where she had recently attended climate protests and UN summits, and on Monday delivered an emotional speech at the UN, where she spoke to the world's leaders, and in her hometown of Stockholm, where she was awarded the Right Livelihood Foundation's Alternative Nobel Prize for her efforts to improve climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
"This also applies to smoking", a spokesman for the Emergency Ministry said Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass news agency.
If the cigarette ignites a fire, the penalty is higher. According to the ministry, the ban also includes burning candles.
Cybercriminals are being targeted - investigators are removing servers
In the fight against cybercrime, German investigators have for the first time identified a major server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting a number of websites used by international criminals as data centre operators in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel.
The prosecutor's office in Koblenz said seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a major operation.
The suspects' clients include the operators of the world's second-largest darknet drug marketplace, Wall Street Market, which investigators had smashed in the spring.The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers in late November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyberbunker, according to the Attorney General's Office.
The Commission also considered that the Commission's decision to initiate the procedure was not sufficient to justify the Commission's decision to initiate the procedure.
The access operation, which was supported by special forces such as the GSG9, involved searches in Germany and neighbouring countries, and was the result of almost five years of investigation.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are taking to the streets today to demand more climate action.
To mark the end of an international climate strike week, Fridays for Future is planning new actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller towns and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Who are Thunberg's backers?
Justice and courage are great virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that are warming the climate. Even more amazing is the fact that a 16-year-old girl is holding a mirror up to the powerful people of that time. But what is behind it? Is it the helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Is it a historical masterpiece or a manipulative tactic for her own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is moving the masses and getting young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, this is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to attract a collection of children and young people to himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne felt chosen to fight for a more just world. At that time, he was also able to attract a crowd of young people to himself and persuade them to cross the sea to get to the Promised Land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently made the trip to America on a sailboat.
But there is a dark side to this: why do we need a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? Plus, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother published a book that sold well, thanks to her daughter in the spotlight. Even Greta Thunberg's long-time followers were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the boat trip was probably too much for some of her followers. This is not unfounded, because the imposition was very well received in the media worldwide and a lot of money flows through the action.
The question is: is it morally right to enrich oneself financially in the process of saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the process of saving the world? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy is based on different opinions and discussions.
Comet discovered: interstellar guest crosses our solar system
An alien comet is crossing our solar system right now.
Astronomers have confirmed their predictions: A comet is passing through our solar system - only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Scientists have long suspected it, but now they know for sure: A comet from another star is crossing our solar system, named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer, and is currently busy astronomers around the world.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in the Crimea
The object was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov in the Crimea. He looked up into the sky with a telescope he had built and further observations confirmed his initial suspicion. It is in fact an unknown comet not from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be spotted during the flyby.
The great opportunity for astronomers now is to get a close look at an alien solar system. Apparently the comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Institute of Astrophysics. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic path that takes it out of our system.
Comet has been observed before it touches the Earth and can be observed for several months
But before that, astronomers can observe it closely, because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach, meaning that it can be observed from Earth for many months. "The object will reach its maximum brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explains Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. space agency NASA. "After that, it will be visible only with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
The previous owner of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua'.
Early findings on Comet 2I/Borisov give hope to scientists
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be between 2 and 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comet - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our own, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
But the discovery of two such objects in just two years may open up a new way of studying certain processes in other solar systems.
Researchers are constantly concerned about asteroids, and only recently did a giant asteroid pass by the earth and come dangerously close.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson appalled by brother
Boris Johnson is getting lonely, first his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister is clearly criticizing the prime minister's warlike language as "disgusting", not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", "contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is continuing to arm himself - at least verbally.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words like capitulation as if opponents of leaving the EU should be "hanged, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered". She finds this extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who stood for the EU parliamentary election for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
She was particularly struck by her brother's mention of Jo Cox, an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons who was murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 Brexit referendum. The best way to honour her memory is to go through with Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It's very tasteless to refer to a member of parliament who was murdered by someone who shouted 'Britain first,'" Johnson's sister now criticized. The perpetrator apparently came from the far-right camp, feeling empowered "by that kind of language". For all those who mourned her, it was very tasteless.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos's name is used like that", he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand passionately and decisively for what you believe in - no matter what your opinion. But you should never "demonize the other side". He also lamented that an atmosphere had developed in which attacks had become more likely.
Just weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and Tory MP. "I have been torn between loyalty to family and national interest for the past few months - it's an unresolvable tension", said Jo Johnson, who explained the move.
Johnson's speech also came under sharp criticism within the Church. According to the Times, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticized the language as "unfit for this country". In a joint statement, they stated: "In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has been unacceptable. We should speak to each other with respect".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is making a strong statement in its 100th year, with two women of Latino heritage performing at the Super Bowl halftime show, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will host the halftime show at the upcoming NFL championship game, organizers announced Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because they have an incredible strength in the United States", Shakira shared in a video.
The American Football League's 100th anniversary final is scheduled for February 2 in Miami, Florida, a city at the southern tip of the state with many Latin American roots: Shakira ("Waka Waka") is from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican descent.
"I love that the Super Bowl is bringing two women on stage this time - and two Latinas", Lopez said, sending an important message to all Americans and the world that the show will be "an explosion of fun and energy".
Born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico, Lopez is a 50-year-old singer who has had a number of hits in the 2000s with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" and "Let's Get Loud" and has also released songs in Spanish.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a telenovela star and singer. She achieved worldwide success in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the United States every year, and this year many consider the selection to be a political gesture, as the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policies of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest sporting event in the United States and a huge commercial spectacle. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there.
Last year, there was political controversy in the run-up to the game, with quarterback Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand up for the national anthem, in protest of police violence against blacks, and being harshly attacked by President Donald Trump, among others. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians refused to play at the Super Bowl, including Rihanna and Pink.
An actor and Youtuber is approaching Egypt's ruler: for now, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have the power to make sure that blood flows back on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them floated back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former general who deposed the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, in 2013, had a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's actions against political Islam and had lost no words about human rights abuses at the Nile - in a week in which Egyptian security forces arrested hundreds of people for refusing to take protests against the president. "He was more than a few feet away", Sisi said, "from the ground in the Egyptian airport", where the state microphones "did not dare to lead them to the wrong place".
Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, avoiding the security forces who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old actor was known only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafes, living rooms and tea rooms: with his YouTube channel "Mohammed's Secrets", Ali calls on his countrymen to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president revels in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said. The military leadership on which Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly these gentlemen for 15 years in his second career as a construction contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the click-through numbers that are about to explode show.
After thousands of people demonstrated against his rule last week for the first time since Sisi's seizure of power and nearly 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million-man march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would actually take to the streets. But there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protesters denouncing al-Sisi's corruption and demanding his departure.
In the Nile Delta city of Mansura, where protesters tore up banners with the president's portrait last week, a massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the roads that were not working. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance" work, most of the roads around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in Ra Square, where supporters of the fallen Muslim Brotherhood Mursi sheltered until the army fired on them in 2013 and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent discontented people from gathering: Sisi wanted to hold a large rally for the president, which was planned for the future.
Mohamed Ali said that these measures led to a change in his tactics: "Our target doesn't have to be Tahrir Square", Ali said in Barcelona to his video camera. "Let's not clash with police officers". But as a retreatist, this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much
If the internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are several checking options.
The Internet contract does not require blind trust in the speed data of the providers, but customers can check for themselves how much of the speed is actually achieved in the event of anomalies.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore be met, explains the Consumer Centre of Bavaria.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various checking options: the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", the Consumer Centre Bavaria states on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can give the provider a reasonable period of time, usually 14 days, to deliver the promised service, which is best done in writing by means of a letter of objection.
If this does not work even after repeated requests, customers can resign and may even demand compensation.
First senior Republican to be investigated
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it goes from here will be determined by the facts that are established", Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday, saying he wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken - an impeachment proceeding could lead to the president's ouster.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the interventions of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump had been watching Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far held back from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair, with few expressing discomfort over it. Scott's comments are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policies on several occasions, including easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Another Marvel film planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland should proceed.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man will receive a third final film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home".
Screenrant magazine quotes Marvel boss Kevin Feige as saying, "I'm excited that Spidey's journey will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are extremely excited that we can continue working on it... he's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey version. You never know what the future will bring".
But what is the sudden good news? Sony Marvel is said to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also owns Marvel, would share 30 percent of the revenue from upcoming Spider-Man movies.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the United States has now reached the grand finale. In the final episode there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, was charmingly paid tribute.
Ahead of the finale, Duchess Meghan did not return for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes, but instead, some of the retrospectives re-enacted the most memorable scenes with the current Duchess, such as the moments of her failed and successful marriage to Mike, or her welcoming him after his prison sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is about to walk down the aisle to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned when a refugee boat capsized in the Aegean Sea, killing seven people, the Greek coast guard said Friday, adding that the nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants are currently crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, where 174 people died last year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The European Union is committed to the implementation of the European Union's common foreign and security policy, and the European Union is committed to the implementation of the European Union's common foreign and security policy.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday that Seehofer was planning to travel with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Greece continues to see an unusually high number of migrants from Turkey, with 654 people crossing over to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increased numbers have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement of 2016, which allows the EU to send back all refugees and migrants illegally arriving on Greek islands via Turkey, in return for which the EU wanted to take in one Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
The Greek authorities have been unable to process asylum applications due to a shortage of staff, with just under 29,400 people on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, and the worst situation on Lesbos, where 5200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with a capacity of 650 people.
The number of refugees has never been higher since the EU-Turkey refugee pact entered into force in March 2016, state broadcaster RAD reported.
Climate change: Heat is leading to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "certainly" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system was affected by high temperatures and large temperature jumps within a short time and led to more heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician must answer for embarrassing photo
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cups manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green leader is pictured holding a reusable cup, but now it turns out that the cup has been tampered with.
Ottawa/Canada - It went unnoticed for quite a while - and finally it did. The reusable metal straw coffee cup was never held in the hand by Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Greens. On the party website, she was seen in a photo with this cup, talking to citizens. However, the photo had been published before and also circulated to the media - and the cup was still a snappy (dad) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green boss has to answer for photo-taping
The National Post accused May of manipulating the party and producing fake news to make it more credible on the issue of environmental protection, in the midst of a House election campaign in which Trudeau is also facing increasing pressure over a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked a discussion about fake news, with one user sharing a counter-image of the photos and writing: "The Greens are manipulating a photo of their chairmen to hide their inaugural cup".
May was shocked and claimed on her blog that she had no knowledge of this action. To emphasize this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, holding a cup. However, she correctly stated that it was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A party spokeswoman said that it was only to accommodate the parogo part in the picture, and not to cover something up.
May writes that she feels sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide", she tells the Guardian, and asks her over-engaged team: "If you ever feel like editing a picture again, can you do something to my face to make me look younger?"
The German Greens have also been in shitstorms because of their use of single-use plastic or because of air travel - their pictures were not photo-shopped, however.
Influencer wants free upgrade: lifetime ban on flights at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was allegedly promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific via email, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was denied boarding - and is never to be allowed to fly Cathay again.
Spontaneous upgrades to business class -- that's what many passengers dream of. Sometimes they get lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a free change from economy class.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: A self-proclaimed influencer actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng has over 65,000 followers. On May 30, she flew from Taiwan to New York and returned on June 7.
On the flight, the staff refused Jaqueline an upgrade, despite her showing an email in which she allegedly offered an upgrade to Cathay Pacific. The letter is said to have been received by the influencer from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, however, accuses Jaqueline of faking the email.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight, and this time she reportedly showed the same email, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were skeptical, so they checked with the headquarters. And in fact, the employee who allegedly sent the mail denied contact with Jaqueline, which was confirmed by the mail system that didn't show up.
The airline officials at the airport cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and banned her from flying with Cathay Pacific for life, forcing her to buy a new ticket to Taiwan for $1,400.
The influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a consumer advocacy firm, because Cathay had reimbursed her for her original ticket, but Jaqueline was also demanding the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline doesn't submit the metadata of the email, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer committed fraud, she's banned from future flights, the airline's terms of service also say she doesn't have to pay for the new flight, and Jaqueline doesn't want to settle for that - and now she's hiring a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after report on Yemen ceasefire
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar on Friday afternoon, the latest time a barrel of North Sea oil, Brent, fell by $61.83, down 1.4 percent from the previous day, and the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The price slide was triggered by a report in the Wall Street Journal about a ceasefire in Yemen, with Saudi Arabia reportedly agreeing to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia halted five percent of global oil production in mid-September. Iran-allied Houthi rebels in the civil war-torn country of Yemen claimed responsibility for the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would ease political tensions in the region.
If a deal is actually reached, the focus could be on growth and demand concerns, Ole Hansen, head of the raw materials strategy department at Saxo Bank, told Bloomberg.
Oil prices have continued their downward trend of the past few days, with a week ago a barrel of WTI oil still costing almost $59 and Brent nearly $65.
Recently, Bloomberg reported, citing insiders, that oil repair work in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September has progressed faster than expected, with production volume having returned to eight million barrels per day and moving back toward the original volume.
Recently, there have been several press reports citing insiders reporting the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco's rapid progress in repairs, but raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some sign of a relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: more than two months after Iran's arrest and recent clearance, the British oil tanker Stena Impero is on its way out of port, with the crew preparing to leave while the ship is still at anchor, Erik Hånell, the ship's chief, told Swedish Radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the US announced that it would deploy missiles and troops to Saudi Arabia, the arch-enemy of Iran, and fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and Britain had pushed oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several senior administration officials have made an intensive effort to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in late July, an anonymous whistleblower said. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "concealed". Trump spoke of a "hack".
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon take place over the nuclear dispute, and that the meaning and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing the agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to KCNA.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the decisions of last year's summit, the North Korean foreign ministry adviser said, criticizing tightening US sanctions and joint military maneuvers by the US and South Korea, but hoping for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump to bring about a rapprochement.
Trump said on Monday that he would like to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he declares his readiness to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, the two then met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, where they agreed to revive the talks, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help clear mines
In a blue shell vest, British Prince Harry has symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a British Halo Trust camp near Dirico, he made the detonation circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive detonated. With a view to achieving the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later appealed to live television cameras: "I call on all countries whose names are on these weapons but who did not help clear the way to commit to help".
Pound under pressure - Interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of a rapid rate cut, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Speculation on a Bank of England (BoE) interest rate cut is rising against the pound sterling, which fell as much as 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sale was triggered by comments by central banker Michael Saunders, who suggested a rate cut even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as uncertainty would affect the UK economy for the foreseeable future.
Last week, the Bank of England already pointed to the burden on the economy from the Brexit hiccup without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement by October 31 if necessary.
More: The British prime minister has taken a big risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: further Russian manipulation exposed
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated, confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and now head of integrity at the World Athletics Federation.
In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the samples requested from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), and it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed. The WADA had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee allowed around 270 athletes of the country to compete under a neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio after individual testing, at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start.
Positive findings are lacking
The following September, WADA lifted the Rusada ban but requested access to the laboratory and the samples, which were supposed to provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in the state doping system, and to help punish athletes afterwards.
"We received the data nine months ago. We should check if the task force received the right data", David Howman said in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We found numerous discrepancies between the data the Wada received from a whistleblower and the data it received from the Russians in January". Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the IAAF's position: the IAAF is the only organization to maintain Russia's ban. At the Doha World Cup, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
Earlier this week, WADA had already exposed the manipulation and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks, and Russia is now threatening to block Rusada again and, in the worst case, to exclude it from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
