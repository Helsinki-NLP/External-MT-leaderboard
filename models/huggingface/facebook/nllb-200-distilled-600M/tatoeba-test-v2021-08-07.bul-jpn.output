I'd rather go for a walk than take the bus.

First, let's promise each other trust.
We were walking along the lake.
The decision to go or not is your responsibility.

I'm just dreaming of you!
I called you a while ago, but I didn't get an answer.
Lucy is probably marrying a pop singer.
I was drunk last night and went to bed without taking a bath.
I can safely say that with her current works her reputation will rise.

A strange man walked back and forth on the sidewalk.
I dreamed of you.
You and your sister left at the same time?
This tie fits your shirt.
This group of people came with us.

I've been working full time this week.
The typhoon destroyed many houses.
That's the house where Tom was born.
They were wet from the rain.
They were rescued by helicopter.
They speak Spanish.

Both are good teachers.
Tiranic governments often throw their political opponents in jail.
That's the truth.
That's my mom.
That's my mom.
It's just like a bean.
This is the job I chose.
What you said reminds me of a strange experience I had a few years ago.

This is a law, so everyone follows it.

This man is content with his destiny.
He was a wonderful man.
He was in a hurry to get on the bus.
He always leaves the house at seven.
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
He's over 40.
He's cold.
He's got a bad reputation.
He cried.
He closed the door.
He looked like he was once rich.
He looked like he was once rich.
He left the government.
He can't see with one eye.
He's not as impatient as his father.
He doesn't like to fly.
He doesn't smoke.
He never keeps his promises.
He would never return to his hometown.
He had no idea when to start.
He was nearing his end.
He lowered his head.
He's proud to have won the award.
He sat surrounded by children.
He thinks he has his own home.
He likes math, but I don't.
You need to get back soon.
You must judge for yourself.
She always comes without delay.
She's a doctor?
She's ambitious to succeed.
She can read even those difficult hieroglyphics.
She really looks sweet.
She can't be more than 20.
She woke up alone.
She has flaws, but I love her.
I'll be up early tomorrow.
I'll be up early tomorrow.
School is further from the station.
Fred is often late for an hour.
People don't like geniuses very often.
People are in this world not to get rich, but to be happy.

Can we go for a shoulder meal together?
London is now seven o'clock.
Jim is Canadian.
His native country is Germany.
