According to Taoba's guidelines, members are advised to either add sentences in their native language or translate from a language they understand to their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose naturally sounding sentences in their native language. When we write in a language other than their native language, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strange. Please translate a sentence only if you are sure what it means.
