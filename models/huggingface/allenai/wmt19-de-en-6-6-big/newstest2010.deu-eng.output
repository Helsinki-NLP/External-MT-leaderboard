Barack Obama is the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
The American President Barack Obama comes for 26 Hours to Oslo, Norway, to receive here as the fourth U.S. President in history, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He also receives the diploma, the medal and a cheque for 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
Tomorrow, the White House boss will arrive in the North West metropolis with his wife Michelle and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit culminates in the Obama prestige award ceremony.
He receives it as the fourth US president, but only as the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan when he takes over the prize.
The President does not want to evade this issue because he knows that he will accept the prize as a President who is currently waging war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops into Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The programme of events will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, with the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway.
From the outset, Obama was very cautious about the price.
He argued, for example, that he felt he didn ’ t quite deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that this is the price not only for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that for him this was an "invitation to action".
Conservationists accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz Police charged the chairman of the civic association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" with extortion.
In several cases, he filed appeals last year against some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said dieLeitmeritz ’ s police spokesperson, Alena Romova.
The chairman of Leitmeritz is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in prison and faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
Sorting of rubbish bins in Brno do not smell good
In Prague people can sort the packaging of drinks, in South Moravian towns you can find the sort of waste containers at every turn.
And in Brno?
There one would have to reserve a few minutes, in order to find the suitable garbage cans.
I do not want to say that the separation of waste in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that, even though we are the second largest city in the republic, the councillors do not pay enough attention to this problem.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Jungle League, not only because we citizens here are allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but mainly because of the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collection basket at the centre?
This is art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have so far found by chance is Moravian Square opposite the Beaten Goose.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues should not be annoyed, but that seems to me far too little.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also in other parts no honey lick.
Whole rows of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
For them it is too far away from the garbage cans.
I am not surprised.
I myself offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova road I did not see any litter bins in sight.
Fortunately I got to the right place when driving the tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn ’ t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league, which puts us in shame all over the republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the internet for a while.
According to the data of EKO, KOM, Brno is the worst place in the whole South Moravian region.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefit
After the Left Party, despite the government ’ s view, gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no money left in the budget for pensions, sick pay, and building savings.
But also not for the interest on public debt or for the international litigation.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists pushed through the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or sickness benefit. “This is only a postponement of the problems into the future, laying mines, ” Janota says.
The interest on the loans is always higher and higher, and you have to reimburse the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, how to get there, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party has now given more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
For pensions or sickness benefit, from whose account 1.8 billion disappeared, people must not be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state gets even more into debt - next year the state treasury will not only lack 163 billion, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and faster and, along with it, the costs and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate, and then it will no longer be enough to increase VAT only slightly or cut maternity benefits, as the government did in its counter-deficit, the Package.
Due to the transfer of funds to certain electoral groups, five billion euros will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly cheaper.
At most receive, which is also not free.
This means a delay or closure of thirty large buildings, and the creation of money in Europe is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money Solomonically - it attacks the CEZ ’ s share dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never secure and is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, the CEC invested 18 billion in the budget.
Every year, the dividends are used to pay off the environmental damage, liquidate the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
Furthermore, according to EU rules, this trick brings the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
But the carnival of revolution does not end there.
Almost three billion were cut in the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can manage without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
Janota makes it clear that if we lose an international legal dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the 'Treasury' project, which has already begun and is intended to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in that case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone in the future on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It ’ s enough to just press a button, and Windows Mobile turns into Android within a few seconds alternately.
The American company VMware wants to introduce exactly this possibility, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware pointed out in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and demonstrated for the first time a few days ago.
It will be launched on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working together with the European and American operators on the smartphones virtualization and the devices should come to the customer within the year 2012.
A lack of snow on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Scneelose slopes make not only the Giant Mountains worry inhabitants.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
Who wants the New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer saving and where the quality of the stay comes only second, can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindleruv Mlyn Hotel Owners offer for the New Year's Eve predominantly only weekly stays.
I think that they will try for a while to sell it, but then they will have to give in and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, estimated Jandura.
The Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are fewer free places here.
The first fourteen days in February are also sold well, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People wait to see if snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are covered with snow within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and slightly better than last year, it succeeds in occupying the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas, we only have a few free rooms.
There is a lot of interest in the Polish holidays in January, and in February the business will be going well, Karel Rada, the director of the best hotel in Pec, informed.
The Hotel Omnia next to the central car park in Janske Lazne is also occupied for 80 percent of New Year ’ s Eve stays.
On the other hand, half of the beds in the newest hotel in Janske Lazne remain free for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are currently about 60 percent.
February is a bit weaker now, but as soon as the snow comes, the interest in the Krkonoše Mountains increases, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains are waiting for more snow in the meantime.
On Thursday it should cool down and in case of rain it should be snow on the mountains.
But then there will be another warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Bureau in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is mother of wisdom
It is almost comical to see Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the wisest, repeat his predecessor ’ s strategy on the Afghanistan question, which he considered the most stupid.
When he finally sweated out his longingly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he copied it over the copy paper from the bush, Iraq, scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he has even used the name of the January 2007 Bush Declaration as the name of his own declaration, "New Way Forward," without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush idea of sending fresh contingents of troops to Iraq plagued by the civil war as an "irresponsible and, in its conclusions, disastrous decision".
Subsequent months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only one possible, and so far very successful, that the news about Iraq is no longer talked about at all.
This did nothing to improve Bush's reputation, because objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful starting point than was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
The military, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan ’ s Operation General Stanley McCristal, has again asked him to increase the contingent of troops, and he has harshly criticized the dithering White House shooters, despite the subordination habits.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but couldn ’ t come up with a better idea, so he betrayed the general by about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the promise for further 5.000, even if he originally expected at least 10.000.
Most problematic about Obama ’ s entire strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and complete the process within three years. Obama ’ s entire doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal war of recent years, Iraq ’ s society is relatively well-structured, and its leaders honor its values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by contra-indications - no one can be relied on and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only mock buildings, behind which the patriarchal master relations will continue to proliferate.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the complexity of the circumstances that further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "functioning state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation.
Obama ’ s time horizon of strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now on the verge of explosion.
Believe that the little soldiers who have broken out into the war cry about the "early homecoming" can create a miracle here, can only a truly romantic soul, who does not let himself be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, setting a date for troop withdrawal is sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take it as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans ’ willingness to engage in the skirmishes in Afghanistan is waning.
Europe ’ s politicians cannot and will not explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States will face a very difficult question as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during America ’ s post-Obama departure from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mark a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there is still three years to go before the presidential election, leaving enough time for him to adopt another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
The company has announced this, reacting to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of money, but they will not be allowed to sell them until five years from now.
Moreover, shares can be withdrawn from managers if they are overly risky.
Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort, according to Reuters, to combine the Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the wider direction in which it has to go, according to Douglas Elliott, a former JPMorgan banker.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism, having set aside nearly $17 billion in premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses in the course of this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars, according to the agency Reuters, despite the measure announced today.
With the onset of the financial crisis, the high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a whole series of countries.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-off tax of 50 per cent on bankers' bonuses exceeding £25,000.
Similar steps are being taken by France.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Today in Stockholm, five record women from the hands of the King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the specialist categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research in the chromosone area.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for elucidating the structure and function of the ribosome.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics to the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analyses of the economic report.
The only technical category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
This prize was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for their research in the fiber-optic field, and to George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD-in-chip invention that forms the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these prize-winners has received the diploma, Nobel medals and certificate of purchase of the prize.
That is ten million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are multiple winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy surrounding his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of the country that is waging two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning will receive the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about remaining in government because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form as it was released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis in public finances.
The president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
On Monday, Janota plans to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer about his remaining in office.
According to the Budget Act, which now Klaus receives for signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
In parliament, however, the Left Party voted on Wednesday on proposals to change the money and to increase the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of social democracy by secretly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has therefore arisen, which is why the question mark arises over the further work of the cabinet of officials Fischer, on the design of which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of austerity measures imposed by the fishermen ’ s government in the autumn, and which they believe should end the national debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget, stated today at the business breakfast that politicians have for a long time neglected the "serious problem", which is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
Only a strong government that could build on a broader consensus among political parties could bring about an improvement.
ODS president Mirek Topolanek pointed out that the budget is gruesome and that the government should consider its further existence.
ODS vice-chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial office as "strong sayings".
The CSSD ’ s chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek ’ s words that the budget deficit was horrific, that Topolanek ’ s former government had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in the new film by Clint Eastwood
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows the world much of the country, of its struggles and victories despite some criticisms that the lead role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, are portrayed in the life story of the American Oscar ’ s actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela to appear in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I play you, I must meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood Million Dollar Baby drama, was already the leader of the abolition of slavery movement, which in the end turned into a slave-owner, a fictional USA president, and also God in Evan Omnipotent, but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his activities in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "undefeated", and at the same time this is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film portrays a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, in order to unify the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that even after apartheid his people remain divided on race and economy.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team climbs up to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to put Mandela ’ s story on the big screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world leader were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake hands with Mandela.
I noticed that when I shake your hand, I take your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me it is important to have become another person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he met Pienaar in his house for the first time.
I remember when I rang the doorbell he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film I look much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one speaks also of prospects for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his evaluation in the following words: "This was a very good story, a very well executed film."
In the movie reviews on the web, pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Dissolved secret of light over Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
Over Norway a special light effect of unknown origin could be observed.
Just yesterday, the Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged that an intercontinental ballistic missile had been tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was again unsuccessful and the missile known as the "Bulava" type, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generals as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated on-site presence during the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but shines
This 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the atom "U" boat Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This missile type enables launch from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over the northern routes caused by an indefinite flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, from the very first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals have objected this time, claiming that it is not possible to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start took place without errors, the management of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and so it is further claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will carry up to ten hypersonic heads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself at the age of 51 again in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in trouble, and will probably compete in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, quoted the agency AP the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
By now, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect just one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other fellow players, listed fellow players Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice rink, he becomes, according to AP, the oldest Russian professional hockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe, aged fifty-one, played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
Dressed in the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles and triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice upset the Stanley Cup in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey team Sternzimmer.
Hyundai gives way to unions. All overtime will be cancelled
The management of the Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai agreed with the union to eliminate all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vanek.
But the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production schedule, which is a principle, so voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December for the reason that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
Employees will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift on 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement holidays on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek pointed out.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees are paid the fare and lunch.
Due to the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning issue regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to suspend all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk pointed out.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours practically every day after the eight-hour shift.
Upon signature of the agreement, the unions' willingness to strike will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the car factory and the trade unionists are to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfillment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the readiness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory came to a head last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management held against it that the coworkers must make the overtime to the adherence to the automobile, supply need.
In their Monday proclamation on strike, the trade unionists also demanded that the employees who interrupted production last Wednesday should not be subject to sanctions.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are demanding that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they are demanding payment of SEK 5,000 this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The serial production was started in the company in November last year.
By this September, around 80,000 vehicles had been produced here, and the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects' steeled 'HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have as much effect on common virus variants as one of the existing drugs.
AIDS has not yet been cured.
However, the combination of drugs can prolong the patient ’ s life and prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus, propagation, also leads to the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no medicines are effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with the virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances known as metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus replication in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance related problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new 'improved' compounds that have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viruses, the protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifarious cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon, and coupled by a metal, an atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and persistent virus
The HIV Protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV induced by the HIV inhibitor protease, no mature infectious virus particles would emerge.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the proliferation of the virus in the patient ’ s body, the scientists explain in the press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work, which was published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe entire series of compounds in which two pairs of the cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
Slightly weaker but more reliable
The effect of these anti-HIV protease substances has been tested in a test tube, including against their resistant variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarboranes on the usual enzyme “variant ” is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the used drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, make metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to Fischer, the defends himself
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "horrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence in his opinion.
The Prime Minister called the ODS statement "strong statements".
There is reportedly time for analysis.
Deputy ODS chair Petr Necas said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary leftists.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament approved the budget for 2010, but with the support of the Left Party, proposed amendments amounting to more than SEK 12 billion.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of the social democrats by secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Before the vote, ODS left the Chamber, thus complying with the wishes of the government, because even the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the provisional budget.
Disappointment and senselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the proposed amendments were accepted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government deal.
In doing so, he has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
According to Necas, to what extent Fischer is in favour of the further fight with the budget, the nominants of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had pushed through the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those concerning sickness benefits and pensions, or the amendment of the Service Law.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek emphasized in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, in a deputy capacity, there are people who are committed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to give up the fight against the deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left majority, which is currently in parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about this, and if it is topical, I will deal with it, said Defence Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Civic Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council in the afternoon.
ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the Civic Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not consider ourselves orphans, we are not small children, so he then reacted to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I did not realize that my voice would be missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months everything positive would be about the Bolshevization of parliament and the destruction of it, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railways), fewer trains will run for approximately the same fare.
From 13 December, the Czech Railways will terminate or restrict some less used fast and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The overall traffic volume will be reduced by 2% from the date of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares incl. basic fare and customer fare are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have several connections to the capital, and the railway will use Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer run to Bratislava.
Less fast trains will also run on the Prague – Pisek – České Budějovice route, and direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will generally be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the Hradec Kralove district, a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two overnight trains on the Prague - Tabor - České Budějovice line will also be lifted, and some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct route from Milovice to Prague, at the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth traffic route of the Esko suburban transport system, which can be opened thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Main Railway Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava, and trains to Sumperk / Jesenik will run at two-hour intervals.
With the Pendolino, passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year ’ s calculation for regional railways: increase of 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport; in total, the railroad will receive four billion crowns for the payment of the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, just like this year. Local trains will supply the districts, in total they will pay eight billion crowns next year, with the state paying three billion crowns.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has concluded a new ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railways praise the system, and perhaps that is another reason why they have failed to increase the price of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only apply to one-day CD Net network tickets and to eLiska low-priced Internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The eLiska price will depend then on the passed route, till now it was uniform for travel between any regional cities and cost 160 crowns.
Filipino militants arrest more than 50 people and release the children.
Today, militants kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This has been pointed out by the AFP agency, which originally only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living sign while fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to get the rest of the hostage out.
According to the AFP agency, the militants belong to the new People's Army (NPA), the fraction of weapons of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, martial law was imposed for the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Thirty journalists were among the victims of the 23 November massacre, which was linked to the election to the post of governor.
Suspected of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan Clans, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday they reopened the peace negotiations with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film "Invictus: the Undefeated" will be released in American cinemas. It is part of the life story of former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid was given to Morgan Freeman, who was supposedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting actor of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, is Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public become loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994 and in 1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it is being released in cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but, at the same time, the media are shaking the world public with frightening news about the rise of racial hatred and discrimination against the inhabitants by the ruling black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are generally positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
In his own words, Morgan Freeman is nevertheless proud of the new film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can - as they say - receive his energy, as he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it ’ s good that with this film we can remember Mandela ’ s personality and his message.
This is a South African story, but it concerns everyone, he added.
In the Rugby National Team Dress
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African champion of human rights during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman tries in the course of the film to bring together two racial and since year and day mutually demarcated groups of people and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he steps into the World Cup field in his role in the South African National Team Rugby, which South Africa won at that time.
Fourteen years ago, Mandela received great ovations, mostly from the white audience, for entering the lawn in the dress, which in South Africa is regarded almost as a sacred act, and won the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may succeed in uniting people into a single nation, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical, as recently revealed in an interview for LN by rugby rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Great Britain.
The championship will start on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny region, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny region.
Six units intervened in the fire, according to Lukas Marvan, spokesman of the Usti nad Labem fire department.
Originally the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later they changed their view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water-foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer, internal short circuit.
Nobody was injured, according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandatova, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the piping system.
The damage was estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, more exactly the damage will be quantified only after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened at the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
According to the spokesperson of CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted and the functionality of households, authorities and companies was not affected by the fire of the transformer station.
A.G. Ceps is active in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV transmission lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, which transmit the electrical energy to the distribution system and pipeline with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura files a criminal complaint for defamation against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today filing a criminal complaint for defamation against three socially democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice Region and the head of the Olomouc Region, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview with Radiojournal.
The lawsuit is related to the company ’ s effort to operate regional train services in several districts.
In the end, however, all regions signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, but we have only made the offer on the scale that was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were concluded last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this defamation of the society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the lawsuit to be a continuation of Jancura ’ s media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company and for himself.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do the same.
I assume that this matter, too, will make it clear that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport and using false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura already reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will indicate the adverse move of the districts.
He told the Radiojournal that he would suspend the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He specified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed with Czech Railways at the instigation of regional rail transport and did not tender the contract for 150 billion CZK.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, a member of the CSSD threatened him because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts.
The only threat was that if we did not do without it, we could also lose the bus licences.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who he is, I will not say his name, Jancura told Radiojournal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococci changes the usual from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But there are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination culminate.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August ’ s children
From January onwards, children born on 2 August last year and later can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccination dose.
Anyone who has already started vaccination last year or earlier will have to pay for further repeat vaccination themselves.
The first vaccination dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child ’ s life.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required to vaccinate the youngest children.
On the whole, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year on vaccination doses.
But you save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 euros per year on all vaccinations of children.
Mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota-package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear infection, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Due to pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children up to the age of 10 die per year according to an examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the obligation to vaccinate children against pneumococci has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
Starting from January this is to be paid by the insurances and voluntarily.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky, the head of the Nahlas civic association, mentioned that the obligatory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting the pneumococcal vaccine for a long time.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very happy that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded in achieving at least that.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman, Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, claim doctors.
The chairman of the Society of Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all the children had been vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations. "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents will have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is the first vaccination to be paid for by health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is connected with a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some deputies feared, however, that the insurance companies could so "take out the money from the health insurance company".
That is why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for insurance companies to pay for them.
According to the estimates, individual general practitioners will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
It won ’ t be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US-son of artist involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal 20 million dollars worth of paintings from his father ’ s museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with a trailer while inviting 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono "mountains.
81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for portraying figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior might have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "to enter the museum by any means necessary to take all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency reported that Frank Frazetta Senior denied having granted any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
The ministers defended the tax increases and expenditure stoppages announced in the preliminary budget report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer also came under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% cap on public pay for 2011.
Social security scandals
Trade unions have protested that low-wage earners will be punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned of imminent "problems".
The increase in social security - to about GBP 3 billion a year - has angered the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
IN FOCUS OF THE PROGRESS REPORT
A further 0.5% increase in social security from April 2011
This year, the economy contracted by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent of corporate tax increase for small businesses discarded
Tax concessions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
State pensions increase by 2.5%
The Treasury estimates that someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 a year poorer, and someone with an annual income of £40,000 will be £190 a year poorer, while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 was "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burden of the additional taxes would be borne by the 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and spending stops outlined would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big figures. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour ’ s predictions about future economic growth – affecting the size of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction – were challenged after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to contract by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the debt would be higher than previously estimated at £3 billion.
"Missed opportunity"
Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis", said the planned debt of £789 billion over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan, as they will repay and 'cynically' avoid difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place no later than June 2010.
“They didn ’ t say anything important about what they were going to do, ” said Philip Hammond, shadow finance minister.“ They had their chance to do that, and they let them pass. ”
"The important announcements are made after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which see deficit capping coming sooner and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained through the tax increases and spending stops will be used to cover next year's expenditure, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that some of the timing of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April - would expose the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the charge of capturing votes, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it most and that the situation be reviewed again in September 2010.
Hohler Etat
Although ministers have not released any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will be felt only in the medium term.
The accredited Institute of Tax Investigations said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer ’ s figures would mean a sharp drop in many areas, possibly in the future, including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said its head, Robert Chote.
"The major announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to the auditing firm Deloitte.
"This was just a hollow preliminary budget report. The markets recognize this."
FBI investigates "Arrests of US Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention of five reported US citizens suspected of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab Province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are accused of and the circumstances in which they are detained," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI ’ s spokeswoman, Katherine Schweit, said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it is indeed the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had been interested in the house before and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but said the US must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuses" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as poor as in the past 20 years.
The report details' patterns of abuse 'by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticism is politically motivated.
After the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences, and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC ’ s Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuses and ordered the closure of Kahrizak prison.
But since then there has been no tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook" networks and protesting against the election results.
"They repeatedly slapped me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... They threatened me with death and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half-unconscious, Amnesty said.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former detainee who said that he had been detained with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election riots and the government ’ s reactions to them, but according to Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been made public.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were detained to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
There was a short ski jump at the start of a 100-metre-long slope on the top of the slope in Brandon ’ s Hill ’ Park.
The student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in his fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glittering below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted to ban the construction of minarets, and widespread concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and thoughtful report on whether Muslims can be integrated - and integrated - into one of Europe ’ s avowedly most secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Warum die Franzosen keine Kopfftücher lieben" ("Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a controversial issue that divided and preoccupied the country over a decade and a half and whose effects can still be perceived today.
Bowen ’ s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it, "Islamic freedom".
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers, and intellectuals, none of whom have a familiar name, with the possible exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-born Swiss-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen mostly disagree with their Salafi counterparts - proponents of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia - who now have a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism may be compatible.
But an agreement requires give and take on both sides.
It questions the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite that so passionately guards the separation of church and state) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be treated more harshly than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn have had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes more a "tightening of the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say, "Yes, but not yet."
The most bleak view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that marks her melts at an alarming rate, taking with it life that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping, and fishing interests have moved into the newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers, and now writers in their wake.
In "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice"), Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Known for the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves in the polar bear hunt.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave fourteen-year-old ensign at sea who fought only with the butt of his musket is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at one performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the habitat of a wild adult. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore has become completely green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobiles are using powerful Inuit assault rifles to hunt down their prey.
Ironically, the ice will last the longest in the northern waters of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title: "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
But that is not because of a lack of explanations.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century gave an idea of the swirling of the pack ice for the first time.
During the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting ridges of underwater navigation.
Satellite surveys and the large-scale deployment of probes on icebergs are a useful addition, but much is still achieved by intrepid people camping out in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater streams compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to microscopic miracles in the ice, all are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected to happen between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... the We could be"
Marines were among the 6,000 to lay wreaths in Arlington
Corporal De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier whom he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have followed.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we might be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the funeral wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, established this tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington ’ s graveyard, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in New York ’ s Battery, Park, and at the memorial site for United Airlines, Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, Walmart ’ s Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a late professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped up in warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a target, as these are not as often visited as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The atmosphere was cheerful, children were playing and couples were holding hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the gray gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon attached to the top.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others leaned down to small black and white place cards that had been stuck in the damp mud for those whose gravestones were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son ’ s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the gravesite of Navy Corps Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
Nobody should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"When I have not been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractor of the U.S. government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government who sold mobile phones and notebooks to computers in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the US Department of International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the United States Interest Group in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything on charges of "endangering".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including easy protests and critical writings, carry a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been refused.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro brother ’ s communist administration in Cuba and the Obama administration, which sought a “slow ” rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States will provide something in return.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average salary of a government official is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, and they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a day's salary.
Internet access is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, spokesperson for US advocacy in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the handing over of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently published a tough report on freedom in Cuba entitled 'New Castro, same Cuba', an allusion to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the country's leader, replacing the sick elder brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are very often arrested, convicted and detained within one day.
He said that any solution was likely to be political, and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States at a time when both countries were moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said they hoped this case might help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters scanning the Internet for radicalised young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after locating them, because one of them had made consenting comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet, YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men when they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan ’ s tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan ’ s intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince Al Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA infiltration conspiracy.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist sanctuary.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men - who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI - highlights the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as porters, not letting in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American wannabe recruits are subjected to a special test by A Qaeda, analysts said.
Due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also regarded as immensely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access to in recent years, as the US intelligence community has become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate protection from the negotiators at the city ’ s Bella ’ s Congress Centre.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists detonated small explosive devices near some government buildings in the city center.
One day, when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered around the city holding banners reading 'There is no Planet B' and one in Spanish declaring 'Earth says' Enough '.
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the country of her mother ’ s birth, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to face due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the motivation why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to pass on the word and to appeal to the world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or had knives with them.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a bystander who refused to be named because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators dressed in black detonated several explosive devices near the Copenhagen Main Canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares, but were then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the congress centre, people gathered in front of TV screens to watch the whole afternoon demonstration.
But the protest does not seem to have reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China ’ s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something of which I was not even aware".
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, 'one can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people'.
Examination data show persistent breed gap
The math performance testimonials last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country ’ s best performing schools, the evidence shows that 4th and 8th graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures include is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of Washington DC ’ s white fourth-graders rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but their African-American peers only rose by three points, from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eight-graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also no more encouraging.
The gap separating fourth graders in white and black in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 points of scale (262 to 202).
And although the score achieved by children in both groups has increased in this period, the difference has barely diminished to 58 points.
Some of the district ’ s education advocates expressed concern last week that the results, which were celebrated by School Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students, who are already powerful children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit advocating educational equality in Washington DC.
I don ’ t jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said Washington Democratic councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a fourth grade daughter in Eaton ’ s primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee ’ s management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city ’ s middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, one always wants to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what frightens me is that we don ’ t spend nearly the time and energy that we would have to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson ’ s Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of primary and middle school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school careers and who are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and real-life experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP ’ s reported advances last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to ensure that the best measures benefit students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that NAEP ’ s findings highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, while continuing to provide the extra money and resources for the underperforming schools that are needed to narrow the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who is examining urban exam results.
The conventional cure is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, DC.
The objective could create political repercussions which work against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, wherever they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements in closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year for 185 days a year, which he sees as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects
The coach arrives at Gettysburg ’ s College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents have barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was found in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude, and that of the group ’ s other eight-graders who explore Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was that of an awe-inspiring visitor rather than an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who wanted to study medicine when the Führer announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told about the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The Pennsylvania college was the 7th the children attended on their three-day tour, and now they have fully grasped the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of US-born children of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to rise to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of this "second generation" of Hispanic Americans graduate from college - which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the US without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country ’ s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counselling programs also play an important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to get to college, especially if these efforts persist for a longer period of time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, a single measure at some point will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studied Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from pre-school through high school.
The federal program that Gracielas College has funded, the Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Going Up - and provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate from high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, with more than 60% going to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to persuade major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia, and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in renovating Iraq ’ s oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only win shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has lost out.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned off in June.
The thin-seeded representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of Iraq ’ s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news agency.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, underscored by massive coordinated bombardments on Tuesday, and political instability caused by the withdrawal of the US military, have probably dissuaded US oil companies from engaging more heavily in Iraq, which has the world ’ s third-largest proven oil reserves.
US firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks by not having to account to shareholders.
They were the only American companies to sign contracts with the Department.
Major US firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close ties with Iraq ’ s oil ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have been left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the big players in the world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its competitors and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
Companies pre-selected for bidding made bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda ’ s top planners apparently killed in Pakistan
A top al-Qaeda planner was reportedly killed this week in an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, US counter-terrorism officials reported Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist organization leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs allegedly killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in northern Waziristan Province on Tuesday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a type of drone used by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official from a Pakistani civilian intelligence service in Miran Shah said by telephone.
Local residents suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took all that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two US counter-terrorism officials cited vague evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planner of al-Qaeda, which led operations by terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, pointing to the delicate nature of US air strikes on Pakistani soil.
Given its central role, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from Al Qaeda ’ s top leaders and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali quickly rose to the Al Qaeda hierarchy and had excellent connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not lessen the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a tribal militant faction, and three other top activists.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has dropped from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary in the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN Envoy in Kabul Will Resign
The UN ’ s leading envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term of office clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-sponsored Afghan presidential election.
Oath of departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the US military withdrawal timetable, which is due to begin in 18 months, could induce other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We must accelerate the build-up of the Afghan security forces, thereby sending the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to assist in Afghanistan ’ s political transition.
The increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he was not stepping down from his office, but only fulfilling an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to search for a replacement, according to UN representatives.
The UN officials say that he has taken into account the Swedish / Italian Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN ’ s mission in Baghdad, and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Oath ’ s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country ’ s presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Oath rejected all the accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - which were fired - "undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said that he had recommended the appointment of a civilian leader to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase their confidence that their money was being spent properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN ’ s rules are such that since May, he said, I have been able to hire only one person.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because it has not participated in talks on its nuclear plans.
During a 7-day tour of the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq, downplaying the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to a soldier ’ s question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on my mind, if we have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, is the unpredictability of war."
The Obama administration is considering a sanction package aimed at Iran ’ s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions may also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian Government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the American government joined European leaders in warning that Iran would face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program did not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to curtail its nuclear program and forego a substantial portion of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the interim agreements -- in part, experts say, because Iran's leaders disagree about whether to commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community standing on some of the proposals that it had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they never were in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline of 31 December for Iran to respond to these proposals before proceeding with other options, including what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "stifling sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "groundless and unsubstantiated allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said that they were prepared to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to find an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq for meetings with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, especially over borders, property rights and the sharing of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent delays in US plans to reduce American troop numbers from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to allay Kurdish concerns about the imminent withdrawal of troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who told Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: "We will maintain your security, prosperity, and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A Change of Course in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters telling them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave."
They learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai suddenly began to change course due to the low birth rate and aging population this summer, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: "Absolutely not."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a HR manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the One Child policy in China, which spawned two generations of notoriously fat, warped single children affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis is looming in the country.
The average fertility rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, according to the UN.
Department of Population Issues fixed, while the number of population groups aged 60 and over is expected to increase explosively in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent by 2050, far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60 year-olds and older people accounted for nearly 22% of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Urban and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of fertile age must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of aging populations and alleviate the labor shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as industrialized countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
enshrined in the country ’ s 1978 constitution, China ’ s A Child is arguably the most controversial decree adopted by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of the country ’ s natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights officials have condemned abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to have an abortion.
Many couples also had sex selective abortions, creating an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials on behalf of the population have gradually weakened their stance on One Child Policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were only children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Department of Population Research at Beijing University, said that government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with one partner as their only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child have been replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and push through factsheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that there was an upswing in applications from couples who wanted a second child after the campaign was launched, the urban districts did not report any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the Caolu Township in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their best to their first one, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was legally allowed.
But, like many Chinese, they have only marginal government health and life insurance.
Without a social safety net, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the A Child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, they deprive us of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said that she only wanted a child because she was also an only child. “We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and don't really want to. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 year-old who owns a translation company, put it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with double careers, which reduces the birth rate, he said, it is about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The 20- to 39-year-old age group grew up watching their parents fight during the early days of China ’ s capitalism experiment, and they don ’ t want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
United Nations Group Drafts Emission Reduction Plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual recriminations -- has refocused on Friday with the publication of a document that sets out an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations having to bear the brunt of the burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, showed both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, as more than 100 world leaders will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, drafted by a specially created UN working group, remains silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options on key issues, including how advanced and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions, and what the upper limit of global temperature increase policymakers would support.
The process will be highly flexible, said John Coequyt, Senior Representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarised a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN climate change leader Yvo de Boer has called 'the big picture'.
It outlines the blueprint for a possible agreement whereby developed countries would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50-95% by 2050.
The European Community has also given a boost to Friday's talks by pledging to provide US $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from mastering floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Nevertheless, Friday brought the same verbal fireworks that dominated the talks last week.
American Climate Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations that call for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if not financed by developed countries.
That train announced that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than representatives of the Bush administration less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies standing up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his statement one hour after Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or was "highly irresponsible" about saying earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China cope with global warming.
With the future economic direction of the major world powers at stake, fault lines have opened up both within the developed world and between the developed and emerging economies.
The current battle is as much about saving individual economies as it is about saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to be more aggressive in holding countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will lead to a new economic hegemony, according to Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change advisor to Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The Small Island States Alliance, with 43 members, presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge, head of the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the Small Island States' offensive "puts political pressure on the whole political process", partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most outstanding issues had to be resolved before the arrival of government leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-level officials, such as India ’ s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China ’ s Vice Minister of State, got out of their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella ’ Center for meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to chart claims to be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people coming in and out of the Congress Center every day, guitar playing activists staging nightly shows mocking the countries they think are betraying and selling, and contract drafts being passed from hand to hand rather than e-mail -- is already challenging.
The intensity is only just building up: almost all the important ministers are now here and, from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global politics of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain ’ s first 225 km / h fast train redefines the feeling of the Monday
Monday morning at 5: 13, a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that is a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will travel from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras at 225 km / h and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lady Kelly Holmes will then go to Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, on board the first JAVELIN Commuter Service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect the UK to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains, connecting the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and changing planes and cars to trains would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle, and fears of environmental degradation could still put the brakes on Britain ’ s high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will present the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to The Times.
This will give him a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will have a five metre travel space and will pass through urban areas and places where environmental impacts are controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, northbound, high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y shape route, where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would run west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to cover the route from London to Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The designs would allow trains to travel at a speed of 400 km / h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned in such a way that trains of 400 metres length with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people could travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be in service on the line from London to Birmingham.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminal station would be needed in London to handle 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the limited space in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be upgraded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should continue or not, but the lengthy public deliberations and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be taken until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to change from high-speed lines to existing lines in the north of Birmingham, which would mean that the journey time between London and Scotland would continue to exceed three hours.
This is seen as a crucial sticking point to ensure a switch from aircraft to rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Pay for Home Mortgage for £75,000 in Conservative Orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative member of the House, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the costs of an orangery that he had built in his constituency home.
The party's prison spokesman, demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the House of Commons have to live on "meager rations," has increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak timber timber house on his second-home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons officials approved the amendments at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the House's expenditure. Duncan said last night that the amendments could not have been "cleaner or more comprehensible."
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control point of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a conservatory, which is referred to in the plans as the "orangery".
Neighbours described it as a "greenhouse for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased borrowing during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Standards and Privileges Committee.
The committee acquitted him last month after an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the collateral for a £271,406 (300,000 euros) mortgage from his London home to his constituency house, which he bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of parliament.
This week ’ s published documents show that by March last year Duncan was refunded about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncan ’ s interest rate on RBS ’ s mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the entire increase was used to finance the borrowing of £75,000.
The normal RBS stepless mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim £1,250 (€1,400) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live on "meager rations."
"Essentially, working for the state means living on lean rations and being treated like S * * * * * e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and claim a miniscule share from what is proper.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don't. "
The MP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked for spending in May, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before settling with the Fees Office that this "could be seen as an exaggerated demand."
As a protest, an activist dug a hole in Duncan ’ s lawn in the form of a pound mark after it became known that he had demanded £4,000 (€4,500) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequent Legg to increase value."
He added, "There is no debate about dodging and meandering or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and operates strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer. "
Come to all you believers to admire Brighton's Beach Cabins "Advent Calendar"
Brighton beach huts have found a new purpose in life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative group of churches that encourages spiritual discovery through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols as a theme for each December day.
The event started on the 1st of December and visitors could see the newest hut every day from 17: 30 to 18: 30 with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas carols selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", whereby the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman from the Chichester Diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go out to the people and have inspiring celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut, Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality. "
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organisers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the fringes of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which was supposed to conclude by Friday and which could take effect from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chair of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to this, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed all in black, smashed shop windows with cobblestones and hammers, according to an AFP journalist.
Anti-unrest police officers have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your assessment mainly members of the Black Bloc, this extremely violent splinter group that has already made a name for itself at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, have been arrested in eastern France in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without distinction," and pointed out that about a hundred of them "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and sitting position.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament to the Bella Centre, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the designated speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators came with buses and trains from the big European cities, but also many Asians, among them some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky-blue raincoats, have made their first appearance in the morning in Copenhagen, as they have responded to the call of the Friends of the Earth "to make blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for ecological guilt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist for the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can ’ t carry on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry up, watercourses where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has moved closer to environmental organizations.
José Bové MEP, the figure of the globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to combine "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are located that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has launched the demonstrations.
According to the organisers, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted bandanas in which they praised solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches were held by several hundred demonstrators to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "prank".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognised this separatist Georgian territory, which is pro-Russian, as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "coup".
Approximately 131,000 people were called upon to take part in the first election after the August 2008 Georgian war for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations will be closed at 17: 00 GMT.
The turnout was about 58% a few hours before the local elections were closed, according to the Abkhaz electoral commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili repents that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, according to his spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia that is legally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with the deaths of several thousands of people, Abkhazia wants to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54 year old historian, who claims to have elected Mr. Bagapch, explained.
She was one of the voters who went to vote at a polling station in a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes by the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch is to be seen at the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to supervise the election.
We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, particularly with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, in which Abkhazia cedes control of the railways to Russia for ten years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support either the current government or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this threshold, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people all over the world demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, ready for action at all times, arrested about 700 people on the fringes of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until December 18 welcomes delegates from 193 countries, who are looking for an agreement that is to take effect on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful procession marched towards the Bella Centre, where the negotiations were held.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the designated speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators dressed all in black, armed with bricks and hammers, began to crack windows, a AFP journalist said.
Anti-restlessness policemen have encircled you immediately and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made a name for themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested, a policeman sustained a cobblestone injury on his chin. Four vehicles were burning near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the police helicopters circled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators arriving by train or by car from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
But there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly wearing a sky blue raincoat, formed a first group in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," activist Lidy Nacpil told the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell ourselves any more: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses through which one can walk, which has never been the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP and globalisation critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen "to combine climate justice and social justice." Today, there is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world. "
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who appeal to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to global warming, has spurred demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organisers, some 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, the majority of them students, dressed in red with bandanas, advertised for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "network of 350", several hundred people joined forces, notably in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycées.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the national minister of education Luc Chatel stated that the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not taught obligatorily in the terminale (12th school year).
"Pupils in the 11th grade now have all four lessons per week and the same programme," confirms Mr Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but on the whole a concentration of "the best students".
"The economic, social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. He underlined: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical geographical education in the terminals on technical Lyceums."
On Saturday, an IFOP poll published by the Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) were critical of the government ’ s plan to cut the compulsory history and geography curriculum in Terminale S. Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized the plan, as did the left and some right-wing representatives.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their opinion is sacrificing the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that in Master 2 (M2) they undergo a subject-specific aptitude test at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admission test, during which their teaching skills are tested.
They also carry out internships during the year at the M2 and then teach as an internship teacher one year before the students.
He went on to say: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will get even more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He reconfirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the operation at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge faced by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday morning.
According to an AFP journalist, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and make them want to know more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of the day, on the sidelines of the conference. The name of this event comes from the name that the students gave to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Among the experts, about twenty participants were chosen, also according to their charisma," he specifies.
"You can talk for hours on end about global warming, but the key goals can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of AFP, who gave a free speech in front of some 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he said, hoping that the audience would see that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot at these conferences will be available online on the school ’ s website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment: angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the penitentiary unions called for a general day of action to ensure that the bonuses and overtime paid until January for budgetary reasons are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Penitentiary Union ("FO" Penitentiary Workers' Union ") called on employees who are not on duty to demonstrate in front of the penitentiary on Tuesday morning and block it in order to draw attention to the" theft of what they are entitled to ".
The 3rd Penitentiary Union ("CGT" Pénitentiaire ") called for" a strong mobilization in the various prisons ", on which the non-payment of the overtime, night and Sunday and holiday surcharges incurred in October is branded as" shameful and unacceptable ".
The first union of penitentiary officers, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP / UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice said that overtime in 2009 had increased sharply and not all of it was budgeted for, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As reported by the Ministry of Justice in the evening, Michele Alliot and Marie sent a letter to the penal unions, guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts made by the staff to keep our penal system functioning and to modernise it", the Minister of Justice informs in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the penitentiary to take immediate measures to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen as a result of a lack of evaluation of overtime, is not repeated in the future," added Ms Alliot.
The December wage is thus meagre, except for the management personnel, which will benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP / UNSA, for which the "budgetary constraints" must be used.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional union FO in Marseille revolted, announcing that it would boycott "all meetings and conscriptions" until new orders were issued.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and public holidays when the hours of October are still not paid in December. That also applies to their overtime," threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich oneself with the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the CGT, Bordeaux trade union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, notes the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama thinks he ’ s always handing out better gifts than he gets himself.
American President Barack Obama, who will be spending Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he is always handing out better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special broadcast on Sunday evening on channel ABC, the President and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be there.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too", Michelle Obama affirms, adding that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you nice gifts last year," she teases the president.
"So please," he implored her mischievously and pointed to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an informal atmosphere with the well-known television presenter whom Barack Obama had supported so vehemently during his election campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts that they had loved most as children.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and a basketball brought from Kenya at Christmas by his father, whom he rarely saw.
"I remember when my father once visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
"It was only much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her doll ´ s house.
"I didn't know at all how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll's house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL confirms that he was put into an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles because of considerable "injuries" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into an artificial coma in order to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was operated on again at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, after American doctors found "damage caused by the operation on a herniated disc" that he had suffered on November 26 in Paris, according to his production company in Paris, which added that the damage required another operation.
The singer's production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical report would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
Only after 48 hours did one have a little more certainty about the patient ’ s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the AFP ’ s request, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "it is clear from certain sources" that after his first operation in Paris "no drainage was made".
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The surgery, which was planned over several days, was carried out by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments on RTL.
After the surgery of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted to Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley" at the moment. However, he assured that one "need not worry" about making the rock musician, because he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him that it was nonsense to sit on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation, it wouldn't work like that," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer ’ s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday “reacted well to the antibiotics ” and that“ the infection was contained ”.
Mr. Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer ’ s wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, concern for the singer ’ s health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's astonishment, Johnny Hallyday was said to have had a "small intestinal cancer", which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as planned as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to deny a new admission to the hospital.
Euro ’ 2009 / Short Course: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the World Swimming Championships 2009 won an international title over his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 on the short course in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m layers of the men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to break the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two regal swimming distances, 50 m in freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman held his own in 20.53 sec,. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can always believe in bigger things and in this case I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which first started in the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer didn ’ t manage to improve his personal best of 400m freestyle (3: 32.77), but with the second best time in his career (3: 34.55), he prevailed over the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn ’ t set a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job. ”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
USA: Grave slab at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
According to the art dealer Sotheby's, a Roman tombstone that appeared at the hands of the French writer Emile Zola was estimated at 1.5 million US dollars over its value on Thursday.
This slab is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the 3rd century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, Vice President for Auction of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most so far," the Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble piece by Emile Zola goes back far.
The record was at home for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While browsing the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon ܢ Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been foiled
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to its home territory to be incompatible, following his refusal by the coup to accept the government.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place that night, everything seems to indicate at the moment that there is disagreement over the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of M. Zelaya ’ s transfer, has returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and to apply for political asylum abroad under escort.
The overthrown president, however, refused to do so, as he wanted to return to Mexico as the most welcome incumbent head of state.
The coup d'état "has suffered a new failure, trying to persuade me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to resign", M. Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has spoken frequently since the beginning of the political crisis, which has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled two and a half months ago to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa, striking some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the coup government, told the Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I am not seeking asylum at all in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, based in Caracas.
He stressed that he would only undertake a possible departure from Honduras as President of the Honduran people.
The rumors of M. Zelaya ’ s departure had mobilized the deposed president ’ s supporters on Wednesday, who had gone to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had stepped up its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup ’ s stance.
This, he assessed, revealed the marginal nature of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day of the referendum he organized to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had suddenly returned from his exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he is imprisoned for treason of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup has succeeded President Roberto Micheletti to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognised by the United States during the disputed election, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against M. Zelaya ’ s return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street on the rise, the US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the American trade balance show a price recovery of the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, dominated by technology, rose from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was valued at 1,102.35 points, at 0.58% (6.40 points).
There is good news from various sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-full glasses", so it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States ’ trade deficit fell 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October relative to September.
By contrast, analysts had expected deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In turn, unemployment reports in the United States have risen over the past week, against all expectations, and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "fell to the lowest point of the year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds for 10 years has risen to 3.482% compared to the 3.432% on Tuesday night, and the profitability of bonds for 30 years to 4.492% compared to the 4.408% on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle out "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundred partisans in Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners who had gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and also foiled another rally, on the basis of which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
Some forty "ladies in white", wives or close relatives of political prisoners, were booed on the street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were walking into the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" the empowered partisans shouted at the dissidents with a raised fist.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place the previous evening in Havana, in which there were neither injuries nor arrests.
In the suburb of Vedado in Havana, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents who also took part in Thursday ’ s demonstration in view of International Human Rights Day were temporarily arrested by plainclothes policemen, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents, booed off by the government partisans, to enter civilian vehicles by force.
Temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized rally for the purpose of "asking for the release of all political prisoners", the number of which, according to the dissidents' list, contains about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom have so far been imprisoned.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionaries."
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insane kills octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy
A two-knife-armed lunatic killed an 80-year-old man in downtown Clichy at peak business hours on Friday afternoon and injured five others.
According to initial information from the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the 80-year-old with two knives for reasons previously unknown in or in front of a pharmacy on the Jean Jaures Boulevard and this, accordingly, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, died in hospital as a result of his injuries, according to an official of the Alliance police syndicate.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has unbuttoned a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, approximately in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were hospitalised with serious injuries, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured man is in mortal danger because, according to police sources, vital organs have apparently been affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "state of shock" according to a police source.
The armed man, who, according to police reports, seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, was said to have escaped immediately onto the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter severely.
The scenario remained in the dark that evening.
He had been armed with two butcher ’ s knives, which he wore crossed behind his back, explained on-site Arnaud Pressé, a person in charge of the Alliance syndicate in the Upper Seine region.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried to tame the lunatic, according to the reports of AFP.
I've seen a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They didn ’ t make it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde has raided him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Jean Jaures Boulevard, at number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were stabbed to death, according to police sources.
The event took place in one of Clichy ’ s main arteries, the Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby approached me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put him in first aid, and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, to AFP.
Five minutes later a second, about thirty-year-old person came, injured by cuts.
Rescue forces of the state police finally arrested the man, who did not carry any identification documents with him.
The prosecution of Nanterre has commissioned the district department of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been questioned.
A police source does not exclude that he is admitted to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six policemen were required to tame him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been deported.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" like "all mentally confused people of this kind, in whom the forces are released during the course of the day".
USA: Polanski ’ s lawyer calls again for the suspension of the prosecution
The lawyer of French-speaking Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) for the prosecution of his client, who is currently on trial in Switzerland for a moral offence committed more than 30 years ago, to be dropped.
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", has denounced gross procedural errors before three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California at the time of the hearing in 1977.
I demand pardon on the spot, M. Hummel said, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "made one run cold".
According to him, Judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed matters with a public prosecutor before he made his verdict, who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved a penitentiary -- which amounted to a serious procedural violation.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" by the public prosecutor David Wells.
At the end of September, M. Wells finally declared that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary film.
Should the Court refuse to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel will ask for the conduct of a trial which would enable him to present the evidence supporting his argument.
The indictment, for its part, has reiterated the evidence already presented at first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the cancellation of the charges against the accused cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the USA in 1978, even before the announcement of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
Since then he has not travelled to the USA.
Deputy Attorney of Los Angeles County Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message on this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that flight is a way out?, asks Mrs. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favour and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to make their decision known - even pointed out "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one to ask for the suspension of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the annulment of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client could no longer bear being molested by any resurgence of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this trial was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough ".
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the orders of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street is held back by the rise of the dollar and closes without a price tag.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday, in a market torn between better indicators than those in the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at the time of closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 65.67 points to 10,471.50, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31.
The enlarged Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is fairly quiet," stated Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain so until the end of the year."
The tendency was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than foreseen, which "have contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the recovery of the economy", summarized the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than planned.
American consumer confidence also improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan ’ s index forecast.
However, the indices have been slowed by a new rise in the dollar, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, "pushing down sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The 10-year Treasury bond ’ s yield rose by 3.540% on Wednesday night from 3.482%, and the 30-year bond ’ s yield rose to 4.497% from 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World re-election in South Africa
After a one-month round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to make their dream come true: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is being held for the second time in a row in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were awarded Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their stay in Africa.
This was a veritable whirlpool of amusements.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and made a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday at 5 pm (3 pm Central European Time).
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova underlined in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, and to emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, every woman ’ s dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but this is not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a big smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates parade in traditional costumes and not to forget, in bathing suits.
The show will be presented by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, Michelle McLean, the former beauty queen of South Africa, and Steve Douglas, responsible for the Miss World Executive Committee.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with an unsurpassable warmth and pride, says Julia Morley, Chairwoman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, have made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time have tasted by bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them, was quite extraordinary.
Not common for a head of state, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Your best memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the football World Cup in June 2010, a way of the country to promote this event a little more.
I am dealing with people I would probably never be able to approach otherwise.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi, promised enthusiastically.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been hospitalized there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press at the exit from the plane in which he arrived shortly after 13: 00 local time (21: 00 CET) from Paris.
The singer ’ s son, who seemed relaxed, assured him that he would go to Cedars Sinai Hospital “as soon as possible, ” where Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday for a bacterial infection following a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles in order to relieve his severe pain and to be able to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars ’ s Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was hospitalized on Monday for a bacterial infection following a disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation during the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last intervention.
On Friday morning, his wife Laeticia attended a school event in the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, according to an AFP photographer.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié Hospital in Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer heavily burdened neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely indignant, Mr. Camus said.
I have heard that a court case may be initiated, he said.
According to Jean-Claude Camus, Johnny Hallyday "traveled far too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke to this doctor personally on the phone, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me greatly, as I myself had already undergone two intervertebral disc operations, he added.
Shortly before, he reported on RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic milieu.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a haematoma after a cerebral hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor of dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations, not to mention tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the medical association, described him as "a man without scruples", who has to answer "regularly" to the board of directors and is "anything but recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention was "perfect" and the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been running since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is obvious that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr. Camus explained.
The Union for French Democracy (UDF) becomes energetic and asks the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The coalition of parties overseen by François Bayrou's MoDem party reacted violently on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party that was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and called on him, under the threat of legal action, not to use it on any more documents.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over the UDF emblem, believing that François Bayrou is not worthy of defending this political legacy after holding out his hand to the left.
The Defense Minister, whose party partner is the UMP, incidentally wanted to reiterate this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To underline his efforts, he had received the support of the Member of Parliament Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who is claiming ownership of the trademark UDF, since he was the first to apply for this trademark at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle" in 2004.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by François Bayrous' friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and set a deadline for the minister and the deputy to stop using this seal and to transfer to them the property rights of the trademark under threat of legal prosecution.
You have made numerous declarations in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to adopt the UDF ’ s Siegelzu +, the alliance of parties wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, of the MoDem party, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You also thought you had the right to have the name of this movement + Nouveau centre +, the slogan + of today ’ s UDF +, printed on your political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, said the UDF office and requested the party NC to "immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all material as well as from (its) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was "required to transfer the proprietary rights of the trademark to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will take legal action against you to ensure compliance with the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the undersigned warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978, recalling that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the "UMP" party.
According to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party has no right to use the Union pour la démocratie française (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the creation of a bureau to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the Secretariat continues, 'by the time he applied for the trade name, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years' but of the UMP.
He is making scandalous and fraudulent use of the lack of the UDF acronym to do this for himself.
Furthermore, you remind us that this ruthlessness is well on the way to turning into a criminal offence, and you ironise the NC's strategy: 'It seems to us more dignified, in politics as well as in life, to make a name for oneself, instead of trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently appropriating a name in which one has no legal entitlements'.
Liliane Bettencourt affair: François Banier convicted of exploiting weakness
The Nanterre Court of Justice decided on Friday to judge the artist François Banier to see whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has taken advantage of a weak moment in the life of the octogenarian to steal part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is well known for his star photos, will have to stand trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years ’ imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair, worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Trial Chamber also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions presented by the Prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which you clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think it will undergo these investigations.
I will talk to her, said Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for Françoise Bettencourt ’ s lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court ’ s decision.
This is excellent news (...) The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who must be protected, he affirmed.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt ’ s only daughter has filed a criminal complaint against Francois Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited her mother ’ s weakness for years in order to obtain a total of one billion euros in donations in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-time friend.
Although the Court of First Instance would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt, the lawyers ’ plaidoyers led to a major family debacle on Friday.
Liliane Bettencourt ’ s lawyer referred to three letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) sent by her client to her notary public, in which she wrote that she mistrusted Françoise Bettencourt ’ s husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I have been writing to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Since her marriage, I have never been able to speak to Françoise ".
The Public Prosecutor ’ s Office of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the plaintiff did not have the right to react in this way, mainly because a guardian judge has rejected her request to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother in recent days.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full legal capacity, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in her place, "affirmed the representative of the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court of First Instance has now decided to render a judgment after the admissibility trial of Mme Bettencourt in the case of Meyers.
The Manager Revolution or the End of Early Strategic Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in terms of its employees, said the position of the company vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution: It is intended for staff to join "values" to impose the best, as it used to be on the consumer, products designed by the technicians at the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolutions has given the strategies of conquering the local markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separated factors customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the forefront of a much larger phenomenon affecting employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, particularly those of R & D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique) "requires from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it claims from the employees a commitment that the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would consist of placing employees at the centre of the company ’ s concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The Very Limited Benefits of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in management practice?
I am afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I was able to observe that, in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure is finally beginning to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplistic idea of human behavior.
Emerging from the great engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behavioral theory recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and suggesting that it is possible to use the "levers" (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey by Ipsos, published in Le Figaro.fr, encourages managers to adopt an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a fundamental protocol into any thought or practice of control: for the wage-earners, the commitment to the company is possible only if it appears clearly as a means to realize a part of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
At the moment, only studies from multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivating employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa, which, through their perceived image of the company, allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create fertile soil favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who derided the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the president ’ s speech this time, following the example of Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the face of the right-wing Republican Party in USA Today, adding that she herself had raised the issue of "sometimes necessary" war in her recent memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the President had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, exulted the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, this speech was completely perceived as historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see a "President of the Left" reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that they "are not free and could not hand over a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan", as "he always does", he spoke "like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live as in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and for whose protection they do not do much", said Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rightists, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, called the speech on the National Review Online website "boring, lofty, and inspirational."
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about Barack Obama ’ s defense of recourse to the armed forces.
If the war is packaged under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can simply be justified, he warns.
However, the press of the centrist left continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that Obama was awarded the Nobel Prize prematurely, called the speech "a monumental work" even to a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "provides a roadmap for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian daily writes enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Truck drivers: three marathons for an agreement that will secure supplies for Christmas
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening, which puts an end to the strike order and the impending severe shortage of supplies at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, State Secretary Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted company early Friday morning in the hope of swiftly signing the agreement late in the morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers ’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours elapsed between the beginning of the meeting at 11: 00 a.m. and the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was not signed until 6: 00 p.m.
The conflict "would have caused the companies a lot of damage" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not very much, but we start small", said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some unruly people who are not satisfied with the agreement", he adds.
TLF ’ s president, Philippe Grillot, spoke of a “good deal, ” though“ it was difficult to accommodate these wage increases in the face of international competition. ”
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low wage brackets and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage brackets.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for the workers", said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible, in particular, to tackle the thirteenth month salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau pointed out that "the decrease of taxes on employers amounting to 100 million euros" was the subject of an amendment proposed by the government to the draft law of rectified finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for an "identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to the organisation and then, if it is extended by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time", assured Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The federation FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade", because the 100 million euro "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to offend goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, complains Unostra.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "threatens to dig a grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest rapid transit rail network in France for the Paris metropolitan area and the Île De-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the unions and the leadership of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration) keeps the strikers waiting with their demands for wage surcharges.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, no trains were running between 10: 00 and 20: 00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation), only one of two trains was operational, and outside the central route only one of four trains was operational.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which has 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is making efforts to link up the major stores".
The RER A line runs through the Paris conurbation from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint Germain and Nanterre, as well as Boissy and Saint Léger and Marne, and La Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran on schedule during rush hour, and almost none during off-peak hours.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the platforms, as the residents of Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint Germain and Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), said in Boissy ’ s Saint-Léger (Valley of Marne) that he had “got up an hour and a half earlier to get to work in time ”.
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of travellers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at the station of Saint-Lazare.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line, or in the direction of Cergy, are scheduled to arrive at or depart from St Lazare station in order to provide access to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday again general meetings of the strikers took place, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the top management on Friday afternoon.
RER ’ s executive suggested the specific elaboration of a protocol for the RER A line covering all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long overdue wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself parenthesized its own wage proposals, stressing that the top management “is unable to solve a problem, whereas this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF. ”
The RATP made it clear that a new "comprehensive review of working conditions" meeting was foreseen for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers went to the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership that had hitherto rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calm of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the RER B line following a preliminary announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The federations demand a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and they also deplore the deterioration of working conditions on this route, where millions of travellers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services and Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country ’ s pro-Kurdish main party, a decision that was immediately followed by furious demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the country ’ s south-east and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç told the press four days after the decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to declare the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party ’ s leaders, including its chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political scene for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk and the confiscation of the party ’ s property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
Before the verdict, the leaders of the party said that parliamentarians would rather leave parliament than meet like non-party parliamentarians.
The decision follows a case initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and numerous other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the PKK ’ s legal political showcase.
The party claims to have "no connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court interferes with the government, which is seeking to accommodate the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to dry up the Kurds ’ support for the PKK and put an end to the conflicts.
DTP leaders affirm that a resolution could lead to a renewed outbreak of tension in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan ’ s detention conditions in recent weeks have led to clashes with the police.
Since the court ’ s announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP ’ s premises in the city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
The law enforcement forces used tear gas grenades and water cannons when demonstrators began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court ’ s decision would “deepen despair even further. ”
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, editor's note) question by banning a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose on principle the closure of the parties.
That does not solve the problems ", so energy minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government", said the political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"One can obviously prepare oneself for a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK confessed to an attack in which three days earlier seven soldiers were killed in the north of Turkey. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wishes for.
Not because he wants to bully the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
But so that its employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, this could be the case for the first time at the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called "A" routes will be driven by large scattering vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads and thoroughfares such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
In addition, fire-brigade approach roads, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and distances with incline, like the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES begins at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with damp salt, which adheres better.
That is why FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the routes are free until the rush hour starts".
It becomes difficult when it snows at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then nobody is willing to make room for the spreaders".
Only then, if it does not continue to snow, are feeder and access roads, including the Council on Axe Road.
The last priority are side roads and secondary roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o ’ clock in the morning, the FES foot soldiers set out to clear danger points and crossings as a matter of priority.
The FES usually cannot take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 pm to 4: 30 am, says Brauburger.
Since there is smoothness on these quickly, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary this is called also by the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two meter long and 1.5 meter tall animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, report Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science from Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time lay in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the kinship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began excavating the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some of the bones as new species.
During the excavation they gathered the remains of five individuals.
Finds confirm theories of Dino ’ s early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, mostly you only find single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to current doctrine, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, however, which is why the assignment of these original dinosaurs is usually controversial.
The experts, for example, discuss when the lizards split into their three most important lines of evolution: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "longnecks" and their relatives, and the herbivorous ornithischia, which included the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags similar to those of the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge Sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight construction, the common ancestor of both groups probably had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America over all continents, which at that time still formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangea.
This is supported by the fact that the team found the remains of two other, not very closely related theropods together with Tawa hallae.
The researchers argue that the three cannot come from a common, immigrant ancestor.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion a distorted picture could arise, because in South America simply a lot of primitive dino-fossils have been preserved, while on other continents hardly anything is to be found.
It is still a mystery how the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare tribe of reptiles to the dominant agricultural animals of the Middle Ages.
During the Triassic the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the pterosaurs and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border of the Triassic to the Jurassic died out.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to bloom that had also developed in the Triassic and had been in the shadows ever since: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the occupied casino at Frankfurt ’ s Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Presidency.
University President Werner Müller has had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the education strike vacated last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, according to the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commando."
The eviction was an "unacceptable encroachment" on the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the contents.
The presidium had evaded the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage to property, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one ’ s own future, says the State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse ’ s Minister of Science, Eva Kühne, has defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, said it in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener federal state parliament.
We have understanding for the protest, but no understanding for vandalism, so the CDU to state parliament member Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw things differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of grappling with the arguments and demands of the students, they left.
The left has tabled a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a closely guarded site for secret armament research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the community with its 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is known as the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Already since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts to the Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Zelenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for Closer Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Vice-Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Zelenograd headed the Russian delegation and Edwin Schwarz, Head of Planning for Frankfurt, signed the contract.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a matter of continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to secure contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute for Electronic Engineering, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The Commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for armament research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For those who support the project, it is simply 'the new heart of Europe'.
That's right. S21 is much more than lowering a railway station, it's more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden Württemberg's capital into a hopeless chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminal stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be traffic engineering fossils of the 19th century, which looked like brake blocks of modern rail traffic, as it once took an enormous amount of time to rear-span locomotives.
Drive in, stop briefly, drive on - that's how it should be.
And that is why the terminus stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway along the trans-European mainline between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being tackled, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian cities to implement the lowering.
However, terminal stations no longer have an entry and exit problem since there are modern reversing trains with locomotives and driving wagons at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 together with the new ICE line to Ulm is now tackled.
State and local politicians have pushed it through.
The railway is taking part, not least because the risks of the largest infrastructure are borne by the individual project of the Republic of Taxpayers and not by the state corporations.
The project is still reasonably justifiable in terms of urban development.
New urban space is being created, which - if one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger traffic, to which - typically 80's - huge growth was attributed.
At that time, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first of all focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport by lorry.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to steep gradients.
Even more seriously, S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be budded in the Swabian region.
That is the official number.
Experts believe 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be lacking at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the Ministry of Transport ’ s list.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the track has been built at slow motion.
It would be urgently necessary to press here correctly on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine Valley line becomes a bottleneck for international freight traffic: right in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews judgment to the airport
The state government has left open in the state parliament of Wiesbaden whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight prohibition in revision.
The CDU / FDP Coalition has commissioned experts to examine the more than 400 pages of comprehensive Administrative Court of Appeal verdict, said Economics Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The Administrative Court of Appeal in Kassel had on those days written reasons, that the country in the case of the planned construction of the northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport must re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as it plans the federal state government, is not compatible with the legally required protection of the population against nocturnal flight noise.
The Coalition must decide by 4 January whether to appeal the verdict.
The opposition criticised this postponement and urged the representatives of the government not to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD ’ s leader, Torsten Schaefer, called on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises made before the election to ban night flights. Otherwise, this was to be regarded as a "breach of word".
It is damn hard to keep one ’ s word, said Green Party leader Tarek Al Rather Wazir in allusion to the FDP ’ s election slogan, “We keep our word. ”
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of shepherd "Gümbel, the state government is trying to come with" distortion of law and trick "but still to their night flights.
A thorough legal examination takes time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The statements made by his group on the ban on night flights were never the same as those made by the opposition.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-ridden US mega-banks are shedding their government shackles.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund totalling 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
Citigroup is also planning to reimburse state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
In doing so, the institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with accepting the money, such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had borrowed a good $19 billion from investors via convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken out of her own coffers, which were, among other things, well filled by sales of sections.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: the cash injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to exempt itself from its liabilities to the state.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A citizen group spokesman refused to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Rapid election
After all, everything went faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after ZDF ’ s executive board had forced the current chief editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Yesterday evening, the committee wanted to vote on the staffing.
Peter Frey, head of ZDF ’ s Berlin capital studio, was a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, so as not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it must have played a role not to further damage ZDF ’ s artistic director Markus Schächter if this proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender ’ s dismissal was a bitter defeat for Schächter, but an expected one.
For the majority of the Union in the Administrative Council had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender would not be confirmed in office.
The resistance against the editor-in-chief had organized the hessian Prime Minister Roland cook.
With the argument that under Brender the news broadcasts of the Second Channel of German Television had lost ratings, he rejected a further term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Recently, as many as 35 constitutional lawyers had interfered in the debate, assessing Koch ’ s actions as unconstitutional.
It did not help.
The person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
Afterwards he worked for the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the today ’ s journal.
Subsequent stations: Personal assistant to the editor-in-chief from 1988 to 1990; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of ZDF's "Foreign Policy"; since then head of ZDF's "Hauptstadtstudio".
After Brender was voted out of office on Wednesday, the Greens announced a constitutional complaint, which was still voted journalist of the year by the trade magazine Medium Magazin.
Last week, Kurt Beck, the Rhineland Minister-President of the Palatinate, declared that the Länder should amend the ZDF ’ s treaty in such a way that the intendant ’ s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an extract of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF.
Brenders prospective successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board with a clever move - by severely criticizing the board immediately after Brender's defeat.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the Board of Directors was able to elect him without suspecting that it was a partisan.
In party arithmetic Frey is in any case assigned to the left liberals.
Study is clearing up
Partial success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder finally initiated the process on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and University Rectors' Conferences, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor's and Master's degrees.
In future, students should be able to cope with their studies.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the burden of the examination: in principle, each study module should end with only one examination.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable level" is to be ensured.
Politicians and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural guidelines for bachelor and master programmes more flexible.
Furthermore, there should be no country regulations deviating from them.
Less testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of education and the university, rectors, have had the winged word of better studentability in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, it has been filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to partially drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually ends with only one examination", it says in a 30 pages of paper, which is to partially re-regulate the admission of study courses.
With the "significant reduction of the examination burden", explained the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "development is to be stopped, which considerably impaired the studentability."
In addition, "studentability" is to be "the decisive criterion" for design in the future.
Modules such as contents are "strictly to be checked" whether "unnecessary restrictions of the students in the choice of
events ".
The students would have "claim to receive room for manoeuvre, which makes self-initiative possible and promotes".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the review of existing ones.
These have to be "reaccredited" every five years - which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies in Germany are responsible for this, and they are subject to the accreditation council set up by the Länder.
In October, the ministers of education and cultural affairs' emphatically 'called on the countries to influence the agencies in such a way that the amount of material was not too great and the audit regime not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is the only state to have pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The money will be used primarily to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen student counselling and examination and international offices.
State and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
In early 2010, the government intends to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into parliament.
According to this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The design of studies should be more flexible, and the recognition of certificates of performance at other universities should be guaranteed and access to the master's degree programme facilitated.
By the end of next year, all degree programmes in the country are to be checked for their studentability.
The government and the opposition had once again argued on Thursday about the conditions for studying in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso-University Groups demanded that the formation of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
After the educational strikes at the latest now also the studying should have a say as concerning “a word ”.
The future academics received support from the President of the German Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
For the Education and Science Trade Union (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough overall: They call for a legal entitlement that allows every graduate with a Bachelor ’ s degree access to a postgraduate master ’ s course.
On the other hand, the federal states must ensure that sufficient Master ’ s degree places with the best possible study conditions are available for the current generation of Bachelor ’ s students tomorrow, according to Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Executive Board.
Countries need to recruit significantly more lecturers.
The ministers of education, however, did not comment on a freer access to the master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering into Germany and out of it is beautiful, almost no control "... is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses in disturbing language fragments the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children ’ s book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt Lectures on Poetry at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he caused a considerable non-literary sensation at a conference in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorting mirrors of its security files".
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read a declaration in which he admitted to his collaboration as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate before Romanian German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present, Söllner was awarded the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun stealthily, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "someone who has not resisted enough intimidation attempts by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary engagement with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that reveals the abysses and baseness of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
To the best of our knowledge, Werner Söllner is not only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
After Söllner ’ s confession, literary scholar Michael Markel said that IM Walter had played a role in his Securitate file and referred to the IM Walter ’ s positive influence.
According to Markel, he "knocked him out" on all the difficult points for him at the time.
He felt a moral need to make this remark.
Söllner ’ s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
According to Müller, Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate informants, as Herta Müller had already written in July, after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The persons concerned, so one may assume, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew, which clear name was hidden behind the pseudonym Sorin, Voicu and evenly also Walter.
In contrast to the in this country meanwhile very reliable review of the Stasi files, the handling of the legacies of the Securitate is still very diffuse.
Systematic information has been obstructed and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Processing of Securitate Records (CNSAS) corresponding to the Birthl authorities was only founded in 1999, but since then the process of issuing the files has been rather slow.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the management of files.
After the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, a former head of the Securitate in Timisoara disparaged the prize-winner in an interview that showed that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great.
She had a psychosis, after all, she had only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
To be sure, as is so often the case with concealed guilt, the Söllner case raises unavoidable questions.
Why only now? Whom has been harmed? The prudent reaction of the listeners to Söllner ’ s confession gives reason to hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a thirst for knowledge rather than by apportioning blame and shame.
It is more than a footnote on the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if a well-dressed sales representative had just arrived from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier, stepped into a called C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive bald head was driven because of the still strange city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with luck, the 55 year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or let ’ s get started.
In the words of the only three days before committed Swiss: "We have reached the second round", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by the success: It will be a brutally hard fight against the relegation."
The "much more important task" was to come on Sunday.
Then it is, to repeat in Mainz the king classes of the league, performance in everyday life.
And to eliminate the weaknesses that have been revealed again after the quick three goals by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Draw
The second round of the Champions League (16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy at the brilliant debut of Babbel ’ s successor thus remained muted.
Not only with the supposed savior, who had conveyed the unsettled Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, operational readiness and joy in playing.
I approached the players and told them to reflect on their strengths, and urged them to be more courageous, explained Seelenklempner Gross the recipe for success, which sounded so simple, but had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has kindled a certain magic, admitted Babbel ’ s supporter Jens Lehmann, “when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that one would not have thought possible. ”
And Sami Khedira, who became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamic after weeks of injury-break, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new supervisor's way of working: "He is a man who takes action and demands discipline.
That ’ s what we need in the current situation. ”
It was obviously lacking under Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not out of the woods yet, warns Horst Heldt
But above all, VfB Stuttgart needs consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were wary of overestimating the victory against a weakened and completely overchallenged defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen the bad awakening came, Khedira pointed out.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season has been achieved, the other is still far away.
We are not out of the woods yet.
The fact that Heldt did not feel like celebrating his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was due to the weekend ’ s events, which were brought to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann ’ s harsh criticism.
The had shown the board leadership weakness and had decided to change coaches under pressure of pubescent fans.
Lehmann also saw his day off after the games as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "shaped by pure egoism", Heldt wedged back and announced consequences for the netminder.
They will probably no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
But at least they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work by the detached coaching team the playfully and combative strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share in the success", said Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Championship in Heavyweight Fight
Heated duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title by version of the WBC.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Box World Heavyweight Champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat U.S. American Kevin Johnson unanimously on points on Saturday night in Bern (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice World Champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately it did not work out with the K.o., which all expected.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to admit defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson suffered his first defeat in the 24th round.
In front of 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 metre Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left-wing leading hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, withdrew again and again from the hits of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and just tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger caused quite a stir before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can do nothing right".
While weighing, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "in order to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth Victory after Klitschko's Comeback
Klitschko remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of absence, he beat the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and retrieved "his" WBC "belt, which he had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in his defence of the title.
In this fight I only got one blow and I am in very good physical shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is World Champion of WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA, however, is worn by the Briton David Haye, after he dethroned the 2.13-metre Nikolai Valuyev in November.
Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko earlier this summer.
Allegedly, the latter ’ s promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in London ’ s Wembley stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand enlightenment from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl wissenschaftliche Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has accused a deliberate deception.
The minister said to the deadly bombardment on two tank trucks of September “knowingly the untruth ”, said Greens in the group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the German television news program“ Tagesschau ”.
This is commonly called: He has lied.
The order to kill was issued in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read, said Trittin.
On Friday it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped vices, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air raid requested by the German commander, Colonel Klein.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak to the Bundestag immediately and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Greens' colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not influence concrete Bundeswehr operations in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the Ministry ’ s presentation of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert were also raised.
According to information from SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have informed correctly and completely about the background of the tank truck.
Officially, they had denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
From the circle of the two top officials, however, it was reported that they had even drawn the attention of the Ministry of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document from commanding Colonel Klein and a field infantry report.
In the meantime, Wichert is said to have asked for clarification in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Bundestag ’ s Committee of Inquiry, which intends to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Traumwelten
Some see pictures in an awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are blurring, not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are free to indulge in the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
In the modern Western world, however, those who experience dream-like states, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted, at least as eccentrics.
But such images and voices do not only arise in mentally ill people or in drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes cause the boundaries between dream, delusion, and reality to blur.
Dreamlike altered states of waking consciousness can occur in different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Even if triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age, prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - above all dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no more power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in an awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 that "there is a great similarity between insanity and dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, illusions of such a state".
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a cartoon character.
His body is two-dimensional and colourful.
Gravity has no more power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devils with blood-red, distorted grimaces, dotting their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, ties them to a loop and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs onto a loudspeaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The noose comes off.
That should be a lesson for you, the voices scream in a choir that tears apart the drums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychosis, the last one was 2 years ago, the first one nearly 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective, paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is manic-depressed, he takes medicine against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, he says, I have experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and psychiatric hospitals treat it as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, patients are usually no longer able to distinguish between the inner and outer worlds; they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of size, relationships or persecution.
Listening to voices is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person is no longer able to separate important from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, and consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of what is happening, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he falls into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by events, as in a dream, and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are usually not able to match reality, the illusions are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
To have experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in dreams, says Fuchs, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, remains fundamentally intact."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Exactly why our brain beats anomalies is still a mystery to researchers.
States of emergency can cause any person to lose touch with reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disturbance of the neural system comes about, which furthermore does not manifest itself for many years at first.
Also environmental influences play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis, if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also cause psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether illusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of standpoint.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations belong to the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderlines or depression, this often includes diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer ’ s and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory contents that are usually retained.
They occur when areas of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are overactive or inhibited too little; when our brain is running hot or when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also attraction, stress, lovesickness or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to one third of respondents stated that they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old. She lives in a small town in Mecklenburg, Western Pomerania, and attends grammar school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren ’ t the images and voices.
In the interval it can happen that a lanky boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it answers it, classmates look at it in surprise - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spooky daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn ’ t dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
This is a pleasant feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the subject matter, because the teacher is introducing a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations audibly and visibly on the blackboard for everyone else.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, are created in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends do not tell her about it, they would consider her crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she has known that she is not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from irritation, he will most likely have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect that the brain is then underoccupied and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Daddy, since she can think, is not her biological father.
Since the same areas of the brain that process real impressions and sounds are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, it is difficult for sufferers like Sarah K. to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is reflected there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain appear so real. "
Kasten also values nocturnal dream images as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their illusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our too much consciousness-centered world, imaginary experience is unfortunately usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and head physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Florence ’ s Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative elements - delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt ’ s Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience, a special form of dream-like altered wakefulness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed, quasi-dreams, which the experiencing person believes to be real and which he cannot differentiate from the waking state in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis, patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by loss of himself and the world, for example through permanent, total incapacity to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt, Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between dream and hallucination.
Since coping with a situation is not possible in reality, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is visualized in the imagination.
An intensive form of creating meaning and giving meaning in an intolerable situation, which enables us humans their own creative ability not to get lost in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid adventures in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue operation for the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to motionlessness in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bed-ridden old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
In the early Middle Ages, he lived among nobles who produced intoxicants from blood.
Abducted by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, surfs with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
It is completely absorbed in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast to that, the memories from mental journeys are still very clear to me after years and in minor details.
More clearly and intensively even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience goes beyond the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are in waking.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new head of publishing Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term Hubert Burda wants to hand his company over to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to be wholly owned by the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
As a precaution, we have regulated the details of this.
The question whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
Also the question whether they are able to do so.
You cannot appoint 7 500 staff if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will be retiring from the Board of Directors in January, and appointed Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury division, responsibility for corporate assets was added, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left the company, responsibility for direct marketing, foreign business, printing and finance was added.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The naming of Kallen also served to "bridge 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, said Burda.
With a view to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family-owned businesses are not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families that were infected by an addiction to capital, which had completely speculated itself out of existence and thought that this would enable them to become a major player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never had dreams of world power", according to Burda.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was a jumper, nor do I want to play in the world league with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
That, at least, is what El Corte Inglés has in mind, having recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m ² in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around personal care.
In the wellness area, located on the eighth floor, you will find prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which use laser hair removal; Spaxión, with relaxation areas and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out for its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m ², which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for the hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers, offering them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen, which is located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to do your workouts properly.
The manager of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) is completely sufficient to exercise the muscles of the body.
And if, after exercising your body, you want to stop by the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi company has a room where treatments are offered in a personalized way to regain the beauty, shine and health of your hair.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and to bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points to consider.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. We can only advise against it.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE" office.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE" office (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility through the management, coordination, subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is currently being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise opinions and measures in the fields concerned.
This is an attempt to promote the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also involved in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among others, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates with a view to promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts "a horizon of calm" for the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter.
During the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero reiterated the steps taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would now have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," the President said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the General Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 car manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn have generated investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments were intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the measures taken by the government to stimulate demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which are being applied in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased in November "by 40 percent".
Classic vehicles on 20,000 square meters

Mazda3 in Stop: Eco-Friendly Sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and start system for the Mazda3 model, which has been christened the i ’ Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out by its good grades in the overall picture.
Finishing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the system...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good support.
Furthermore, the play of the steering wheel is excellent.
When looking at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, one can see that Mazda, with a multitude of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colours red and blue, is in line with the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore it can be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of the German automobiles, above all from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more comfort than ever before so that four adults can comfortably travel by car.
To all of this comes a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearshift.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out for its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year, should consider this stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gearshift and its low consumption, even if at Mazda especially the diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the Sportive model selected for the test ride is special because it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
Among the standard equipment, the most noteworthy is the Lane Change Assist (RVM), which eliminates the blind spot, as well as the controls for traction and stability, cruise control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and the chrome-plated 17 "wheels.
As if that wasn ’ t enough, this version also includes the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: among other elements, the adaptive Bixenon and the BOSE sound system with a CD loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i ’ Stop ’ version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which ranges from 21,770 euros for the Luxury model to 23,270 euros for the tried and tested Sportive model.
In return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving pleasure.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shone more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your E ’ mails without the possibility to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when Time magazine voted it one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is nevertheless of particular interest to young people.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing its success, the company has launched two new devices: one that is only for Twitter, and the other with a life-long free service for data, unlike the Peek, where you have to pay six times more.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and therefore its third version.
It has the same limitations as its American counterpart, but it comes as a surprise.
The monthly phone maintenance fee, about 12 Euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read your emails as soon as you cross the border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with Flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone operators already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you need a PhD in physics and good glasses to be able to read all the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always gone unheeded.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon even though it does not have Wifi / WLAN) can offer these types of tariffs means that telephone providers must slowly but surely rethink and begin to consider various ways in which they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without contract and without hook.
This is a web-enabled device and you only pay for it once, when you buy it, not month after month.
And that is exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase possibility with lifelong Internet access as already offered by Peek in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
Rather, I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
When Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at what was, without doubt, his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric - and she wore something large-sized embroidered or a necklace.
It even went so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and in Oslo a patterned velvet dress.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a similiar model, but golden.
The hair style was also different every time: the hair was put up as a wreath on this occasion, with the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fertility and careers of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged between 15 and 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market restricted by motherhood.
The study reveals that there are big differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of job they do.
Those who do not do any other work outside the home, who only work part-time or do not have a permanent contract of employment are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with permanent employment, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"On average, women in the 35-49 age group who have a permanent job do not have their first child until 3.7 years after they have moved in, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women with a permanent job who have taken longer to do so and who have moved in and have had their first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major impact on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of conception ”, explains CSIC ’ s researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account when women get married and when they have their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the higher the first child.
This difference could also be seen in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between the ages of 35 and 49, depending on whether they only have a lower secondary education or a higher education, became mothers for the first time on average at 25.1 or 32.1.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
Whereas the main graduation women get married before their first permanent employment and have their first child, the middle or high school graduates do it the other way around and first look for a permanent job and then get married and then have their first child, states Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its universally envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress in "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous figurehead, as she did before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last who were allowed to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's acting colleague in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important part to play in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They had all appeared on that occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which was voted the best model of this year.
The Poker Game of Manuel Vicent
In "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente), Manuel Vicent presents around thirty x-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a foreseeable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a sobriety to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares neither horror nor enlightenment.
Besides being a delightful read, this book is also a moving invitation to read and re-read.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "By reading his pages I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, exactly as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: Joy in contrast to disastrous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humour, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was so captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were combined with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in going to heaven in the detour of perdition."
About James Joyce: "Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 m summits in the world literature, you have to climb up the north face, the wall, where the best climbers try again and again. "
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange idiot.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain greatness. "
About Louis, Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane cry that was shouted out from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo echoed in his literary manner until deep into the night of the 20th century. This he did on a journey, on which he fled from himself and implored posterity with a speech full of violence before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: my God, I ask you to do everything in your power to stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'Sleep after exertion, / after the thunderstorm the harbour, / rest after the war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spied on her between the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
Not a single other case is known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was far greater than her madness. "
About Pío Baroja: "What else was Martín Santos doing than trying to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not introduce Baroja to Faulkner ’ s weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could place himself on this pedestal? "
Fig Aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our district in the town of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid that we have brought from the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they gave him two kicks and injured him severely.
Our indignation cannot be expressed in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun should be with a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was naturally carried out on a leash.
Then there is the attack of suffocation that a woman who went for a leisurely walk had when she wanted to reprimand these people for the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he might do the same with a woman, a child, an older man, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident happened in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog howled all day long.
Of course, we have made a complaint in a nearby police station, but we have serious doubts as to whether this will achieve anything at all and, in order to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would just like to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation at what has happened has led us to denounce this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people to find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, an animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of the use of helmets, as this is the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes far beyond the design and manufacture of products that become safer and safer every day" and reiterated that they also contribute to this goal every day with other educational and informative activities.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will initially distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" for the company, and precisely because, as a manufacturer of tyres for two wheeled vehicles, they always feel obliged to ensure that one of their main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
Sales of light trucks are rising again
After almost two years, the vans market finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac Manufacturers Association and the Ganvam Automobile Dealers Association.
However, these good figures are currently to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference figures used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase last month, total approvals for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all the vehicles that make up the small van market: car derivatives, pick ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans / chassis.
Furthermore, there are still the same thunderclouds in the sky, which affect demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of the sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third party financing.
In addition to these restrictions, which are the consequence of the credit institutions losing money, other factors must be included, such as the increase in the rate of unemployment or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama, unlike cars, financial support for the purchase of a 2000E plan vehicle has done little to help.
This plan, however, is not only intended for private individuals, but also for self-employed people and small businesses who want to buy a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with CO2 emissions that must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam again reminded us that it was essential for the state to pay special attention to these small lorries and, of course, to industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The car dealer association predicts a similar year for the year 2010 as the one just past, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as is currently happening with the ESP stability control system, the emergency braking systems must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already compulsory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, and the remaining vehicles are subject to a waiting period until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but due to their functioning, these braking systems can also help prevent many rear-end collisions.
The task of the Emergency Brake Assist is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects based on the braking power applied to the brake pedal by the driver.
However, this system does not apply this pressure to the end.
According to a study commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to press the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked at full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus the braking distance covered by a car during braking.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 pedestrian deaths could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking system.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents involving personal injury is expected to be prevented - once the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems became popular.
The vehicle is then equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the Brake Assist will apply maximum pressure on the brakes to minimise the damage.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While the workforce at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American car manufacturer points out that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected side to give its approval on every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, may be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
In contrast, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab within the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper-compatible sports car, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
If an agreement is not reached with any of these buyers, GM may sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it has not been sold by then will continue.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their newest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to make it 80 kilograms lighter, which means it now weighs only 1,275 kilograms.
In order to achieve this, the first thing they did was to dispense with the automatic hinged roof, which was replaced by a manual canopy roof, which alone saved 21 kilograms; thanks to the aluminum doors used on this model, such as those of the GT3, another 15 "disappear"; by removing the air conditioning, another 13; in addition, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 liters, which saved another 7 kilograms; by installing sporty Bacquet, seats were reduced by another 12; and with the light 19 inches, five rims were saved again.
In addition, the CDR 30 audio system was not used, and the door handles were replaced with fabric handles to reduce the weight by six kilos.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6 standard manual transmissions, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain roads that were really very winding.
With its driving behavior one can give it only the note impeccably.
But the reduction of his weight did not mean that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
Rather the opposite is the case: for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model, but at the same time it gives you a feeling of great safety in corners, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, to brake, to recover and then to get everything out of his engine again...
He does everything you tell him to do. The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering system, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is very good and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used in the Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is inconceivably brutal, whether from standing or when accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car coped well with the potholes.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track, even though we found ice at dawn and rolling chippings in the morning on some of these corners.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, which is probably rather rare and it contains much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster S.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl '
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stubbornness as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many unusual players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent victory with 82 and 91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra, thus coming first in his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria could replace the significant losses of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 evaluated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blue-red team, which was at the top of the scoreboard right from the start.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come onto the field with well warmed up wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from Álava decided to play an inside game of Barac and the game of Eliyahu, who was received with whistles and applause on his return to the team, which is his home, to extend their advantage until the break (34, 43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of Splitter indicated that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, the game was far from over, despite the clear advantage during the break, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into play.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellow" turning of the rudder (50 "49").
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic ’ s team, injured but far from dead, had to prepare a few plays with accuracy in order to catch their breath again and one of them suddenly had the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who, with three nearly three times in a row and with the support of English and Ribas, ensured that a reassuring distance of (54 “67 ”) was displayed on the scoreboard, which the host was able to embellish with (57“ 67 ”) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavesen were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60, 75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they had honestly deserved in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team back strength by three points off the line (70, 77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was put off the pitch because of fouls, Ivanovic ’ s team did not give up, defending well and although the Israelis caught up at the last minute (80, 85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being challenged
In Greece, Unicaja vociferously lost to Olympiacos and had to give up the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, in a game characterized by the losses of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The team from Malaga was neither afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were able to dream. An aggressive defense and three successive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12: 18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the first team, Unicaja, even though the local team, with an interior match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, managed to get 22 in the 13th minute and 20 in their favour, the minute in which the two Americans Beverley and Williams almost got into a brawl due to an action and both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to get warm and its superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-made mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear marks on Unicaja.
Among their indoor players and Lithuanian teammate Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their advantage to 44 in the 19th minute.
It was impossible to catch up
The third quarter of the game was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which despite its 19 losses proved to be superior and even managed to make up for the difference of the game held in Malaga with 66 and 48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the lead within the group to sway.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many losses and the departure of Robert Archibald, a Scotsman injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31st Minute thanks to the lead and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis back to some hope of 66. 57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, because the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujčić managed to raise the basket gap to 81, 62 in the 37th minute, and Unicaja was beaten and had to give up the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn from your profile on Facebook?
Thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with the most listings of properties, jobs and cars in Spain, users of Facebook can now find out their salary, which they should earn on the basis of their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates users' salaries on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can use a form on Facebook to enter their profession, work experience, age and the city where they work.
Just a week after the application became available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish employee felt "poorly paid" on average, explains Albert Ribera, who is responsible for the Trovit product, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the least paid according to the data that Trovit owns through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a lorry driver has a net annual salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with a net annual salary of 11,592 euros, followed by that of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months have been those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to visit its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date he must have left the Embassy where he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he will have to leave on January 27th, as his mandate will expire on that day and he will have to find a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the November 29 elections (which were won by Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to find refuge in Brazil this week.
This failed, however, due to Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most enticing days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant sentiment in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets was to settle the debt by buying assets directly, and indirectly to give liquidity a free hand at interest rates moving around zero, so that banks could buy assets for settlement.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are all but finished and, without calling into question their heterodox liquidity policies, are beginning to throw a spanner in the works, as BCE nac has already demonstrated with its annual auction to be held next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premia.
Stock market volatility and differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
Governments have been forced to nationalize private risks, and public debt is rising again.
Quality is back in the game, and the US, Japan, and Germany are the preferred refuge for investors, which in turn increases the eurozone countries ’ differences with Germany.
Spain has hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's, threatening a new downward revision of Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, a certain insecurity does not harm to silence the defenders of moral hazard, who had once again tried to raise awareness among the leaders of world economic policy of what they had caused, because they had slowed down the devastating effects that the restriction on credit led to the loss of jobs, when they should have decided on a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirates in order to restore power in the Emirates, and developments in Greece have been foreseen before.
A government that hides the national debt, elections and a new government that is pulling in the same direction.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to bail out Hungary earlier this year from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments, thereby allowing a euro member country to default on its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account in the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, facing an episode of normalisation of the risk premiums, after a few excesses to excessive amounts, this would now be within the expected limits.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as sovereign-debt differences increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences were to narrow and Spanish populations were to increase further, this would be a specific Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local advanced indicators force a majority of the market research institutes to bring forward their scenarios for recovery and revise their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which are once again coming up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long life span, despite warnings.
Once again it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "caution when driving" is the order of the day.
Linked branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply for the next two decades is currently being debated.
After his appearance, which was followed by Rafael Villaseca, chairman of Gas Natural, Galán gave the press some key points about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the president of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest €50 billion by 2020 and another €60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international networks.
From 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, provided of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, certainly did not want to say anything against this law on how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the exact opposite of all policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly being taken, despite some" individual "measures, as the president of Iberdrola has described them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should already be taken now, because it will take time and a stable remuneration framework needs to be created to address them.
Ferrovial gets "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for ground services at airports, Swiss Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage services at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, on which no figures have yet been published, is set to last five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castilla La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of cooperation aimed at creating an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to study energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where it is already present as an energy and water company.
The construction in question is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city council wants to have the construction completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration decided in favour of a public-private collaboration (PPP is the English acronym) in order to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and management of toll booths.
In anticipation of the bids presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Acciona team will be challenged by the Northern Direct consortium, made up of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure, and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and final consortium to be shortlisted is called LBRJV, made up of the capital of Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public works.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction and privatization, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as access is only possible through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy that the companies mentioned, Hochtief or Bilfinger, have followed, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only entered this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona counts on this geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill farm (192 MW) in Victoria and is leading the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the Adelaide Desalination Plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure sectors.
The underground toll road, promoted by the City of Brisbane ’ s Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link, is designed to connect the Western Highway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass (see map) through tunnels over a distance of 5 kilometres, the largest measure used to reduce congestion on the Brisbane roads.
The roadmap issued by the municipality provides for the award of contracts for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll route is expected to open up to traffic in the last few months of 2014, construction is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the funding.
For Hochtief Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia continues to award significant contracts to Hochtief, which signed a 154 million contract with the government yesterday.
The subsidiary ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre optic cables through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company busy for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey King George Tower project in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction has not yet started and Hochtief has received 129 million for this project.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC awarded contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for €64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has secured the construction of a 2.1 kilometre long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The contract was awarded to the company only a few days after it won the contract for the extension of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) to the tune of EUR 130 million.
In this way Alpine is strengthening its experience in tunnelling.
Construction work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore receives promotional budget from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
In this contract there is also the possibility for two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies, which presented sch to this competition announced by Renfe, from which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible in the last three years for the advertisement.
From now on Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty of 63 million for France Télécom for slowing down its competitors.
The regulatory authority for competition in France has imposed a fine of €63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone operator has reduced competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the verge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday has even been increased because the competition watchdog believes that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone operators and has opened an application trading site on the Internet to increase the revenue from transactions not derived from the telephone connection.
In principle, this Orange website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for this to be made available to other countries, such as Spain.
The match at the Champions League has earned Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the beginning.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of income for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have accumulated 476.4 million since then, which puts them in third and fifth place among the football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) that have participated in this event since its inception in the 1992 / 1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona benefited from this distribution.
The white club is the third in Europe to make the most money by participating and, after AC Milan, the only one to win the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 took fifth place.
The list is headed by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also made the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
Even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third among the countries that could make money from the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, unlike four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money distribution procedure used by UEFA.
This year, the organisation, which is chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this sum, UEFA has earmarked 413.1 million in fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the preliminary qualification round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million for their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 Euros for each game they played.
There is also a bonus for winning (€800,000) and a draw (€400,000 per team); the clubs that have reached the quarterfinals will each receive €3 million; the four that have reached the quarterfinals will receive €3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second who receives 5.2 million.
A football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça on the other hand earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, this is compounded by the EUR 337.8 million in variable payments.
This money is distributed in proportion to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 allocated places.
Last year ’ s champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place finishers and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday leaked details of its offer to purchase shares, with which it intends to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage which, due to the number of shares, does not force them to submit a public tender (opa).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos concluded with shares 1.85 Euro, therefore Nueva Rumasa the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jeréz group gives shareholders 15 days to notify their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV affirmed that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the authority.
In the event of a deal, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
The Jesús brothers and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as Head of Internal Audit in an attempt to remain on the sidelines of potential sales offers and the legal wrangles of his former managers.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, directly answerable to the Chairman of the Group.
This is anything but free of polemics because the company is involved in a legal battle on suspicion of diverting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar loan, the former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public procurement notice of Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this call for tenders after it had been proven that the conditions complied with the law in force and that, therefore, the content of the explanatory supplement submitted, following the amendments of last 2 December, could be considered 'sufficient'.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of €7.65 per share, which in turn represents 8.95% of the share capital of €6,142,786 in shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been permanently invested, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender, and the price of which has been determined by Federico Paternina in accordance with the law in force.
New vehicle evaluation programmes
In these days of bad weather and accidents not only the motor vehicles deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an expert must assess the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
No single accident is the same, and calculating the cost of the parts and hours worked can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The manual calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand it is a matter of minutes with the support of the newest informatics tools.
That is why almost 100% of surveyors use this type of system.
Accident and repair evaluation service providers collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera Group, is the market leader; 80% of all appraisals are carried out with its products.
The other two companies competing with each other in the evaluation and report preparation market are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, the company works with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of whom provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is steadily increasing, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car enters the market, the companies start their work.
It is a laborious task, because each of the thousands and thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, an "intelligent" graphic image is created of each model, on which one can "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, the work can be completed in a week, if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, 99.2% of cars sold in Spain are fully informed by Audatex.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information on Porsche models, but not on Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the number of vehicles on the roads, it is over 99%.
In order to carry out documentation work and to produce databases, Audatex has eight centres located all over the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specialises in specific trademarks.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million Euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap or calculating the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this service in Spain but in the United States.
When reviewing the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the type of support that it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for according to the intended use, i.e. for each report.
It will be most expensive for customers who rarely use it a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, a vehicle and the equipment it ran off the assembly line can be fully identified solely on the basis of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is a service on the Internet that is open to the specialist market and can be used for vehicles that have been declared a total loss.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses, or obtaining information on brand and model deviations.
For example, it can be used to investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop because of a breakdown or how many of them were involved in a serious accident over a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for appraisers and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for damage, breakdown and maintenance of vehicles.
GT ’ s Expert Guidance Guide is a reference product on the market.
They cooperate with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 the turnover amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and set up in Spain in 1979.

Auction of Accident Cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accidental vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company ’ s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value creation, with the opportunity to gain access to a vast international market.
This appraisal and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
This platform was created 1996 in Germany and administers more than 650.000 operations in completely Europe, 500,000 of it in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 appraisers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been unregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be re-registered, even if they have been registered out after difficult administrative procedures.
Estimate of the workshop in four steps
Audatex makes sure that the user receives an estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, preparation and preparation of an estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older specialists, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer technologies.
The database comprises 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with internet connection.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hours, surcharges or discounts and then have the estimate printed and passed on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop oriented one does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
At present, Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, because with it, for example, you can select a door and then turn the image completely over to look at the inside.
