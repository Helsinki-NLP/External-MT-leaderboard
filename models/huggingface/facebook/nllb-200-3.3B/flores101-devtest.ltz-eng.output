This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were coated with a light or carotenoid-colored undercoat.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft (called a spindle), but had other features of feathers - beards and rays - researchers concluded that the spindle was probably a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but for temperature control or for sighting. The researchers suggest that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen is from adult feathers and not from the plumes of a giraffe.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample came from adult feathers and not from the plumes of a giraffe.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by interactions between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their candidacy in an envelope.
After officials have checked the voter's identity, the voter will deposit the envelope and ballot paper and sign the voting list.
French electoral law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly elected and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision according to special procedures.

He was subsequently admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She is being held in pre-trial detention pending her arraignment, but all testimony could be taken as her photo was widely published.
This is common in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and courts have considered the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the criminal prosecution as a whole, told reporters that it would not comment until the indictment is filed.
The document refers to the disputed border area claimed by Palestine based on the borders before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the Valley for ten years, as soon as an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority wants to allow this presence for five years only.
The protectors in the supplemental pest control study should be closely monitored by rangers as the study was monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the deputy director for parks and heritage at the NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service), the four selected shooters for the first shoot were given safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new provisional Walrot (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission welcomed the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failed elections, which have been partially held since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases of overheating iPods, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that one in 27 accidents was related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had shared 34 additional oversight cases that the company had deemed "not significant".
The ministry reacted to the Apple report's ridicule by calling it "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7.19am local time (Friday 9.19am GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage was reported nationwide.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourist.
Some hostages were rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an older dam that had to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate vaginal births in his spare time.
His research showed that when a hormone was inhibited, it would accelerate the fetal lung depletion of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators discovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid their last respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the Extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night of the two moons of us. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I was ... maybe even a little more ... I love her and miss her ... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 polled before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia as a republic have gained 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of the survey respondents share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme of the poll, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games in three heats, but due to his plain, his fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take medication to overcome his pain, as they are prohibited while playing.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people had verified the discovery using various hardware until early February, and the announcement was made on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supplies to Earth, along with organic substances that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and above all, how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year at age 53 and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity".
He is widely speculated to be running for president in the 2016 election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will enable aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of tons of fuel and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to give pilots more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transportation deployed and overflow lanes do not stop at Wembley and parking spaces and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have increased the possibility that the game could be held behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published in Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process likely took much longer due to cross-breeding between an endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza forte, and the mutated cactus frog, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be made into thin wire that can be twisted and cut. It can be worked with a hammer and rolled into leaves.
It can be very thin and be stamped on other metals, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-carved pictures and books, called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in the pH value) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then crush them into a ball with clean, close hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers, which fall together and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a disconnected sewage system.
Relics of surface water systems have been found in the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women met in mixed societies.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, you're calling a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light that is visible.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an indescribable way. The greatest advantage we have thanks to the wheel is much faster and easier means of transport.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbit-eating to antelope and red wolves.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-living domestic cats) that eat much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has, which keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most numerous of the cats, living in large groups, also called flocks.
A rudel consists of one to four adult males, along with up to thirty females and males.
The women are usually close relatives to each other, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lionheads behave much like those of lions or dogs  Animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour  and are also very aggressive towards their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can crawl (though not well), swim, jump far, and pull with the five-fold strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's cry is not like the loud cry of a lover, but rather like a string of broken, spoken words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that eat the ocelot are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find animals for food by sniffing where they were on the ground.
They can see and move around well in the dark, with night vision. They find their prey by adapting to their surroundings and then attacking them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (such as when they move over a mountain or a river, or when they move to a new island and thus cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adjustments as before.
As the new population adapts to its new surroundings, it begins to emit less and less than the other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can never be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is just the formation of a new species.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans absorb.
Plants produce their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes and produce our energy from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the largest predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Long spears were equipped with more than seventy knife-sharp teeth, along with an additional string around the edge, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, its diet included sea cucumbers, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It attacked everything that came into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't keep up with it.
Although most of their food was familiar, the Romans had a number of strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, poultry, slugs, and a type of rodent called the sleeping mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and women sat on silent benches and ate, the rich men liked to hold banquets together, where they sat on the side while eating.
Ale moles in Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe in later centuries from America or Asia.
They had, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate a snail.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built specifically to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were just open doors to the street, and stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse language, Erik de Rouden was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences in terms of the people, kings, kingdoms and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The Templar's Legacy, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text is below the reverse document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (it measures 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up for storage early in his life.
It is therefore likely that the property was simply added as a description.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
One was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and surrendered to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or town-state, and also determines in some way the size of society.
City states are the ancestors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a continuous cultural footprint and an orderly diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear, leaving no significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation first formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on government agencies, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
It also did not have the authority to enact tax laws and levies between states.
The clauses required unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government to task, so that their representatives were often reluctant.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
His sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing at international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing along recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the core production of the natives and hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like before.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
The most commonly used format for still photographs worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio has been overtaken by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually, which can be a bit tricky, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is referred to here as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) correspond to this aspect ratio or approximate it.
The much-abused and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates momentum while maintaining a measure of order and a picture.
She realises that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines, which divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being put to the test.
For over a thousand years, Christian religion has held European states together despite differences in language and culture.
Her all-pervasive power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be spent to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted human rights, codified by multiple international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain had blocked international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire sections of the ocean, which even put neutral ships at risk.
As there was only a limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected a decisive reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations resolved to prevent a recurrence of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of designating different eras: each phase of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a troubled period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years and was split between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest times in ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to get it.
The same was true for the military, because instead of army lists based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired other tyrannized workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things outside of this world, and he frequently visited a cave known as the Hira' on Mount Noor (Light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived for centuries, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all, even if you knew it existed.
There are only clear, beautiful skies above and many surrounding mountains to be seen. If you are in the caves, you can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that is still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giseh Plateau, or "Giseh Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Cheops and eight of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were erected to honor the wives and family members of Cheops.
The "Boomark up" looks like a V and the "Boomark down" looks like a bracket or square with the underside missing.
Above means that you should start at the top and press down on the ball and below means that you should start at the mill (where your hand holds the ball) and press down on the ball.
A high pitched whistle usually generates a darker sound, while a low pitched whistle is stronger and more decisive.
Do not hesitate to mark your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed tree markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be kept in a normal way.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a mob of merchants from Versailles.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a mob member held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the frightened queen.
The cost of US imperialism in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, so a large part of the spending and interest on the bonds was passed on in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the fundamental failings of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the Renaissance took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the era of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000  1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices; from technology-push or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a seemingly inexhaustible logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely goes beyond cultural or political influences and that technology itself has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than socially driven.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
A nationwide road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, however, unless new production methods are developed to reduce costs for vehicle owners.
Mass motorization also leads to higher accident rates on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare field for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a large element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, arose bridges and cultures that were connected to this geography, and that were, because they were in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
Their status declined during the twelfth century largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts like silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the Byzantine culture in the East had a very strong influence on Gezi.
However, Westerners may be 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to attach the gown.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture conducted to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological system that combines ecoregional farming with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together equals who feel neglected by societal standards, and they enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be indistinguishable according to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unchanging and symbolic style of use that includes fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods of questioning the meaning of socialization is to draw on some happy cases of children who, through neglect, bad luck, or excessive abuse by adults, were not socialized while growing up.
Such children are called "wild". Some wild children were taken in by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this task was to repay the child for the repayment of the parents' heavy mental or physical burdens.
Teenage runaways may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others were to be raised by animals; others were to live alone in the wilderness.
When raised by non-human animals, the child exhibits behaviors (including physical limits) that are almost identical to those of the respective animal, such as fear of or similarity to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, Scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but an aid that supports people who are doing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The frameworks can be both virtual and real, in other words, a schoolteacher is a form of frameworks, but this also applies to the small office crammer in Microsoft Office.
Virtual noises are embedded in the software and are meant to ask, demand and explain processes that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are being given to them for poor reasons in care institutions ranging from neglect, to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not supportive, social and educational, but it is the way it is.
We see the care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our care system should provide a safe home, caregivers who have a very warm manner, stable training and reliable health care.
Nursing home care should provide all necessities that are needed in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent nature of the Internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of use and reward.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are considered important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal commitment' and 'continuous relationships' were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they studied audience responses on Internet sites.
The use of video recording has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions  facial movements of a few milliseconds .
First of all, it is claimed that one can recognize whether a person is suffering by correctly interpreting a microexpression.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech because of emotional disturbance are able to judge sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twenty-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Separation and recombination move the variation with each generation between the two poles.
In the savanna, for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
And there are serious consequences if you don't: depression, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are as difficult for primates as for us to digest if not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (seafood, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a protein envelope containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savanna.
Sleep-wake cycle is the process of purposefully waking up during the normal sleep period and then returning to sleep shortly after (10  60 minutes later).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively slow alarm clock to bring you to consciousness, but not fully awaken you.
If you put the watch back on during sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, in case you are forced to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to sleep, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The measure of submissive peace that a person possesses is correlated to the measure of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own negativity and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga is the awakening of Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Guruyoga, whereby various deities are visualized, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to an alliance between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the alliance of systems, processes and culture led to the collapse of the countries.
Two years after the war, the former allies had become enemies, which led to the Cold War.
It was to last for the next 40 years and be fought in earnest by the proxies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and scant other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were almost overturned overnight, however, when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army marched into the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport many people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's traditional role has been to ensure that its nation retains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously interfering with the ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried, mainly with submarines, to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain and the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples kept them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Household spirits were kept in a herd in traps, which were moved to hills or other pastures, often tended by herders, who were often children and adolescents, similar to the well-known herdsmen. This method of herding is still used today.
Dunnebows were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although dune wells consisted mainly of parallel wooden dune, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and with larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Early railings were used to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually discovered that rails were more efficient if they had an ice shelf on top.
This became common practice, but the ice caused more wear on the wooden beams of the vines.
Eventually, wooden bars were replaced by iron bars. In 1767 the first volleys were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking; humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they normally do.
Dubious specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like symptomatic treatment, but if we want to not just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should address it.
It is evident enough that mankind's scientific and technological advances have changed the world greatly and that the problems are growing due to humanity's overpopulation and excessive lifestyle.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few pages further to the printer by John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as the "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on 6 July to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap Fleaves, which we know to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are considered to be binary digits  or bits (for computer language use).
An internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of an underlying poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
The label contains specific first aid instructions for each poison.
The term "chewerleck" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the old familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both bed bugs and bed bugs are brood parasites that have adapted to life in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their or their child's best interests.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Adoption is the act of giving up parental rights to the birth parents so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and this method is definitely the basis of most scientific research.
But it does not do this alone, experimenting  and an experiment is a test that is conducted to test one or more of the possible hypotheses  asking questions and making observations are also part of the conduct of scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views have been accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
In addition, in physiology and in the behavior observed, rhythms often depend decisively on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a real material.
Hershey and Chase have created phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, each of which marked the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive mercury.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the gene material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Just mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit nature reserves to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to drive to their workplace and drive past those whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system that is based on, and supports, private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone cares about transportation systems.
In industrialized countries, one often hears complaints about water quality or bridges that are falling.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation planners just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult, because the driver's behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave in a uniformly consistent area; in this case, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be graphically represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger spread of small places to hide from predators.
Today, water lilies and unicorns are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but others thought the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is the widest river on earth, measuring some 9.7 kilometers (5.5 miles) across.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers worldwide into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Ale Kingdom, the size and technical performance of the construction of the pyramids of Giseh were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Already in antiquity, humans knew basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they can all be discovered in nature in natural form and can be broken down with relatively simple stories.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 aggregate states of matter (in the same sequence): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma; although he also theorized that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Note that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so surreal that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of new writing methods, the pen became less important and used.
People now write messages on computer screens and no longer need spellcasters.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
As a heavy wound heals, the re-splitting of the cell's nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they break apart with little or no impact.
The lunar surface is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the craton.
The cube is about 70 km on the upward side and about 100 km on the downward side.
It is deeper below the marsh and thicker above the highlands.
There could be more marshes on the sloping side, because the lava is thinner, and it was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out how people are ticking or what they are ticking.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been neglected as they enter adulthood.
This theory considers what it is about certain people wanting the things they want, and how certain things in their environment lead them to want certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, there are two types of behaviour that can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues: one end of the spectrum is trying to remain one of the colleagues.
This type of leadership has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibility and holding employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels that you have to change everything that the team has done and make it your own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a liaison to their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to the corresponding time zones, which is not necessarily understood by the local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team, to which each individual member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
When all available resources are effectively deployed in the functional areas of an enterprise, creativity and impact can be expressed.
Here, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customers.
For an organization to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines continuity as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thereby broadening the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of injury, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with valuable information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important area of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
And these things have become separate disciplines that focus on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the fields of business, medicine, technology and the military, but is also embedded in many home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every class, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual excursions, where students can admire museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is updated every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a collectible album.
Blogging can also help improve student writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience can change that in general.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogs "also force students to become more familiar with the world around them". The need to capture the attention of the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
A proper use of blogging "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of comments by others and also emphasize their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and is dotted with a plethora of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls and to the north lie the unparalleled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario what is considered by foreigners to be typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To compare the population, which surprises many, there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of flora and fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country and it was a long way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahelzone, to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that traveling women say they are married, regardless of actual family status.
It also helps to wear a ring (not one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they may perceive as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be bullied, harassed, beaten, etc.
Don't be coy when you talk back to men, and don't be afraid to be assertive (cultural differences, so it's not even true!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronids, under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish merchants who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina you will find light places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tajas, faience, leather goods, hooks and a whole sheaf of wigs are sold, but this is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is equally safe, any visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that is going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla outings in Africa.
You can take a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get you to Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative obscurity, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, far-off lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it is overlooked by an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations during the PBS Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arabic than African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each one providing different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park admission fees.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the area of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glowing ballad diagram, made clear by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island in the direction of the Kowloon Beach promenade opposite.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the clock that the British colonists had been trying to find, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world and stretches from the coast over 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangroves, however, they include some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once stretched across the Ganges.
The Sundarbans extend over an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/supply areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a protected area and it is estimated that there are now 400 king tigers and over 30 000 axishirs in the area.
Buses run all day from the Interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, running between 6.30 and 7.30 am.
As the inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the trails are run by small Japanese coaster-buses, which are very comfortable and robust.
Collecting taxis is a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two 3.5 metres wide footprints.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in present-day Paraguay and were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Rise Province of India", was born as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with the indigenous indigenous group.
For Spain, the colonial era began, lasting three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be watched at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, check out Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is usually accepted everywhere on the islands and credit cards in US dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on the remote islands, although British and US currency is accepted; check in advance with the owners, which is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There is no specific "rain" or "dry" season: the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, one should keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wildlife.
No matter what they look like, bison, elk, deer, bears, and all sorts of large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous; so let them keep their distance.
In addition, be aware that bees and other wildlife attract bees, so avoid the deer or cows of solid food and keep the camps clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of a notorious naval dispute in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, with almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau independence movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the assassination of the top leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches on the shores of Auckland's two harbours, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (also known as the North Harbour) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where one can safely swim, and most offer shade through Pohutukawa-beem.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour and the coastal headlands of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast.
There are two local beers, the main one is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but accepted and served; the other one is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines that one must have tried, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be easier to get there.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but mineral water is easy to find if you're not sure.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is exotic. A short black is called an 'espresso', cappuccino has top drip (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot cocoa is of Belgian standard. The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many races are held throughout the year and injuries due to any of these races are rare.
Nevertheless, authorities are asking for advice, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770 the sea turtles have been found on the beaches and estuaries from October to April, and sometimes outside this period.
Sharks are there, but they attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveler can be assured that he will be able to sleep somewhere else when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, although you may be able to book other accommodation such as camping through a travel agent.
Travellers usually offer packages that include coffee, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also suspend the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your travel destination (e.g. visa).
Any comments or queries should be directed to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the largest portion of the music festival participants choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right in the middle of the action, you have to get up early to get a campsite next to the music.
Please note that even if the music on the main stage is closed, there may still be areas of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are travelling through the North Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the melting of ice can cause some pretty gruesome noise for those most affected.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually take strong measures to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits are difficult to find.
They regularly offer special food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests at ease and on the property.
Some venues do offer drinks on the house, but alcohol impairs judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On the green and snowy roads, the traffic is low and you can't drive like you would drive on Makadam.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to make a tree stand.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or blown snow or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic is mostly unobstructed throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to get close to cars and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, leopards and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
A bush safari (also known as a " bush walk", " hiking safari" or " walking safari") consists of hiking trips, each lasting several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at various venues across Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation conditions vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation guidelines do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a wire and a stretcher that can be borrowed even if you are not in the room.
If no stretch is available, or you do not feel like wearing stretchy socks, you can try using a fön if available.
Care should be taken not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to burn or, in extreme cases, burn the fabric).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filters have different effects, and if you have any concerns, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests in their home regions that they are not familiar with.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not normally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through remote woods.
If you are used to driving on country roads, keep your senses: avoid steep, narrow streets and sharp curves.
The current speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 56  64 km/h (35  40 mph) - and adhering to them is even more important than ever.
Strangely, however, the mobile service is much stronger here than along other stretches of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German Bakers are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit cake is common; apples are baked all year round and chips and crackers are added in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hyssop and other legumes.
If you are looking for small but rich pastries, try what is offered as Berliner, pancake or potato depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can vary depending on the liquid content from "dry" to "to a sauce".
In the coastal regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often eaten with curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often eaten.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a large selection of regional cuisines from across the nation.
When used without further qualification, however, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offering a variety of simple dishes, with the predominant flavors being cacao, chiles, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The legs are supports for the rider's feet and hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can raise safety concerns, as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but one foot remains on the bridle, he may be struck when the horse runs away.
First, all riders carry riding boots with a valley and a smooth, fairly narrow, sole.
Next, some suits, especially English suits, were safety belts that allowed a climbing rope to fall off the suit when pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley is Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its rare large granite walls and cliffs.
Some offer breathtaking views of the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are finding new routes through the endless potential of the walls.
Descent sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving walking, snow-covered terrain with skis attached to the feet, or downhill skiing.
Boating is a major recreational activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally called "boat fanatics", planning their entire vacation around boating at a designated location.
The idea of sailing is very old, with cave paintings depicting sailors dating back to around 5000 BC.
Skating as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first free-kick club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called toureschilf, skiing or ski walking.
It is related to, but not usually associated with, alpine-only tours or mountaineering, the latter of which takes place on steep terrain and requires much more rigid skiing and footwear.
Think of the trail as a long, winding path.
In good conditions, you can cover a little more distance than walking, but very rarely can you reach the speed of running without heavy backpacks on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would involve some visa and passport checks.
The Schenge space functions in this respect just like a country.
